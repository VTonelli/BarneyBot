# Project of Natural Language Processing: BarneyBot

## Abstract
We developed a chabot using pretrained model of DialoGPT from transformer library of ![Hugginface][logoHF], performing a fine tuning of its small version on some corpus of data coming from tv show or movie saga.

We choise to extend the work made by [Nguyen et al.](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2761115.pdf) who explored the task implementing a chatbot by a seq-to-seq model. As previously said we decided to approch the problem by implementing a more sophisticated model architecture i.e. DialoGPT.
