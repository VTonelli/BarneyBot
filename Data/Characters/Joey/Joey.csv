And you never knew she was a lesbian...,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!",No you don't.

I say push her down the stairs.,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.","If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!,I say push her down the stairs.,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.","Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.",I helped!
"What, like there's a rule or something?","Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!","And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
Who's Paul?,"Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!","It's, uh, it's Paul."

"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?","Okay, sure.","Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",La-la-la-la...ohhh!
What's this?,It's a beautiful thing.,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Which goes where?,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.,What's this?
Done with the bookcase!,I have no idea.,Which goes where?
"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.","This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.",All finished!
"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?","Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.","Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
You got screwed.,"Oh, God.",You guys.
Shut up!,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-"
"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!","You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...","Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
"Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,","Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!

Congratulations.,That is amazing.,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...","If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.","Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
"Morning, Paul.",Morning.,Morning. Good morning.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,Yeah.,We'll talk later.
"Yeah, I'm an actor.","Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.","So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?,"Yeah, I'm an actor."
"Look, it was a job all right?","Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.",I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
I will not take this abuse.,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'","Look, it was a job all right?"
"You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler?","You're right, I'm sorry.  Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...",I will not take this abuse.
Of course it was a line!,"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.",You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?","All right, c'mere, gimme your feet."
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,I just grabbed a spoon.,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.","I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.",Yes!
"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?","What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.","Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
....Are we still talking about sex?,"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.","The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.",Are you through with that?,...Then I've already seen this one!
"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.","Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.","Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
Oh! Yeah!,"Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!","Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..."
"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?",Oh! Yeah!,"Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!"
".....Well, this is still ruined, right?","I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.",So what are you gonna do?
"Your folks are really that bad, huh?",And you knew about this?!,"Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
What are we supposed to be seeing here?,Well? Isn't that amazing?,I know.
"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",Since when?,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'."
Yeah. Cushions the blow.,And everybody knows this?,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.",So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
Thanks! Let's keep going.,"Hey, that was really good!","Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.","Okay. So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?",Thanks! Let's keep going.
What?,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,Smoke away.
Whoah!,Not so much!,Relax your hand!
Hey!,Hey!,Whoah!
"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.",Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
Y'miss it?,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.","It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
That's ridiculous!,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.","Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke."
"Y'okay, Phoebe?",Good for me!,"Yeah. Yeah, excellent."
What are you talking about? Keep it!,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.","Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
So when do we get to meet the guy?,"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.",This Alan again? How's it goin'?
"Let it go, Ross.","Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..","I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!",Chandler? Do you promise to be good?,Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Chandler! He's here!,It's Alan.,Hey. It's him.  Who is it?
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.,Yeah.,And did you notice...?
Alan.,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?","Oh, why is it unfair?"
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?","Well, I-I could live without it.",...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
"Oh,  you do, do you?","Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.","Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
Do you have any respect for your body?,"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.","Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
What's going on?,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!",You're kidding. Oh my God.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..,Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.,What's going on?
"Oh, God!","Uh, Joey..",Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?,We didn't change..,"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
Okay!,"Look, I- I could go on pretending-","You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-"
Probably kill myself!,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?","Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy."
"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!",..Excuse me?,Probably kill myself!
"You are? Ross, I'm sorry..","Joey, uh- OMnipotent.","Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.",Thanks.,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
"Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.",You got waaaay too much free time.,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here."
"We love you, man.","Happy birthday, pal!","Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you."
So?,"Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.","We love you, man."

"The hell with hockey, let's all do that!","Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.",Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
"C'mon, Ross!",I have no idea.,What are you doing?
"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.","Oh, this is not that bad.","God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that."
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!,And while we're on the subject of news..
What?,"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.",We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
-Peaches?,"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-","Yes, Bunny?"

"C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.","No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...",What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
"Well, how long do you think it'll be?","Well, you'll have to wait your turn.","Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented."
"He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.","Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?",I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.

"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.","We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.",Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
"No plans, huh?","So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!",Multiple orgasms!
"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.","No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.","Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
"My god, Angela.","Hi, Joey.","Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.",Are you gonna go over there?,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
You look good.,Joey.,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela."

What?,"Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?","Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."

"So, you and Angela, huh?",I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,What?

"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.","Huh, I never really noticed.","You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."

What?,Oh my god.,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"

"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.","Oh my god, what were you thinking?","Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
Ow!,Oh!,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",I'm outta here.,Ow!
"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",Really?,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.","I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.","Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."

And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me.

"Hold on, you-you knew?","Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.",Oww! Big ring!
"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!","Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. I'm sleeping over at my accountant's, I mean, what is that? Please!","Hold on, you-you knew?"
"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?","Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.","So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
I'm...happy...for you?,"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.","Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"

"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.","So you talked to your dad, huh.","Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'."
"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.","So Joey, you okay?",Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.

"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.","Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?","But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.","Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...","Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
"Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.","Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...","No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.

"Uh, we might be leaving now.","Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",What? What can't you do?

"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.","Ok, you can not do this to me.","She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."

That's what it says.,Funniest? Heckles?,"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school."
What?,Whoa!,I'd call that excessive.

Have you been here all night?,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?","So, you were both dorks. Big deal."
"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.","Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.",Have you been here all night?

"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",How do you know that? How?,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?","You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?","I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?","Yeah, I understand.","Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"

"I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.","Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?",I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK.

"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.  Chandler puts the tape in",Pop it in.,What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex.

"Me too, we should get goin'.","Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",That saves us a conversation.
I got time.,I got the time to get to know Julie.,"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
"Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?",What?,I'm goin' home.
Do we need a cake?,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.","Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?"
All right.,It's Ross.,But it's Ross.

"Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.  Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.","That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.","Look I want you, now."

"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?",Morning.,"Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.

"Monica, how are you gonna do that?","Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.","Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place."
"Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'",You have two new messages.,"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.","Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.","Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'"
Now she sounded breezy.,"Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.","Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
Okay.,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, Get out of my chair, dillhole!","Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you."
"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.",What are you doing?,Okay.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.,The cushions are the essence of the chair!,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions."
Where's my underwear?!,"Hey, what you do on your own time...",The sheep.
"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.","Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?",He took my essence!
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?","Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.","Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.",It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
"Hey, opposite, is opposite!","What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?","Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you."
"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?,She's just getting dressed.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.",Oooo-ooh!,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...

You could drink the fat.,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.","Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed."
Yaaaay!,I think you should drink the fat.,What?
Let's see what else he'll do!,You were gonna drink the fat.,"Well, yeah."
WHOAA!!,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear.","But, you left the chair area."

"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.","Aww, is it broken?",Hey.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
What is this? Fruit?,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just fell out of the socket.",Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
"Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",Monica's making jam.,What is this? Fruit?
This will just be my batch.,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.",Because the kids need new shoes.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?,Shoot.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.","Hey, Phoebe."
Aww.  Ohh!,"Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.",Hey Mon.

"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.",Hoyt?,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
He's got the body for it.,"Really, is he a swimmer?","It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool."
"You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.",I like that.  What?,He's got the body for it.
"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.",We do not have one of those signs.,"You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
Yeah!,Two girls and a boy?,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids."
"Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.","And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.",Yeah!
Oh Monica. .,Yeah.,"Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too."
"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.",Oh Monica. .,Yeah.
Did I get it?,"Honey, you got a little thing on your...","I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person."

Can we please turn this off?,And there is Kevin.,Aw! There's got to be a better way!
"Now, I can have milk everyday.","Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  This works with any milk carton.",You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Hey!,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.","Well, let's go to a bad one and make out."
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!,"Hey, man. What's up?",Hey.
How is it you?,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!","Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
"Yep, that's my audition.","Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.",How is it you?
"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.",What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.,"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.",That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance."
"What, what are you doing? What are you doing?","What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .","Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents."
"Hang up, hang up.","No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'","What, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
I love that movie.,I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?,"Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?"
"I'm sorry, it just felt nice.","There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",I love that movie.
"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.,"I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
"Hey, you know about that?!","Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.","I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid."
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,Where there is no fear of commitment.
"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",You think?,"Amazingly, that makes sense."
"Come on baby, come on!","Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.","Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
Thank you so much.,Unbelievable.,"Op, went through a tunnel."
"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.","It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",Thank you so much.
"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.","Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.","You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."

"Nooo, four.","Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right","Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?,G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?,"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi."
Go Joe!!!,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Pheebs! There you are!,Go Joe!!!,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
"But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!","No it's not, sorry.",Pheebs! There you are!
"Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.","Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.","But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!"
"It's okay, these things happen.","Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.","Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it."
"I'm, I'm okay. See.","But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.","It's okay, these things happen."
"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.","Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.","I'm, I'm okay. See."
They actually said that?,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.","No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.","Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...",They actually said that?
"Okay, shoot.","Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.",Can I be that guy?
I didn't get it?,"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.","Okay, shoot."
"Okay, what else?","No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.",I didn't get it?
Oh.,"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'","Okay, what else?"
"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.","Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",Oh.

Maybe we should check the trash chute.,"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.","Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.",Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.,Maybe we should check the trash chute.
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.,You walked around all night in the city by yourself?,"I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."

So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.",This would be the place where you explain the hat.,Sorry.
"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.",And you're gonna make them all disappear.,"Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right?

The last thing she said to me was; Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter. And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter."
Really? A purse?,"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.","All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."

"Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey,",And a date with a man!,"Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part."
"Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.","Any time you're ready, Joey.",But the minute we start to lie to each other  And by 'we' I mean society.
"Yeah, sure.","I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?","Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink."
"Well, first it's not a purse.",Sure. What?,"Yeah, sure."

"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",What kind of problem?,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me."
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,Nooooo!,Oh my God!
"I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!","Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
I can't believe I'm hearing this!,I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,"Oh, hey!"

You mean how they're friends and nothing more?,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,What? What?
"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!","Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?","No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window."

I can't take any,"Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.","No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them."

"So, are you ready to go?",Hi!,Hi!
"Oh sure, right back there.","Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.","So, are you ready to go?"

She keeps punching me.,But what?,"I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but"
"Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay?  She-she-she's hurting me.","In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?",She keeps punching me.

"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay?

I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?"
Hey! Hiya!,Hi!,"Well look, Im breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"

She's right y'know.,Hey!,Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?","Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.","Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?"
"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.","No, I will not!","Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?"

"Hey, you guys!","Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!","Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."
"Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?",Hey.,Hey Joey!
"Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and Im not him.","Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?","Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?"

What?! Why?!,"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.","Yeah, I didnt know you guys were going to be here."

"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,","Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",Nothing!
"Well, it involved Monica.",Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it.,"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,"
"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.","You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!","Well, it involved Monica."
"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",What was the dream about?,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish."
It-it doesnt?,"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesnt mean that-that you're in love with me!","Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out."
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",No!
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Not really.,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",Um-hmm.
"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?","Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",Well there you have it!
Friends first? That's interesting.,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?","No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
"No, never done that either.",You become friends after?,Friends first? That's interesting.
How you doin'?,What's up Joey?,That's right.
"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.","Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",Oh.
"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.",Thanks!,"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you."
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.,I know.,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great",What's up Joe?,Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
"is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, Who are my friends? You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So",Yeah?,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great"
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,What are you saying?,"is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, Who are my friends? You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So"
I'll treat you real nice.,"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Won't-won't that take longer?,"Yeah, well, y'know umm No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",I'll treat you real nice.
"Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!","Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",Won't-won't that take longer?
Hey!,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?","I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!"
"Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.",Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?,Hey!
"Uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed.","Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?","Yeah, yeah, I met this woman."
"Well look, hey, it's all your fault!","Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!","Uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed."
"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!",What?! Why?!,"Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,What about the closeness?,"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!"
"All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!",Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,What about the closeness?

"I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.",Wh-what?!,"Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"
"That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday,  same as the day before.","Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.",Did I squeeze it too hard?
"Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.",Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?,"That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday,  same as the day before."
"Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.","Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.",Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?

"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?"
"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed."
"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.","You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.","Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?","Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
"Ooh, that's a great plan!","Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...","Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan-laugh.","Ooh, that's a great plan!"
Hey.,"Ooh, Joey.",Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
All right! Who is he?,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,Hey.
"Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.","Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",All right! Who is he?
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,"Oh, yeah.","Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross."
"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",A teacher?,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
"Oh my god, you're right!","Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!","Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
She even reads for pleasure!,Yeah.,"Oh my god, you're right!"
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,How do you even know a woman like that?,She even reads for pleasure!
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,Joey.,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",So now what do we do?,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Ooh...I hear that's bad.,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!","Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else."
"Ah, yes, The Plan!","Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",Ooh...I hear that's bad.
"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.","It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...","Ah, yes, The Plan!"
"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.","Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.","My dear, sweet Rach."
Hello?,"Okay, I'll try.","Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
Emma? Hey! Hi!,Hello?,"Okay, I'll try."
"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",Emma? Hey! Hi!,Hello?
"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!","How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",Emma? Hey! Hi!
Because you two were having sex!,Why the hell did you take her?,"Oh, we were playing peek-a-boo. She just  she loves it when I'm dramatic."
Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,"No, we weren't!",Because you two were having sex!
Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
"Hey, I gotta! Unless...","No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!","No, no, no."
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,Unless what?,"Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",What? Why?,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
You almost had me.,Your family name is Tribbiani.,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
Uh-huh.,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",Female body inspector? What size is that?
"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.",How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,Uh-huh.
"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.","Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.","Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show."
Where?,"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!","Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
Can you believe they're still not here?,Mexico!,Where?
"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?","I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?",Can you believe they're still not here?
We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.,What?,"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
"Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!","Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what",I have such fat hands!
"Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.","Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.","Oh, honey, that's incredible!"
Hey!,"Yes, I did, I did!  I should have written it down!","Ross, you did not come up with got milk?"

"I don't know, but it sounds great.",What is she talking about?,I did?
With Lennart Haze?,Your agent called. You got that audition.,"I don't know, but it sounds great."
"Oh my god, that is great! That is  for a play on broadway and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.",Yes.,With Lennart Haze?
"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.",Is it a good play?,"Oh my god, that is great! That is  for a play on broadway and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time."
"Yeah, yeah, and directing.","Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it","Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word."
Ah!,"No, but I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.",You saw that?
"Yeah, he's done some amazing works.",Ah!,"No, but I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass."
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!,Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!,"Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials."
It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.,"This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.","Uhm, it's USA, sir."
Tell me about it! Unlimited nights and weekends!,"Well, I've I've been blessed with a a lot of great roles.",It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.
"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.","You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out.  I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.",Tell me about it! Unlimited nights and weekends!
Yeah.,Really?,"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon,"Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.",Yeah.
Wow!,Peeeeeooooooooch  Hang up that phone! One take!,Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon
"Oh, yah, sure.","So, shall we read?",Wow!

"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.","Go, go!",I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.

"You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.","Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.","You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. ."
Yeah.,"Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?","You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please."
I really doubt that.,"Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.",Yeah.
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?,"No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.",I really doubt that.
"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.","Hey, how did the audition go?","Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up"
"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",What happened?,"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me."
Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.",So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.

"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?",You're late!,I know I mugged Ross!
But I'm bursting with u-hu!,"No, Lennart doesn't wait!","I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"

We gotta get more of that.,"Joey, that was formula.","Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"

"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.","Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.","No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!",Look at all these paleontologists!!,Wow! This place is beautiful!
"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!","Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!","I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!"
That... never happens...,"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!","I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called The Days of Our Lives.",Are you a paleontologist?,"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.","Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives... there's no the.","No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called The Days of Our Lives."

Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?,You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!,Hey!

Will you wear a thong?,But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.,Yeah.

"No, why?","Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?","Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
Oh man!,"No, why?","Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?"
"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!","There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!",Oh man!
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,"Man, that's some bad advice!","They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say No, David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again."
"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!",Hey! Hey what's going on?,Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in",That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!,"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!"
Hey guys!,"Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .",It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Damnit!,The chocolates aren't here yet.,Hey guys!
"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?","Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",It's not the time Charlie.
It's really gone?,"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!",NO! I don't!!
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.,I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?,"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."
"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.","Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .",Wha... what you really think we can do that?
"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a Galaxy far, far away? .","Alright, ok, let's do it.  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.",Ugh.
"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",This vacation sucks!!,"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.","Well, I've brought some books. We could read.","I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.","Well, I've brought some books. We could read."

"Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.",Me neither.,I didn't do that.
"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?","I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.","Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun."
"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?","Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...","Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
"There it is, you're blushing!",No.,"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?"
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?,"No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.","There it is, you're blushing!"

"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...",I had a great time.,"Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much."
Yeah.,"So, shall we?",Later! La...
Night.,Good night.,Bye.
He said erectus!,What?,"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster  1  is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus..."
"No, he really said it.","You're... you're kidding, right?",He said erectus!
Erectus?,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...,"No, he really said it."
"Yeah, and so funny!","Oh, thank you so much!",It was really... great!
Hey!,Hey! There you are!,I clunked your heads together!
"Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...","I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.",Hey!
"Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!","Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!",You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night...
"Yeah! A little bit, yeah...",... is it weird that it's not with each other?,Yeah...

"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!","Oh, that's crazy!","Oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!","... yeah, it's true.","No, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
"Ok, Rach!","What, hey!","I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!"
"I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?","Ok, Rach!","What, hey!"
"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...","W-What are you, what are you talking about?","I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?"
"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!",Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...,"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like..."
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?,"Yeah, I'm not talking about her...","I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
"No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?",You know? Forget it!,But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?

What the hell are you doin'???,Shoot!,I just have one question!
"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!","I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...",What the hell are you doin'???
"CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!",Who...?,"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!"
"Yeah, he had a paper route.","Oh yes, of course, I remember him!","CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"

"NO, NO! It can't happen at all!",But can it... just... happen a little bit?,"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I couldn't do it to Ross!","But why, why not?","NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"
"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!",But that wasn't gonna stop you before!,"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I couldn't do it to Ross!"

Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!,Ooh... I love Barbados!,"Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend."
"Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...","Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?",Thank you.
"Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?","Other wall, people! Other wall!",Thanks!
No idea what it means.,"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!","Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?"
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...,"Yeah, sure...",Can I talk to you for a minute?
Is he gone?,Joey!,You would think!
Pssst...,How are you doing this?,Is he gone?
"Well, he's with Charlie now.",Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?,"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!"
"You're a pain in my ass, Geller!","Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?","Well, he's with Charlie now."
"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.",Are they right?,Get out!
"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...","Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.","Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross."
I like although!,Although...,"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off..."
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...,"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...",I like although!
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.,"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.",Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...

Let's forget about Ross...,Yeah...,I'm thinking about you...
What's wrong?,Forgotten.,Let's forget about Ross...
Seriously... What is it?,Nothing...,What's wrong?
What's wrong?,"Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...",Seriously... What is it?
"Well, maybe I can help.","Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...",What's wrong?
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...,"Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...","Well, maybe I can help."
"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.",What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.,And listen to this...
"Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?","Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.","Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up."
I understand...,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.","Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?"
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.,Okay... Good luck.
Ooh...,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
I'm gonna get the lasagna.,Still nervous?,Ooh...
Hey!,Hey!,"Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!"
Yeah?,"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.",Hey!
You kissed.,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...",Yeah?
I saw you.,Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?,You kissed.
"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.","Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.",I saw you.
"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.",What?,"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay."
Yeah... Now I have something...,Are you serious?,"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy."
Oh... uh... look... before you...,"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?",Yeah... Now I have something...
"I am those things, yeah.","No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...",Oh... uh... look... before you...
Dude!,"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...","I am those things, yeah."
I can't think of anything.,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",Dude!
Yeah.,Thanks!,I can't think of anything.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.,"Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?",Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.","Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Hey!,"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",Some of these look a little frayed.
"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",Hi!,Hey!
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.","Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.","So, did you err... did you tell Ross?"
"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.","Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.","No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory."
"I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.","Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...","Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together."
Yeah! Good night!,"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?","I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals."
Good night!,Goo--ood night!,Yeah! Good night!
Stop saying good night.,"Seriously, good night!",Good night!
"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?","She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.","Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much."
"Rach, he just saw us.",We weren't doing anything!,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?"
"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",Shhh.,"Rach, he just saw us."
"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..","Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.","No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados."
"Yeah, but it did happen, so...","We feel so terrible about this, Ross.","Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
Ross?,"Yeah, but it did happen, so...","We feel so terrible about this, Ross."
Yeah.,So you two are..?,"Ross, say something. Anything."
"No, no, no!",And have you .. ed?,Yeah.
Probably.,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?","No, no, no!"
"No, no!",Probably.,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
Really?,"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!","No, but you know what I mean."
Ross..,Absolutely.  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.,Really?
"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?","No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!",Calm ourselves?
I do like fajitas.,"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!","Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",Willing to adopt triplets? No!,"Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him."
"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...","Well, what would we be doing?","Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
In a carriage!,Feel me up?,"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
"Hey, Charlie!",In a carriage!,Feel me up?
"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?","Oh, you bet.","Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?"
"Oh. Oh, thanks.",Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.,"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?"
"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..","And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.","Oh. Oh, thanks."
"Uh, actually, that's..",Oh! That is so thoughtful.,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine."
"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?,"Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little..."
"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?","Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.","Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
"Dude, are you okay?","O is for oh, wow! The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.","Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.,I don't even know what that's for.,"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good."
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
"It doesn't look good, does it?","Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.",Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Morning. Here you go.,"It doesn't look good, does it?","Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
Yeah.,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?,Morning. Here you go.
"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.",So you took off my pants and shoes?,Yeah.
"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..",What do you mean?,"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen."
"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.","Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!","Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.."
"That's what I hear, yeah.","Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?","It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel."
"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...","This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?","That's what I hear, yeah."

"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.","Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.",I think so.
"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?","No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?","Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
And we're okay?,"Yeah, I'm sure.","No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?"

"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.",Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?,Yeah. It's actually our first official date
It's OK!,What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.,"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!",How can you be so confident?,It's OK!
"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.",Really? Like you have a routine?,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.",Really?,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness."
"NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.",You mean like this?,"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh."

"That's some gentle comedy, dude.",Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!,"Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four."
Yeah!,"We're still going at the game, right?","That's some gentle comedy, dude."
"Oh, Bob, get off the guy!",Because I already did!,Why not!

Okay.,One more fight!,I don't know...
How late are we?,I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!,Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Wow,Forty-five minutes.,How late are we?
"Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!",Here!,Wow
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!",You may want to lose the foam finger!,"Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!"
You are not at Thanksgiving?,Oh!,Hey!

"Yeah, where were you!","So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!","Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!"
"Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...",And it looks like she put makeup on her!,You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?

No. Here,"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!","Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!"
Who do you think its from?,"You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.",That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.","Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.","Well, let's just go in there and face them."
Ah-haah! I win!!,"Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .","I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
That's fire. Beats everything.,What is that?,Ah-haah! I win!!
"Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.","Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .",That's fire. Beats everything.

"Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.","You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.","Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us."
I'm telling ya...  I can do it.,I don't know...,"Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us."
"Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...",Oh!,"Yeah, he can do it!"
"Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.",Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!,The cranberries...?
"Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  Right guys?","He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!","Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."
"Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?","So, so sorry.",I feel terrible.
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!,"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.","Really girls, not cool."
Don't make me come up there!,It's a day to be thankful.,Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.,It's too late for apologies.,Don't make me come up there!
