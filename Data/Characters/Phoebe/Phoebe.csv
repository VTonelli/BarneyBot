Maybe there's someone else.,"No, I'm just....",Does he not make enough money?
"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like forget about her but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, Oh my god. So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh!

"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",No you're not.,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."

"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.",Can we see her?,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."

I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait!","I'd do anything for you, you know that.","Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong.

"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.","Ok, Phoebe.","Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",Such as?,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
Nah. Not really.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?","Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",You don't believe in evolution?,Nah. Not really.

"See, I didn't know that.","You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",Really? You can actually see it?
"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?","Well, there you go.","See, I didn't know that."
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?","Ok, while you mmm on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",Please tell me you're joking.,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.","No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--","Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
He's even kind of cute.,"Wow, he looks so normal.","Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook."

Hi!,You're so pretty.,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.","Hey, Phoebe.",Hi!
"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.",You talked to him. Are you crazy?,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today."
"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know.

No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know.

"Um, not even a little bit.","Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?","Oh, yeah. What's this?"
"Oh, okay then.",It's about you.,"Um, not even a little bit."
Good. So what were you thinking?,"I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.","Oh, okay then."

Oh.,No.,Really?
"Oh, okay.","See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.",Oh.
Hellooo!,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.","Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here."
"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.",How's the maniac?,Hey.
"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.","Phoebe, what are you doing?","Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."
"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.","Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.","Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me."
"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?",You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
What are you saying I should do?,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.","What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?"
"Thank you, Monica.","I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",What are you saying I should do?
Yes? Yes! Oh.,Phoebe?,"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God."
"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.",What are you doing?,Yes? Yes! Oh.
"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.",Were you following me?,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh."
"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?",So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."
"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.","I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.","Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?","Uh-huh, I don't know.","No, no, it's not your fault.

Hey.,Hey!,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back."
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!","Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.",How is it you?,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!"
"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.","See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.","Yep, that's my audition."
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.",What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .","Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.",That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'","What, what are you doing? What are you doing?","What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh ."
"'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'","Hang up, hang up.","No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'"
"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?","Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.","Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'","Come on baby, come on!","Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents."
"Op, went through a tunnel.",Very nice touch.,"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",Thank you so much.,Unbelievable.
"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.","You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.","It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
Two?,"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.","Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right","Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.",Two?
"No it's not, sorry.",Pheebs! There you are!,Go Joe!!!
"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.","But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!","No it's not, sorry."
"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.","Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.","Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants."
"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.","It's okay, these things happen.","Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.","I'm, I'm okay. See.","But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.","No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.","Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit."
"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...",They actually said that?,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent."
"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.","No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.","Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.",Can I be that guy?,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?"
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.","Okay, shoot.","Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on."
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.",I didn't get it?,"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'","Okay, what else?","No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",Oh.,"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
Oh.,"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.","Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
"Yeah, no, I understand.","Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.",Oh.
Yeah. Sorry.,"You do, thanks.","Yeah, no, I understand."
What?,Wait a minute.,Yeah. Sorry.
"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.","Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.",What?

"Yeah, no, Ralph doesnt look anything like that guy. Hes-hes young and hes got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",What?,Thats not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
What?,"Oh My God, Phoebe, thats not Ralph Lauren. Thats Kenny the copy guy.","Yeah, no, Ralph doesnt look anything like that guy. Hes-hes young and hes got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack."
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?,"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",What?
Ohhh.,To get you to make out with him!!!,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?  OH!! Demon!! Demon!!,No. I am not putting on makeup.,"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see."
But why didnt you just tell her the truth.,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.","Its not what you said. Its the way you said it.Oh My God, Im a women!!!"

"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...",What are you gonna do?,"Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.",You have to tell David!,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
Hey!,Hey!,Heeeeeey!
Okay.,And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.,Was your cabin pressurised?
"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...",Were you there?,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken."
Oof...,"Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.",Hi! There you are.
"Oh, wait, wait!","In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.",Oof...
"No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.","Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...","Oh, wait, wait!"
"Yeah, I should have told you.",Oh... oh...,"No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.","No... well, yeah.","Yeah, I should have told you."
I am happy.,"Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?","I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.","Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...",I am happy.
"Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...",Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?,"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do."
I mean...,No... no...,"Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
Yeah?,In Minsk...,I mean...
"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...",...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.,Yeah?
"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.","Okay, what? What is too sensitive?",Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
"No, no. No.","But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.","Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad."
"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...",But... ergo...,"No, no. No."
And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.,"Well... hey, the key works...!",Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui...
"No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.",So... how many guys have your key?,Yep! That's my thing...
"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.","Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.",Your lipstick's on his mouth.
"No, no...",Did you uhm...,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
"Oh, well, yeah...",...kiss him?,"No, no..."
"Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!  Here David, you should just go.",Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...,Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
"Okay, well... guys?","Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.","Well, I might."
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.","Right-o, right-o...","Hey, what are you kidding me?"
Right! Never! Never! I swear!,It's never gonna happen again right?,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand."

"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.","Thank you, I think so too.",Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.,Is he really?,"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women."
"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way.

I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.",Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...,You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?

You are a terrific actor.,Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying."
Thats a great movie. she claps,"no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.",Thank you Amy.
PHOE-BE.,"Emma, Ross wants you.",Emma.
No you're all about the fun.,"Thats not how you see me, is it?",Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
There's your movie! claps,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?","I lie better then that, right?"
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. whiny voice And they all got to meet Santa!,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.
"Ooh, what happened?","Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.

It's all right. You can mourn.,uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.,Are you okay Mon?
"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?","Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. knocks over the box of china Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",She needs changing.
"Broke them all, huh?",Nope...,"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?"

"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as eye-contact.","Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.",So? What if they do?
"Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.","So, we're on our way to a couple of parties. Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.",That's my bubby!

"Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.","Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?","Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.","Oh, thanks.","Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation."

He says he can't do that.,I can't do that!,"I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to intercept all his calls."

"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?",Okay.

You could do that?,"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?","Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."

"Okay, now. What?","Okay, okay, okay!  You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on action!

"Okay, that helps.","Well, don't be.","I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous."
"Hey. So, what did he say?",Hey.,"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.","Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word puppy. Okay, so he said: If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.","Hey. So, what did he say?"
Joey.,"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.","I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor."
Who dies?,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!",Joey.

"Okay, from the top, people!",The rest of the scene.,"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?"
"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?","You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual",What!? You faked it?
"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.","Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.","Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.","Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.","Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans."
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,Nice.,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
About what?,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,He slept with you and then never called you.,About what?
"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.","Cut, cut! What are you doing!?","I'm surprised to, but yet here I am."
I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?","Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",What?,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened."
"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,Now that Rachel's gone?
No. It starts with a v and ends with an x. Helpfully with a to in the middle.,Lima.,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
What?,"You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS vtox.  Oh god! Oh!",No. It starts with a v and ends with an x. Helpfully with a to in the middle.
"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.","OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.",What?
"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.","What, is he your pet rat?","Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
What are those?,"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.","Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies."
"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!,What are those?
"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.",Thank you.,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
Hey Mikey,Fine.,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else."
What are you doing?,Hey P,Hey Mikey
To kill Bob??,Setting rat traps.,What are you doing?
"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.","No, no, to test his neck strength.",To kill Bob??
"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!","Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.","No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",Better think of a new name for him.,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!"
"Oh my god, we killed Bob!","I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...","I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
Suzie?,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.","Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!","Oh, give me!","Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!"
"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",So this is what a stroke feels like.,"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother."
"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.","whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?","No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them."
"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.","It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!","Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem."
"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.","Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?","Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,"Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?","Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
No.  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?,"Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a love the one you're with kind of animals.",Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.","Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.",No.  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
You must think I'm crazy.,It's gonna be ok.,"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites."
"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't told you about that yet, have I?","No, I think you're sweet.",You must think I'm crazy.
Hey,"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ...","Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying."
"Listen, I think I've left something here.",Hi,Hey

"Ooh, maybe that's him!",Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!,"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."

On how far along he's in the sex change process!,On...?,Well it depends.
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,"

While drinking...,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.,I'm there!

"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross"

OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?,Yeah I do rock that one.,"Yeah you're always singing Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone",Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.,"All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of I touch myself. Coming up next we've got Monica"
Can you totally see through her shirt ?,Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing Delta Dawn,"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone"
Every little bit of you!,"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y. I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?","Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
"Mon', not that you didnt sound good, but...",Sure.,"I cant believe I did this. I cant believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that"
Oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.,"Ok, for my next song I think Ill sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer",Comb my eyelashes.
"Yes, she gives the people what they want.",Oh my God!,And they love me!
"Oh? Isnt that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.",Are those my wifes nipples?,"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this"

"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.","Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.",What you got?
"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.","I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.","Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food."
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,Why are they doing this?,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.","Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?","Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.","You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
"Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?"
"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan-laugh.","Ooh, that's a great plan!","Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
"Ooh, Joey.",Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,Hey.,"Ooh, Joey."
"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",All right! Who is he?,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
"Oh, yeah.","Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.","Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
A teacher?,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,"Oh, yeah."
"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!","Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",A teacher?
Yeah.,"Oh my god, you're right!","Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!"
How do you even know a woman like that?,She even reads for pleasure!,Yeah.
Joey.,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,How do you even know a woman like that?
So now what do we do?,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,Joey.
"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!","Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",So now what do we do?
"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",Ooh...I hear that's bad.,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!"
"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...","Ah, yes, The Plan!","Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
"No, I think we killed it.","Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.","It's not Santa's plan. No, it's..."
Hello?,Really?,I do like my hair.
"Hey, Rach!","Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",Hello?
"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,"Hey, Rach!"
"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."
Did he go out for a cigarette?,He's not stoned.,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
"My dear, sweet Rach.","Yeah, four times.",Did he go out for a cigarette?
"Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.","My dear, sweet Rach.","Yeah, four times."
"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.  Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.","Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.","Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone."
"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",Female body inspector? What size is that?,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this."
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,Uh-huh.,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.","It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.",How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.","Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.","It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.","Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.","Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.","We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.","Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid."
"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!","Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.","We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding."

What's your news?,Let's get past the moment.,"Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!"
That's great.,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.","So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
"Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?",Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?,"No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you."
"Oh, I hear divorce bells.","Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.","Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?"
No.,"Alright, lady, now give me your purse!","O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet."

"Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!","Yeah, a real pleasure.","Ross, nice to meet you."
Good for you!,"Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!","Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!"
Ouh,So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?,Good for you!
"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up","Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?",Ouh
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.,How do you know a mugger?,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!"
"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I",Seriously?,You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.
"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer","Phoebe, that is awful!","Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I"
She was a drug dealer!,You're mother killed herself!,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer"

Why?,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",Okay
You were?,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",Why?

"No actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street that's where stabby Joe works.","Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",That's it.
"Okay, I think we have a problem here.","No actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street that's where stabby Joe works.","Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?"
"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.",What?,"Okay, I think we have a problem here."
"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.",Yeah?,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics."
"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",So?,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat."

"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid","Oh  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene","Nothing, I really wanna know."
"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.,"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid"
"Yes, it was.","No, it wasn't.","You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl."
"Gimme your money, punk!","No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old","Yes, it was."
"I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!","Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you you mugged me?","Gimme your money, punk!"
"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say",It's not the best!,"I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!"
Really? Even more humiliating than,There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say"
"Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?",The cold weather hurts my hip!,See all of you tomorrow.

"Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.",You really thought Science Boy was worth saving!,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day."
You're welcome. And thank you for Science Boy. I learned a lot from him,"Still this is amazing Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.","Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here."
Why??,I'm gonna go.,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.,Why??
I want you to stay.,I put that tube top on as a joke.,"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."

"Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say Hell yeah!","No, no!

"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.",What are you talking about?,Don't you mean..groomy?
China patterns!!!!!,"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.",What are you talking about?
Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.,"Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little groomy joke.","Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy."
Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.,"I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?",Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
What do you mean?,"Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.",Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Oh. Wow.,"Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.",What do you mean?
Was it really that bad?,"It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.",Oh. Wow.
"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.",At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....,Was it really that bad?
But it's just...,Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!,"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean."
Oh!,"Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.",But it's just...
No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!,I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.,Oh!
Yeah I get that.,"Trust me, I will never...",No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!

Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.,Why?,No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Never.,Never?,Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!","wow, are you still going to move in with him?",Never.
That's not how you really feel is it?,"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.","I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!"
Seriously? You divorce-o?,"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.",That's not how you really feel is it?
It's ok that's how you feel.,"If you have to call me name, I prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",Seriously? You divorce-o?
I do love Mike.,But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.,It's ok that's how you feel.

What do you mean?,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.","Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you."
They are awfully boxy...,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?",What do you mean?
Uh huh.,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.,They are awfully boxy...
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?,"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.","Hey uh, where do you guys want this?"
Right. Except that I do want to get married.,No but... You don't want to get married either right?,Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Someday.,You wanna get married?,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.,Aaaaand....... hernia.,Someday.
"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?,I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.

Are you gonna change yours?,Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.,"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,No.,Are you gonna change yours?
I don't want it to end either.,But I don't want this to end.,Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Yeah.,I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.,I don't want it to end either.
Hi.,Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?,Hi.
"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...","Oh, I'm so sorry!","Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!"
"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",You're not gonna need my help?,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this..."
"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.","Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth","Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.","Ok, you got it!","Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
That was a test and you just failed.,Really? If that's what you want...,"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."
"God, I wish Mike were here.","You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.","What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Here.,"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.","I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
Okay,And now your cell.,Here.
Yes.,This is your cellphone?,Okay
"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",This is your current cellphone?,Yes.
You can't have it.,"No, no! Give it to me!","Phoebe, where's your purse?"

Oh yeah.,I'll go in there.,No
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,Haha!,Phoebe come here
"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",Haha!,You're not the same!
Those are my shoes.,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.","You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.","Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",Those are my shoes.
I ordered Chinese food.,Who's that?,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,I ordered Chinese food.,Who's that?
"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",Phoebe!,Phoebe called me.
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him."
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.","Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!"
Sit down.,"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend .",Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
"Thanks, you look good too.",You look really beautiful.,I've been pretty good!
So how's the piano playing going?,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,"Thanks, you look good too."
I've missed you too.,Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.,So how's the piano playing going?
"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?","I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.","Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it."
What?,"Kiss him, you fool!!","It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped."
"Oh, I missed you so much!",Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,What?
Who is this?,"Oh, crap!",I knew you'd be here!
Hey will you get me tickets too?,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!","Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars."
You don't wanna win the lottery?,No thanks!,yeah thats a great idea!
"Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!","Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.","Well, there's two spots left right?"
"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!","Alright, who wants to do it?",A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
I hope I win!,I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands."
"One, two, three!","Please, just do it!",I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Get a room!,"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here","Because I know that you think the lottery is boohaki but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
"Oooh, I like that, daddy","Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me Daddy too.",I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
"Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,"Oooh, I like that, daddy"
"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?","I'm sorry, idea time is over.","Ooh, I have another idea!"
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.,"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.","Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together","Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.","Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
OOOOOHHHHH!,Oh!,"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!"
"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .","No, no!","Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
Don't come any closer!,NO!!,"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! ."

"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",Money!  Friends...,Friends!
"Ok, good!  I think I broke your bowl.",Monica!,They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
"What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.","Go, go, go!!","Ok, good!  I think I broke your bowl."
"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?","Phoebe, we lost half of them.","What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun."
"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...,"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?"
"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.,"Ok, here we go!"
"Guys, the drawing is about to start!","No, she was just much better at job than me!","Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"

"I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!","Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.","I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!"
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.,"So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your 3?","I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!"
I beg to differ .,"Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.",I guess if everybody else is...
"Seriously, stop staring at her.","Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won 10,000 .",I beg to differ .
Hey!,Hey!,"Yeah, that was an awesome day!"

My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?,"Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...","Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back ."
Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,"Ok, we're still on that."

Yes!,Is it ok if I hug you now?,"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!"

"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.","Duh, you think?","Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time."
"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?","I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?","Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off."
"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",My name is Precious.,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?"
"Well, I don't...",I just can't believe this... Why?,"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.","Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?","Well, I don't..."
"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.","I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?","Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
"Okay, not a fan of the tough love.","Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.","I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?"
"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love."
"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me..."
You're welcome!,"Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.","Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect."
Hey guys!,There's a hair in my coffee.,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",Hey.,Hey guys!
"Hey, what's all this stuff?",That's sweet. Drink your hair.,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say triplets, I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!","Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.","Hey, what's all this stuff?"
"Oh, how does it work?",That's not really how it works.,"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",I don't know!,"Oh, how does it work?"
Hey!,That's not what we talked about!!,"Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules."
Good to see you.,Hey.,Hey!
"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink."
"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.","Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.","Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels."
"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",Yeah.,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute."
"That's a, that's a long time.",I haven't slept in four years!,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing.."
"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.","You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!","That's a, that's a long time."
What?,"Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.","Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area."
"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!","No, I can't.",What?
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?,"Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.","Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!"
"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",That is gonna hurt tomorrow!,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
Insane.,"No, of course we're not.","Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?"
"Alice would never go for it, right?",I know.,Insane.
"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?","Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.","Alice would never go for it, right?"
Frank Jr.Jr.?,Huh.,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?"
Uh-huh.,"Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.",Frank Jr.Jr.?
"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?","What's green and says hey, I'm a frog? A talking frog!  Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.",Uh-huh.
"Alright, so that leaves Chandler.","Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.","Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?"
"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.","Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..","Alright, so that leaves Chandler."
"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.","Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.","Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids."
"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",How about tomorrow?,"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there."
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.,You'd do that for us?,"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together."
Hey.,"Hey, Phoebs",And we're okay?
"Still, he had to find out sometime.",What?,"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
Hey!,Thanks.,There. Here's their card.
"Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.",Hey Phoebe!,Hey Pheebs!
"You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?  Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile! If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!","Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?",Chandler gets pedicures!
"Oh, I know! Oh...I slept with Billy Joel. All right, who hasn't?","I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.","You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?  Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile! If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!","Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!","Oh, I know! Oh...I slept with Billy Joel. All right, who hasn't?"
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!,What?,"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.","No, no, dont get it. Let the machine pick up.","Uh, was that good for you?"
"Oh, youre right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!",It could be Amanda!,"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again."
"Ok, dont hold thy breath!","Lets see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.",You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
"Why, why, why didnt you just say no!","Hi Amanda! Actually now... its... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night?  Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!",I get pedicures!
"Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!","Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldnt say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!","Why, why, why didnt you just say no!"
I did!,And you would?,"Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!"
Hey!,Hey Phoebe!,"Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!"
No.,Is Amanda here yet?,Hey!
"Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?","Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.",No.
"Are you kidding, I love it!","Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?","Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?"
Hi!,"Are you kidding, I love it!","Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?"
Musty!,It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!,Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Well...kinda.,You were going to cut me out?,calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
"Yeah well, in America you're just an ass.",Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!,Oh My God!
Oh my God. Was Mike with him?,"Yeah well, in America you're just an ass.",Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?","If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!",We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
"Please, Monica? In the hall?","Wow, my flat is twice this size!",I have nothing to say to you.
"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.","I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?","Well, aren't you a treat."
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!,I'm still all those things!,"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.",I am scrappy.,You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.",It's because I'm scrappy.,"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
"Yeah, I guess you're right.","Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.",I won't know what I would do without you.
"Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!","You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.","Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!"
Hi!,Hey guys!,"Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!"
"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!","Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.","Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video."
"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",Yeah!,"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!"
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,We were supposed to bring presents?,I'd love to! Yeah!
"Joey, it's a birthday party.","Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
So youre gonna... hit on her?,"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Oh!,"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",So youre gonna... hit on her?
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",Oh!
Separate performances.,Actually we prepared performances.,What did you get her?
"Sure, yeah!","Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",But equally real!
Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?,"Oh, great!","All right, lets get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us."
"Thats right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For theres no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!","Oh, Phoebe, Im sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",Amazing... amazing.
"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading  Finding your G-spot.",Is that it?,"Thats right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For theres no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!"
oh! Now its a party!,"Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God! They put my babys face on a penis!","Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?"
"And you know, I have a massage client soon.","Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.","We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday."
"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.","No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.",Was that Emma? Is she up?
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!,"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!",To the bathroom!
"No, it did not.","Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!

"Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!",A monologue? I don't have..  Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!,Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!","Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!","Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!"
"No, lets just draw straws.","Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?","Ok, ten."
Yeah!! Let's do that!,"Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!",Right.

I'm too excited!,Thats a bear.,Ok! I want the dolphin!
Go! Go!,"Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!","Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!"
Good job Alan!,Way to go robot!,I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?

"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?",I wasn't. Let's get going!,I was kidding.
"Oh good, I didn't miss the party.","No, not yet.","Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?"
"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",What about your massage client?,"Oh good, I didn't miss the party."
"Hey, you made it into a bunny.","Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",What's wrong? Are you okay?

"Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?,YEAH!

"Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Cant believe it's been a whole year!","Ok, lets keep talking.",Im gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.

"Well, thats what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!","Oh, that is so tacky.","We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing..."
"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I dont think hes ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!","Well, do you wanna marry him?","Phoebe, thats huge!"
"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?","Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?
"Well, do you think I should propose?",Thank you.,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!,I think it could be kind of great!
"Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?","What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!","How about at a game, on the big screen?"

"Hey, hey!  Boo us? Boo you!",That's not very enlightened!,Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
"That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.","Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.",Did you just say Emma?
"I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

So what did you two do about it?,"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.","It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!"
"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?","Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
"Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",Are you serious?,"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?"
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,May I help you?,"Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!"
"Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one","Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.",Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.,"Well, this is very generous!","Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one"
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.,Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.,And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.,Not necessary.,"Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter."
"Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!","Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.",And X is spelled uhm... Mike Hannigan.

Mhm... it's moist.,"Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.","Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!"

"Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I wont be needing a veil, I actually wont be wearing a dress at all!","Were waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, Im glad youre here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I dont know if you wanna use it, but","Hello, is this the creepy residence?"
"No, no, no, were not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,"Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I wont be needing a veil, I actually wont be wearing a dress at all!"
"We, you know, were different! We dont care about having a huge party.  All right, well, who cares, I dont need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",Thats crazy! . I am sorry. I just cant imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,"No, no, no, were not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity."

"Its ok, its ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding","Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!",City Hall.
"Well, Ill just ask for it back!",But you already gave all your money to charity!,Yay!
"Its for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.",Were seriously asking for our money back?,Ok!  Ow!
"Gay, go.",Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I dont think that thats ever happened before.,"Its for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting."
"The donation we made earlier, we k, we w, we want it back.","Oh my God, I love your shirt!","Gay, go."
"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didnt want, but it turns out we do.",Excuse me?,"The donation we made earlier, we k, we w, we want it back."
"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",Yeah! This feels really good.,So youre asking us to refund your donation to the children?
"Hey, thats not fair! A persons wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didnt have a graduation party! And I didnt go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.","Hey, its not my business,  besides its probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing","I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me."
Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.,"You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about",You can't make this stuff up!
"Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up.  thinks for a few","Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.",Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
"Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.","No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.","Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up.  thinks for a few"
"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot","Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.","Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted."
We're back!,LAURA!,"Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents."
"Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.","No, no, we're here to give the money back.","Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM."
"Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!","Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.","No, no, we're here to give the money back."
But... but... but we're giving you this!,"On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.",What?
"Well, this is very generous!",Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.,But... but... but we're giving you this!
"Oh, is that you?","Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.","Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation."

You'd be in competition... with yourself.","What? You are way off, lady!","Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch."

Hello Michelin Man.","Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!","We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!"
"But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!","Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet.

"We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.",I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.,"Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?"
"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.","Well, let's just go in there and face them.","Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad."
"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .",That's fire. Beats everything.,What is that?

"Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.","Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!",It's really starting to hurt.

"Oh, right! Your adoption interview!","We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.",Hey!

"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.","Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?","Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge."
Hey. Everything ok?,Hey Phoebe.,Hell be fine.

Im guessing she does.,Theres a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didnt even be put up for it! Shed better have a good reason.,Estelle? Why?
"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.","Well  Im wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.",Im guessing she does.
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.,Ok. Why?,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her."
"Joey, its Estelle.",Hello?,I love that saying!
"Its a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, Im sure youre wondering why I didnt get you an audition for that TV movie.",I was just gonna call you! Thats weird.,"Joey, its Estelle."
I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!,"Yeah, actually I am!","Its a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, Im sure youre wondering why I didnt get you an audition for that TV movie."
"Dont take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?","Thats it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
What are you saying?,"No, no, look. All Im saying is that youre my agent, ok? And youre not getting me into any auditions and Im tired of it.","Dont take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?"
"Man, tough week for Estelle!",Im saying that .,What are you saying?

"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you","I dont know. Shes got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And Im guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know shes not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. Im gonna call her and hire her again.","No, that wouldnt kill her. Ordinary embolism might."
Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.,Why?,"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you"
"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?",You blow me away.,Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.",Estelle?,Oh my God.  Hello?
"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...","Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?","Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me."
"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.","No, no, no!  Don't drop by, don't drop by!","Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
"It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.","Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?","Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay."

"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but I do have something for you.","Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.","Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching."
"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!","Oh, oh. . What is this?","Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but I do have something for you."

"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.",Are you kidding? Oh my God...,She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Yeah!,Pheebs!,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room."
"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.",I think these are yours.,Yeah!
Where do you think Mike really is?,Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?,Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.",God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.","No, I don't think so.","All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?"
"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.",Mine was a humdinger,Yeah. Mine too.
Tell me about it.,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.,I hope Ross isn't too upset.
"All right, I think I'm gonna head out.","Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.",Tell me about it.
"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.","Uh, where do you think you're going?","All right, I think I'm gonna head out."
Yeah.,"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
How was your night?,"Come on here, have a seat.",Hey!
"Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.",Oh my God!,"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor."

"All right, here it goes...","Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.","All right, ready?"
Morning.,"One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.","Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both."
What's that?,Hey!,Morning.
It's a baby chick and duck!,It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.,What's that?
I did not see that coming.,Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.,It's a baby chick and duck!
Yes.,"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.",I did not see that coming.
"That is the rule, though.",Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.,Yes.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!,"That is the rule, though.",Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.

Yay!,Shhh!,YAY!
"Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!  Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes...","Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.","So, so is she still going to Paris?"

"Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.",Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...,"Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?"
"Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!",Nothing! What do you say to that?,Oh my God! What did you say?
"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.","Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.",What?
"I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam...",You really think so?,"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go."

"How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.",Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.,Why not?
"Uh, Joe?","Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...","Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is."
"No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!","Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.",Damn it!

Hurry!,"Okay, guys, wish me luck.","You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport."

Okay!,"Alright, alright, let's do this!","That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car."

"Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!",What? We're never gonna make it!,You have to get a ticket to get past security.
