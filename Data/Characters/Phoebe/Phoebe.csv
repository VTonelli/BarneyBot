"We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.",I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.,"Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?",Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!,Ross' shirt is torn.,Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!

"Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.",Sorry!,"Ewww, is that what that is?",That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.,Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.,It's too late for apologies.
I'll pull you through.,No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.,"Joey, that is not gonna work.",Oh-oh! I'm stuck!,Ha!,"Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!"
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.,I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.,Oh!,I left them at the park.,I gave them to Joey.,I lent them to Ross.
"Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.","Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!",It's really starting to hurt.,"Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.",Nice!,I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
