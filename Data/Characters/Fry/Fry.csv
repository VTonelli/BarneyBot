"My God, a million years!",Yep. It's December 31st 2999.,Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
"Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.",I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.,"My God, a million years!"
That's great! What's the little guy's name?,...great great great great great nephew.,Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great great great great great great great...

Help! What's happening?,"C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!","Great choice! Bring it on, baby!"
Why would a robot need to drink?,"Well that's your job, whether you like it or not and it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not - which I do - very much! Now get to work! Life is good!","Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him."
Really? What do you do Bender?,"I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.",Why would a robot need to drink?
You any good at it?,"I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.",Really? What do you do Bender?
What?,"You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.",You any good at it?

"Yeah, ever since I was six.",You really want a robot for a friend?,Wait! You're the only friend I have!

"Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.","Oh, we're trapped!","Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do."
Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?,"Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?","Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars."
"C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals...and animal robots.",Open up!,I'll have to check my program...yep.
"Come on, Bender! You can do it.","You're full of crap, Fry! You make a persuasive argument, Fry.","C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals...and animal robots."
Yes!,Can't...I...can't...do...it!,"Come on, Bender! You can do it."
I don't know how you did that.,"You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!",Yes!
Good Lord! What is this?,Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.,"No, thanks."

"No, you don't. I've got no home, no family...","Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.","Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already."
...My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.,No friends.,"No, you don't. I've got no home, no family..."
"Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. Your chip. What are you doing?",I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.,...My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
Why?,Quitting.,"Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. Your chip. What are you doing?"
What is the matter with you?,Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.,Why?
Correction. We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.,I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.,"Sorry. Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink."
I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.,Who are you?,"Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!"
Whoa! A real live spaceship!,Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.,"Oh, my, no."
No!,"Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.",I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
I'll get us out of here.,I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.,Can't we get away in the ship?
Blast-off!,One!,Two.
"So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.",I can't see nothing. Pretty though!,Fire! Fire!
Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!,Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?,New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?,"Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it I saved the chips from my previous crew.","Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips."
Cool! What's my job gonna be?,If by that you mean transporting cargo then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.,This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
"So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?",You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.,Cool! What's my job gonna be?

Wow!,As new employees I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Superbowl.,"By Ken Keeler Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
Are there really giant birds like that?,Planet Express: Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.,"Thank you, sir!"
I'm never going to get used to the 31st century. Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?,"No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.",Are there really giant birds like that?
Hi -- eurgh!,"Now Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little unusual. He wears sandals!",Sign the paper!
I only have one.,Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain. No no no no no not that mouth!,You'll be fine.
"Uh, is there a human doctor around?",Really?,I only have one.
"Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?",A little.,Ow!
Last time I checked.,"Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?","As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me."
"Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!","Ah, to be young again. And also a robot! Now as I recall you youngsters have a package to deliver.","Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. La la la look at my head. It's all painted look at my head! I got a big old head, hey! Ho! Alright, show's over, I'm tired."
So where are we going anyway?,"Nice catch, idiot!","Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!"
The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!,Nowhere special. The moon.,So where are we going anyway?
Can I do the countdown?,Nothing will go wrong. If something goes wrong bring back the blood.,Well...I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screwups until at least my second day as captain.
Ten......nine --,"Huh? Oh sure, knock yourself out.",Can I do the countdown?
"Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!",OK we're here!,Ten......nine --
That's one small step for Fry --,"Relax, its open till 9.","Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!"
"Wow! Um, can I have cuts?",And one giant line for admission!,That's one small step for Fry --
You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!,Hmm -- No!,"Wow! Um, can I have cuts?"
"Lets go, already!",Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.,You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.,"Fry, we have a crate to deliver.","Lets go, already!"
I had more but you go ahead.,"OK, if everyone's finished being stupid",Too much work. Lets burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
But I've never been to the moon before.,We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.,I had more but you go ahead.
Clear!,Clear?,"Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir, um, ma'am!"
Ready!,Ready to hoist?,Clear!
My first space delivery.,Ow!,Ready!
"Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.",My first space delivery.,Ow!
"But you are lazy, right?","Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.","Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth."
"Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.",Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.,Who buys this trash?
So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?,"Get it off! Get it off! Get it -- uh oh! How many roads must a man walk down, before you... Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!","Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets."
This is weak!,Because it's a little meteor!,Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
"I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth. That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!","What's wrong, Fry?",Address all complaints to the Monsanto Corporation.
I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!,Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.,Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.,Next year in Jerusalem!,I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
"That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.","Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!","One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!"
I do.,"No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon...",What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
That's not how it happened.,...and sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon...,"We carry a harpoon,"
This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.,"Oh, really? I don't see you with a fungineering degree! pgt;",That's not how it happened.
Not for long!,"Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.",This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
Agreed. Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!,"OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?",Ooh aah! I died doin' what I loved.
Yee-haw!,We're whalers on the -,Agreed. Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!
No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?,Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.,Yee-haw!
Well I'm feelin' lucky! Uh... I'm ready to go back now.,That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!,No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
"We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! Help me, Leela! You did it! We're safe!",Well I'm feelin' lucky! Uh... I'm ready to go back now.,That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
It's every man for himself.,No. Now we're gonna die.,"We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! Help me, Leela! You did it! We're safe!"
"I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.","Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!","Here, let me do it. Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged! That's her, officers! Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!"
"No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.","Trespassers, eh?",Thank God!
I guess we could do chores for a few hours.,"Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.",Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
Fahrenheit or Celsius?,Yup. Drops down to -173!,"Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon."
Robot daughters?,"First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you aint goin' nowhere til sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?",Fahrenheit or Celsius?
Whoa!,Yoo-hoo.,And the Crushinator.
"And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and, and these fellas.","I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.",Whoa!
I guess I can't.,"Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's a boring dried up wasteland. And the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?","And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and, and these fellas."
"Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?",Bender?,He'll never find me in here.
It's too low.,"Yes, Pa.","Oh, no you don't! C'mere Crushinator."
"Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!","No, Pa. I love him.","God darn, it Crushinator, jump!"
Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!,We can't outrun it forever.,"Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas."
"It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint! Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?","Quick, get in.",Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
"Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.",Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.,"Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing."
I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.,"That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.","Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here."
"The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.",A week would be a little much.,I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
It's Amy! We're saved!,"Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.","Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before."
"Well, close enough!","So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?","She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,"
I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.,"Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.",Hey!
And great lift!,What the hell are you doing?! You're getting a huge dose of radiation!,"Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps. Now......as this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry? Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus -"
"Hey, when you look this good, you don't have to know anything.",Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?,And great lift!
"Hey, Professor, great jerky!","Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zubin 5 over 29 million years ago.",He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
"Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.",And Bigfoot is down!,Bachelor chow: Now with flavour!
"Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.","Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.","Oh, Calculon! It fits! Then you must know that I'm --"
I know but I forgive you.,"Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.","Hey, All My Circuits! Move over. Ahh!"
Uh-huh.,"No, Fry, by close quarters I mean this office...",I know but I forgive you.
Right.,...and by people I mean you!,Uh-huh.
Leela! We're trying to watch TV.,And by inconsiderate I mean --,Right.
"So, who's that weird-looking guy?","Yeah, would you kindly shut your noise hole?",Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
What's he do?,That's a human.,"So, who's that weird-looking guy?"
Boring!,"Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.",What's he do?
"Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?","That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.",Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?,"Cheer up, meatbag, you've barely touched your amoeba.",We'll bill you for the couch.
What are the cigars for?,"Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.",It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.,They make me look cool.,What are the cigars for?
I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?,"Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?",I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?,"Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?",I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
"Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.",Here we are. Your new home.,"Nah, I've always wanted a pet."
It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.,"Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.","Come on in, I'll give you the tour!"
"Wait, Bender. Bender?","Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.",It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.

"Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?",I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.,"Bender, wake up!"
Bathroom.,Bath what?,"Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?"
Bathroom!,What room?,Bathroom.
"Ah, never mind!",What what?,Bathroom!
"Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? Now you're OK.",What happened to you?,"Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior, beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot."
Is that an invitation?,Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.,"Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? Now you're OK."
"Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.","Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.",Is that an invitation?
"Well, I'm moving out!","Hey, there's my little space heater.","Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him."
"I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.",What?!,"Well, I'm moving out!"
"Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.",Wow! Now this is fantastic!,"Excuse me, I gotta go change a lightbulb."
"Well, I give up. What's the catch?","Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.",Wow! Now this is fantastic!
Not one place even remotely liveable.,"Oh, no catch. Although we are technically in New Jersey.","Well, I give up. What's the catch?"

It's out again.,"To reiterate, my terrible secret is","Come back, Bender, its working!"
It's back on!,What? That's the last straw!,It's out again.
"It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.","Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?","Well, you heard the mob!"
"Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?",Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!,"It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here."
"Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?",I don't understand.,"Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?"
I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.,"But, then we wouldn't be roommates.","Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?"
"Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.",No he can't.,I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
"Hey, thanks for coming.","I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.",Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
"Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.","Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?","Hey, thanks for coming."
Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.,Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.,"Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs."
Same thing.,"Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.",Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
What up?,I promise nothing!,Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.,I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.,What up?
Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.,Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.,Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
"Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.","He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.",Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
"Oh, stupid TV! Bender! You're blind stinking sober!","Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.","He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him."
Don't do it!,That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!,"Oh, stupid TV! Bender! You're blind stinking sober!"
Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!,Bender! Stop!,"I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again."
"Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?","No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.",Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.,"Fry, don't help him mutilate himself.","Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?"
"Hey, it works! The static's gone.",I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.,But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
She's right.,You guys could learn a lesson from those two.,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.","You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.",She's right.
What's wrong?,"Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be......Oh, never mind!","Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
"Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?",Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.,What's wrong?
It's good to be home.,"This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.",You call that an antenna?
"So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?","It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.",It's good to be home.
"This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?",There's a window in the closet.,"So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?"
What was wrong with your date last night?,"You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded. Ew!",You like the meal just wait until you try these after dinner mints.
"Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.",You're too picky.,I don't know. Something I couldnt quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
Why's everyone wearing those rings?,"Oh, wow, it's totally retro.","Hmm, I'll pick!"
I think they look cool.,Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!,Why's everyone wearing those rings?
No way! We've got so much in common.,You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.,Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
"Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.",We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?,No way! We've got so much in common.
"Psst, I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.",Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.,You're impossible.
A delivery?,"Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.",Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.,Why two? Oh!,So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
"Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.","That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.",I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?,"Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.","You! Aren't you getting this? We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, ham, sundae bar."
Who's the Zapp Brannigan?,Uh-huh!,Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
Wow!,They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian system from a horde of rampaging Killbots.,"Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces. What?"
Leela's got a boyfriend!,He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order Of Planets.,"A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!"
I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something something system.,"But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.",You don't mean that!
Wow! I never would have thought of that!,The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.,I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something something system.
What just happened?,I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!,Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?,He's throwing us in prison.,What just happened?
"We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.",Erotic!,What?
No good! It's full of steam!,"Hey, yeah!","We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe."
You wanna try escaping again?,"Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that bad.",I'm just so lonely!
"Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.","Nah, I'm comfy.",You wanna try escaping again?
Really? Why?,The fatso says you're free to go.,I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
What does that mean?,Why indeed.,Really? Why?
"Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.",So you're saying we can cook him?,"Hello there. Hmm, he doesn't seem to be on the checklist."
Where'd they all go?,Hey. What the?,Good. That's the last species.
I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!,Nibbler!,Where'd they all go?
The planet's kerploding!,"Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?",He's pending for a bending.
"Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.","Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.","Prepare for lift-off. We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left."
What? What are you talking about?,"No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!","Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby."
"How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!","So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. Oh, my God!",Nothing. We just talked.
No!,That's enough. Don't you think I feel bad enough already?,"How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!"
"Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?",And which one rocked your world?,"I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!"
Pew!,What the hell was that?,Can do!
We're heroes!,So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!,We made it! And some of the animals survived.

What's wrong?,"Oh, dear Lord!",Zero! And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth. Is it a human child? I wish!
"Well, aren't they?",Admit it: You all think robots are just machines built by humans to make their lives easier.,See you at the office!
Why is that great news?,"Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9, a world where humans are killed on sight.",I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
Really? Which one?,Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.,This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
"Man, that one was a blast!","Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was Robomadom and before that Robonza.",Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?,"Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!","Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last stinking one of you for the rest of your lives."
Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.,No. It's inhabited by robots!,So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
"Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.","Hmm, he seems pretty angry.",I'll try to keep that in mind!
"Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.",There! This oughta show that stupid robot we care about him.,Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
"Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him.","I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and -- oh, no! Oh, no!","Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery."
W-what are we gonna do?,"No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight.","Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him."
"I am fully operational, captain.","OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.",I don't know! I don't know! It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?,"We'll have to walk like robots, talk like robots and, if necessary, solve complex differential equations like robots.","I am fully operational, captain."
"Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes.","Fry, first of all this is serious. And second of all:",I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?

We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.,Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?,Psst! Bender!
We're rescuing you.,What for?,Good for you. Now let's all get back to the ship.

10.77. Same as my PIN number.,So. What do I owe you?,"Uh, cheese and a -- That was quick!"
"Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.",Ow!,Ow!
"No, that's not true!",We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.,Since when do you care about us?
"Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?",FRY,Wheee!
3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful! Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?,"Uh, 3000.","Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?"
"Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...","Uh, check bounced. We're taking it all back.",3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful! Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!,"Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...",You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
I was robbed. They got everything except these.,You did? What happened?,Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.,I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet young man by buying his anchovies.,It's Mom.
"You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.","What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?",Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
What a nice lady!,"Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! Dumb ass!","You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like."
"OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.",What a nice lady!,"Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! Dumb ass!"
"Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.","I don't know, I've had cow. Ew! Gross!","OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted."
There aren't any more. And there never will be.,That stench. That heavenly stench! More!,"Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you."
"Hey, what you watching?","Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug. Now while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel - bam!",Ah! Aww!
"Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.","Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.",Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
You're gonna be the ship's cook?,Hmm.,I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
Bam!,"Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.","I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste."
So this is Little Neptune?,Bam!,"Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top."
Ooh! What's this?,Psst! You want to buy organ? Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!,"Come on, man, don't hold out on me like this!"
Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.,Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!,Ooh! What's this?
"Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?","Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X.",Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
"I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?","Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.","Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?"
See?,Word!,"I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?"
Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!,See?,Word!
"Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.","Hey, have you seen Fry?","Yeah, yeah, either one's fine."
Can't imagine why I would.,"Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?","Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills."
"I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?",What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.,Thank you!
Hey Bender how's dinner coming?,"Off you go, pleasant trip.","Uh, Professor..."
"Yeah, OK.","Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?",Now for a dash of salt! Uh-oh!
That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl of salt!,"Oh, dear God!",Alright.
My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.,It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.,"Bender, is this salt water?"
Ow!,"OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.","Uh-oh, I shouldn't have had seconds."
"Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.","Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.",Ow!
"Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already! Ah!","Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.","Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back."
Hello? Anybody home?,"Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already! Ah!","Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing."
No! It wasn't me!,You drank our Emperor!,The royal bottle is empty!
I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.,You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him.,No! It wasn't me!
It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.,"So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!",Hail! Hail! Hail!
You might.,"Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?",It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
I gotta go with Bender.,"You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.",I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
"Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.","That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.","Yes! In your face, Gorgak!"
"Hey, thanks! Wow! This got here just in time.","Your Highness, a package came for you.","Stay the course, pal!"
"Umm, how about that one?",This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.,"Hey, thanks! Wow! This got here just in time."
"On second thought, I'll take that one.",Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!,"Umm, how about that one?"
"You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela, we all know who you're talking about...uh, me, right?","Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?","Hey, whatever you say, I'm not here to pass judgement."
"There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?",Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.,A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
Will there be cake?,Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.,"There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?"
There you go.,Hi!,"Yeah, I know."
"Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!","So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... Right? Am I right?","And now, get ready to laugh til your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!"
So?,"You see Emperor Plon here? He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.","Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger."
"80,000 years?",Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?,So?
Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.,No. One week.,"80,000 years?"
Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?,Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
"Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.","You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.",Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
"Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.","No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.","Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself."
"Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?",That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?,"Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later."
Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.,I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.,"Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?"
I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. Quit it!,"That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.",Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.
What up?,"People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor!",I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. Quit it!
"Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...",Stick to the oath.,What up?
"...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity - uh, integrity!","Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...",Stick to the oath.
My tummy hurts!,Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!,The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
Ow!,"Shut up, you!","They're over here, they're running up the stairs."
What am I gonna do?,Fry must die so that Bont may live.,Let us in!
But won't that crush my bones?,"Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.",We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?,Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.,"Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?"
That's a great idea! Crying.,What about crying?,Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.,"Oh, dear!","Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel."
What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.,"I'll make you cry, buddy! You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.",It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
These things happen.,Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.,What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
Phew! That's a load off my mind.,"OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!",These things happen.
She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.,"Cram it, lobster! That is a good idea. I'll go call her.","Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help."
What the hell is that?,I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.,Is she coming?
This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.,Of course! Why didn't I think of that!,"Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains."
I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.,"Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.",Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
Is she alright?,You do? Hmm.,I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
No. No!,"I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.",Is she alright?
This can't be happening.,"They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.","What are you talking about, Bender? She's al -- Oh!"
"All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. I wish I had died instead of her.","It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.",This can't be happening.
Leela! You're alive!,What are you talking about?,"All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. I wish I had died instead of her."
"Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. Ow! What was that for? Hey, come on! That hurt!","Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.",I'll handle this!
"Oh, now I understand.","I know. Amy, get the bottle.","Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. Ow! What was that for? Hey, come on! That hurt!"
"Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!",Come on. Everybody help out Fry.,"Oh, now I understand."
"Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?","OK, it's your turn.",Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
"Oh, you're welcome.",I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.,"Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?"
Wow! I love symposia.,Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.,Why can't they go today?
Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?,Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.,Does it really work?
Who's the gross nerd?,"Oh, my, yes.",Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
Who's that jerk?,"Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.",You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
"Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.","Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse SCUBA Suit. Observe! Fetch! Now, sit! I said sit! Bad fish!",More wine!
"No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!",Yep!,Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
Did you build the Smellescope?,Eureka!,"By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!"
Smells like strawberries.,"No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.",Did you build the Smellescope?
"Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.",Exactly! And now Saturn.,Smells like strawberries.
Oh. What's it called now?,"I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.",I don't get it.
"No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here! Hmm. Hmm.","Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.",Oh. What's it called now?
So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city? What the heck is it?,"Well, lets get looting!","Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory. My God! Whatever it is it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours."
Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.,"New York City: the year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage. The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge. The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it. Not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain ",Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
"Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?","Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?","So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage."
The future is disgusting.,And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches. Nothing just gets thrown away.,Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
"Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.",Typical 20th century attitude.,The future is disgusting.
"Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.",Those things are all from the 19th century.,"Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin."
"Hmm, sporty!",Odour at magnitude 8. Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31. We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.,"Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return."
Wow!,"Hmm, sporty!",Odour at magnitude 8. Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31. We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. Look! A real Beanie Baby. Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate! Some Bart Simpson dolls!,Look at all this filth.,Wow!
This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.,"Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!",OK Mmm! Shorts!
"Alright, let's get to work.",This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.,"Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!"
We're gonna die! Right?,"That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.",There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
We're saved!,"OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.","Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!"
"No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can. Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.","Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.

What's happening? I-I feel weird!,We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!,Electrical. Anyway it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.,But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.,"In fact, that's why we loved you."
Great he's whacked out on electricity again.,"Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day! Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?",This is a witch hunt!

Does that mean we can eat now?,...0010110012. Amen.,Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...
"Oh, uh, but I don't want to.","Yes. But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!",Does that mean we can eat now?

We've got to get the old Bender back.,If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.,Amen.
"Uh, this.",I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?,And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called sleaze.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some, exotic dancing!",Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.,"Uh, here."

Maybe he likes it here in hell.,It's up to us to rescue him.,I don't feel well.
Maybe he's back at the motel.,It's us who tempted him to sin.,Maybe he likes it here in hell.

"No, do you?",Do you know how to play the fiddle?,Well it's mostly for show.
Run!,Time for the drum solo!,Your turn. Ha!
Good old Bender!,I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?,"Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that."
Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!,That was the worst delivery ever.,"By Eric Horsted Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"

"Man, first class seems nice!","Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife LaBarbara have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.","Come on, where is it? Ohh!"
Well at least we get a window!,This is it.,Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc ... all alone ... on a romatic cruise.,I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.,"Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!"

"Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.",What? No. No! Of course not!,"I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?"
"Go, Professor!",Aha!,You got it!
"Thank you, sir.","I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.",You do? Really?
"Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.","As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.","Thank you, sir."
Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.,What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.,"Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete."

Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.",Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
"Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.",I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.,"Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?"
"I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.","Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.","Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you."

"Goodbye, Bender.",I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.,Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
Look!,"Well, its not me!",Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
"Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?","But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.",She's gone.

Is it dangerous?,"I don't care, they all pay the same.",In what field?
Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.,"Oh, my, no. Off we go!",Is it dangerous?
Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?,"They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.","Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636."
What was your minor?,"Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.",You went to college?
"I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.","Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!","Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder."
Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!,Keep your hands inside the car at all times.,"Step right up, who wants to learn physics?"
"Oh, yeah? Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.","Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.",Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!
"What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!","That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.",Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
"Aww, thanks for believing in me.",You won't last two weeks.,"What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!"

You know each other?,"Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!","Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species."
Is he genetically engineered?,So what makes Guenter talk?,I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
I understood the word hat!,"You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.","Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation."
You want a banana?,"Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.",I understood the word hat!

I hate that rodent!,"Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.",It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
That'll show him.,"Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.",I hate that rodent!
Now these monkeys I like! What's that? You wanna come out?,Mom? Dad? What are you doing here? This is so humiliating.,"Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you."

Look out! He's got a gun!,You mean peer pressure?,"What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today."
"Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest hardworking people.",Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primative beast.,"Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas."
"Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.",They can't. It's all the hat.,That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
"Thanks, Professor!","Look at him, I'm so proud.",But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
Ow!,Not you.,"Thanks, Professor!"
I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.,I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.,So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
"Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment.",You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?,I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
Wow The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.,Hey!,"Fraternities, on your marks."

No.,"Thank God this log is sturdy. Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us! Stupid monkey.",No! No!

Who's behind does that come from?,Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?,How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
What about me?,"Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!","But, your highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul."
Yes!,You are free to go ...,What about me?
Mmm!,"... if you can resist this concentrated super Slurm! It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon apptit!",Yes!
Here I come. Let me just-- One more taste.,"Fry, untie us, quick!","Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest."
I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.,"Yeah, we're boned.",I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!,What's happening? Just in time!,Hurry!
Say what?,Shh! I want you to take me with you.,Slurms MacKenzie?
But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.,"Go on without me, I'll hold her off.",She's gaining on us.
"Outlaw Slurm? Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ...","Hmm, hiney, you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm.","Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!"
... Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.,"Outlaw Slurm? Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ...","Hmm, hiney, you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm."
"Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.","OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the bad worms, don't you worry.","I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!"
For Slurms!,For Slurms!,For Slurms!
Mmm!,"Hey, that's not that bad.",Whammy-wazzle!
Is it me?,Aww! Somebody likes snouts.,Futurama is brought to you by ... ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
"You alright, Bender?","Ow, my head! My precious head! Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!",Is it me?
"Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?","OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. Now then.",Next time I'm keeping it.
"Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.","Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.","Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?,I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.,"Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
... and you smell like one too!,"What day is today? It's Nibbler's birthday, What a day for a birthday, Let's all have some cake.","Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?,"Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.",I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?,"Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.",Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
Thanks for covering.,Uh ... that's me.,"Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
What's your problem?,A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.,"Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy."
You do?,I miss Nibbler.,What's your problem?
What?,"Uh-oh, jealousy. You think you're so hot!","Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
They're just responding to my personality.,The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!,What?
The spoon's in the foot powder.,I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. A bucket of ...,Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
"Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive in the sewers.","I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.",The spoon's in the foot powder.
Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.,Really?,"Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive in the sewers."
Bender? Bender?!,"Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway? Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!","Hmm, sewers. Thinking, thinking, thinking."
Have you seen my sombrero?,Bender? Bender?!,"Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway? Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!"
"Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.",Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?,Have you seen my sombrero?
"Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!",You're right. I feel terrible.,"Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
God bless America.,"Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American faeces.",There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
"Phew! Uh, ladies first.",God bless America.,"Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American faeces."
"Oh, and the aftertaste!","Phew! Uh, ladies first.",God bless America.
I burned my finger.,What is it?,"Oh, and the aftertaste!"
"Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.","OK, check the guidebook.",I burned my finger.
Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. Or maybe it's whatever that is.,He was so sweet.,He was so cute.
"Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.","It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?",Nibbler?
"OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those people for directions.",Idiot.,Idiot.
I'll take care of this! Back! Back!,Mutants! They're real!,Mutants!
"Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.",Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.,I said harmless not armless.
Daylight and everything.,"No, we're on the top.",Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?,And over here is our church.,Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
"So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?","Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.",Nibbler?
I'll take care of this.,That's El Chupanibre.,Say what?
"Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!",I'm too scared.,"Bender, do something."
Even me?,I can't. I love every living creature.,"Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
Damn.,As a friend.,Even me?
Bender's gonna be killed!,"Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.",Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
Yeah!,You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.,Bender's gonna be killed!
Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.,"Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.",I love you too. Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. Check.,"By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet",FUTURAMA
Good move.,"Hmm. Get him, boys!",Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. Check.
Sorry.,Nope. Watching cartoons.,"Good news, everyone. We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
DOOP? What's that?,It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.,What's the mission?
Uh...,"It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.",DOOP? What's that?
Oh!,Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.,Uh...
"Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!","Alright, but don't run with them.",We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
"So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.","Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.,Big rats there. Me crush with club.,"So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
"Hey, Bender?","Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians. That's an order, soldier.","No, it doesn't."
"You don't have to get so mad, Leela.","Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.",Yeah?
She's really strict.,"So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?","Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy."
"No, she just makes us do work and stuff.",I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?,And mean.
"Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.",They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.,They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
Yeah!,"Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.",I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
"Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.",I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.,"Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
I agree.,"I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh.",Just get to work.
"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.","Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um...OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?","Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
"Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.",This is all Leela's fault.,"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
"Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.","Y'know boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.","Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
Underpants?,Beer?,"Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants."
This is a mutiny.,"But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free! Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!",Underpants?
All hail the new captain.,"You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.",This is a mutiny.
We don't have a brig.,Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.,"On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.,"But, didn't I do a good job?","You got it, genius."
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.","Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.",You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
Ten hundred percent!,To the ends of the universe.,"Take them to the laundry-brig. So, do I have your loyalty, men?"
"Ooh, burn!","Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialed in disgrace.","But, sir, that plan makes no sense."
"This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...",Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.,"Nailed you, buddy!"
"Good, good, then what?","Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape.","What now, chief?"
Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?,"Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board.","Good, good, then what?"
"Leela, we want you to be captain again.",Of course. What do you think I meant by loyalty? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.,Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
We want Leela to be captain again.,Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer? So he's about to kill us?,"Leela, we want you to be captain again."
Absolutely.,"OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?","Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. And Fry."
And warm.,"Oh, man, that crap's heavy.",Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
It's too low.,"Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.",Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.,You did it! You actually did it!,Quick.
"Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.",I-I'll call and tell you about it.,"Come, Kif, we've got work to do."
Please?,No.,"Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
"Aw, man.",No time off.,"Oh, alright."
What do we care? We live in the United States.,"Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.",C-SPAN9 presents: The Thrill Of Politics.
Wow! I have been gone a long time.,The United States is part of the world.,What do we care? We live in the United States.
These are the candidates? They sound like clones. Wait a minute. They are clones!,"Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!",It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say: I'm against those things that everybody hates.
"If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.",And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!,I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. It's not like one vote ever made a difference.,You're not registered?,"If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown."
"Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?","Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register.","The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered."
The less fortunate get all the breaks!,The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.,The very instant I became old.
"What party do you belong to, Bender?",Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.,Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
'Cause you're a robot?,I'm not allowed to vote.,"What party do you belong to, Bender?"
"OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?",We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.,"No, convicted felon."
"Sure, you say that now!",Attach Brain Slugs to them.,"OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?"
Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!,I concur.,"Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?"
"OK then, screw it.","Sorry, not with that attitude.",Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
Alright!,"Welcome aboard, brother!","OK then, screw it."
That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.,You're out.,Alright!
Too bad you can't spend it.,My body's 40 titanium! I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.,What are you talking about?
No.,"Oh, can't I?",Too bad you can't spend it.
"Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?",Bender? What happened to you?,"Hello, peasants."
"This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?","Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.","No, I sold my body."
"Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.",Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.,"This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?"
"Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?",Timber!,"Strike! In your face, Leela! Ow!"
Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.,"Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!","Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?"
I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?,"Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.","Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?"
"Well, you're looking great.","Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.",I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?
Couldn't hurt.,Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.,"Well, you're looking great."
"Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.","I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.","Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore."
"I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but -- ooh!","I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.",Ah. Booze money.
"Bender, what is it?","Ones...zeros...one, one, zero, zero, one --",That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
"It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.","Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.","Bender, what is it?"
"Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!","I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.",You sold my body? To who?!
"Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!","Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?",Don't you have a self-destruct button?
"Yeah, and that electric guitar.",Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.,"That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!"

"No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!",It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.,"Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!"
Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?,I've got a better plan.,"No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!"
"Keep going, we're right behind you.",They give you a discount if you've been here before.,Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
Ooh! Uh-oh!,"OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.","Hey, Betty Friedan. Send a little of that lotion my way!"
"Well, he lost my vote.","Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.",You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
"Hey, I've got one last thought.","Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.","The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body."
What?,No!,The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening...and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?,Get out of town!,What?
Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.,"Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.",I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.

This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.,"Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!","They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree."
Everything's changed.,"There, there.",This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.,Ow!,Xmas tree oh Xmas tree! Bah boo bee boo bah bee boh.
"What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the lonliest person on Earth. Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? Yoiks! What was that about?",Huh? What's this? A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. Instead of Claus he writes Claws! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.,"Hmm. Ah, a picture of my mommy."
My God! Poor Leela.,"Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.",Fluh! She's an orphan.
I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.,"Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well old Bender'll make you laugh. Look at me look! Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!",My God! Poor Leela.

I know about Santa Claus.,Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.,Say what?
Wow! 2801! Anyway...,"Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.",I know about Santa Claus.
There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?,"Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!","Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you."

"Merry Xmas, Leela.",It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But together we're lonely together.,"I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family."
"Oh, boy! It's Santa!",Merry Xmas.,"Merry Xmas, Leela."
Well check it twice!,"Ho, ho, ho! You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.","Oh, boy! It's Santa!"
No! I swear!,But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?,But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!,Get her purse!,"Oh, alright. But just one glass!  from inside  OK, that's enough. I said that's enough!"
"I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!",We're trapped.,You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
"Goodbye, Leela. Hey, look: We're under the mistletoe.","Goodbye, Fry.","I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!"
"Uh, you're present may need some assembly.",Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!,"Goodbye, Leela. Hey, look: We're under the mistletoe."
Help!,"Oh, thank you!",And a slipper on a shoe tree.
Help!,Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. Finally I look as pretty as I feel!,"Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg."
He's gonna blow.,Rudolph's nose!,Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
"Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?","Xmas dinner, everyone.","Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!"
"Look, the food isn't what's important.",You got the toenail! Oh!,"Thank you, sir."
"The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.",I'm so hungry.,"Look, the food isn't what's important."
Santa Claus is gunning you down!,"You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.","You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move."
Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian creamdog that's also self-microwaving!,Robo-Rooter!,... And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
Sack?,"Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.","Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?"
Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!,"Yo, yo, yo! Whassup whassup! Give up the rock!","What up, Dr. Z?"
"Ah, futuristic!","Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam room.",Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
"Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!",You wish!,"Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?"
"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?",Give me that. More weight!,"Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
Maybe he has a parasite.,"Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.","I am normal. Amy, take of these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!"
"No, Amy!",Stop!,I'll do it.
Eck!,It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.,Bleck!
"Oh, baby, I'm there!","...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.",I'll get the water boiling!
"Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!","Fry, do you even understand the word invertebrate?","Oh, baby, I'm there!"
Is that how you say Zoidberg?,See you there Doctor--,"Excellent, excellent!"
Who's the lucky lobsterina?,"I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. If you catch my drift.","You're looking less nuts, crabby."
"You and me both, brother!",Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.,It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?,"No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. They don't!","Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
"Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.",Then the illusion is complete.,Like whale barf.
Look how ridiculous they look.,Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. Craw!,"Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!"
Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.,"'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.",Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
"Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. Just look her in the eye, start crying and say I've never been so happy.","You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!",At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
"OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?","Hmm, this love intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.",If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
No. Tell her she's special.,Ask her to mate with me.,"OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?"
"Well, tell her that. And then?",But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.,No. Tell her she's special.
No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. Yes?,Then mating.,"Well, tell her that. And then?"
You're not even trying!,Is desire to mate a feeling?,No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. Yes?
"OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.",It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.,You're not even trying!
"OK, go ahead.",What? Now there's a bird involved?,"OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing."
"You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.",I have no idea.,"What the--? Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?"
Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.,"Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.","I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense."
Now ask her how her day was.,"Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.",You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
You wouldn't. Ask anyway.,Why would I wanna know?,Now ask her how her day was.
That's normal. Just nod your head and say Uh-huh,"Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.",Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
Third date!,Do I ask her to mate now?,"...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental. You even stink more."
Turn it over.,I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.,So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.,Oy.,"Oh, Edna! Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest."
Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.,"I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?","Uh, me too."
No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.,"Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?",Come in.
"Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!","Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything. I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!",No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.","Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- Fry!","Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!"
But--,Her caviar is on your neck!,"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
What?!,"Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.",But--
English please?,Fry! I challenge you to Claw-Plach!,What?!
But I don't want her!,The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.,"And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!"
Leela!,Aww.,Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
Fatal.,"Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me: Disembowelling in your species - Fatal or non-fatal?","Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, come on baby!"
Shut up!,I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--,"Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?"
Shh! Nobody correct him!,I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!,"Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon. And you, doctor?"
But it's a fight to the death!,"Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.",Shh! Nobody correct him!
Uh-oh.,Please rise for the national anthem.,"Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
Hey!,Let Claw-Plach begin!,Uh-oh.
Aha! Oops!,"Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!",Ow!
"My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? One reason.",Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!,"Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!,"My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? One reason.",Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
"Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.","The frenzy! Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.","Oh, my God!"
"Ow, ow! Ah!","Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.","The frenzy! Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it."
I'll lend you this.,The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?,"Ow, ow! Ah!"
"Hey, hey.",Fry!,I'll lend you this.
You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?,"They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies.",Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
Tough call.,Yes.,You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
No biggie.,"Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry. Especially after I made a complete eel out of myself.",Tough call.
Yeah!,Yeah!,Hooray!
"I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?","I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it.",Yeah!
My legs!,"For you, my friend, anything.","I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.,Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.,"Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar. And I got all C's!"
"Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.","Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.","Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first. This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates."
"Sorry, I'm not here to buy.","No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?","Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!,I understand and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.,"Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
"Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we...",Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off. But I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.,Hermes. Who were you yelling at?
Shall we say 8 o'clock?,You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?,"Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we..."
"Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?","Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?",Shall we say 8 o'clock?
"So, what? Shorts?","The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.","Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
"Boy, this A.C. is incredible! I'd better turn on the heater too. Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.","So, what? Shorts?","The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava."
Yeah! We're slowing down!,"Hey, how about some icy margaritas?","Boy, this A.C. is incredible! I'd better turn on the heater too. Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
Who wants pop-tarts? Uh-oh!,Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!,Yeah! We're slowing down!
What are you doing?,"It's OK, I have an emergency phone.",Who wants pop-tarts? Uh-oh!
Phew!,Spluh! It's a video-phone. Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association. Hello? Septuple-A?,What are you doing?
"Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?","It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit.",Phew!
"I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?",I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!,"Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
"Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.","Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, Straighten your Pope hat, and, Put on your good vestments. You know, Fry, its nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk.","I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
Yeah.,"So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?","Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
Kind of.,Yep.,"Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business? Any new business? Anyone spend the night together?"
And it led there again when we got home.,We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.,"Oh, my God!"
What? No!,Do I hear wedding bells?,Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
"It's working, they think we're making out. Wait, why aren't we making out?",Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.,Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on; I need a stapler.
Wow! We're great kissers!,Hello!,Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier. Say hello to Miss Right!
"Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.","Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.",Wow! We're great kissers!
"Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.","Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.","Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
Don't you get it? She's smothering me.,You'll be back to zero soon enough.,"Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.,Hi.,Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's Amy!,Fry--!,You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
"Am I? Face it, I'm a prize catch. I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.",I think you're over reacting.,I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's Amy!
"Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us, I can't be alone with her.","Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.","Am I? Face it, I'm a prize catch. I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
"Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.","So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?","Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us, I can't be alone with her."
"Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?","No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.","Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... ... dry woven reeds! All gone! Can I drive?"
"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?","OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?","Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.",But you just said--,"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
"Pardon me, excuse me.",Wahoo!,"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?","Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!","Pardon me, excuse me."
"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?",Huh? You don't like chocolate?,"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
"Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--",Vroom vroom! And the winner of the big car race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!,"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?,Fry? Are you alright?,"Uh-oh. Here, you drive!"
How badly?,"No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.",Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
Where is it?,"That's it over there. Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.",How badly?
"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.","Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. Upsy daisy!",This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
"Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.",Fry!,"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
"Oh, that. Maybe we'd better talk in private. I'll meet you in the closet.","So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?","Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.","Oh, that. Maybe we'd better talk in private. I'll meet you in the closet.","So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
I just think we should start seeing other people.,You're breaking up with me?,"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
"I'm sorry, but it is.","But, I was really having fun. If that's how you feel.",I just think we should start seeing other people.
Huh?,"Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?","I'm sorry, but it is."
"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!","I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.",Huh?
Oh!,With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.,"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
"Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? In private?",600.,No!
"This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?","Oh, no problem.","Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? In private?"
Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.,"You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!","This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
Thanks.,Bender's in his office.,Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?,"OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.","I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.,What business is it of yours?,Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
What does it do?,This is deodorant.,And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
20 minutes? You're practically ready now!,I'll be waiting.,"C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes."
"Oh, God, it's true!","Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.",20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
Thanks. Where is she?,Thanks.,That dress looks great on you.
I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.,Mm-mm.,"I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?"
Uh--,How's them eats?,"Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
She seems a little old for me.,Don't mind if I do. Kids'll be hungry.,Uh--
"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.",I'll take one.,Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
But you just said--,Eight bucks.,"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
"Well, ma'am I--",So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?,Cheers!
"No, but I control this arm.",What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.,"Well, ma'am I--"
"Wait, come back, uh, darling.","Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.","No, but I control this arm."
"Oh, jeez, get a room!",You know what I'd like to do...?,"Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise."
"Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.",Maybe later.,"Oh, jeez, get a room!"
Nooo! That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. Ooh! Ow!,Let me pick up the check.,"Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
"Oh, Leela!","Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.",Nooo! That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. Ooh! Ow!
Thank you.,It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...,"Oh, I do."
Can I live without it?,"There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.",Thank you.
"So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.",I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.,If you call that living.
"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.","It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you.","So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
"Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. Ow! Cool! Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.",So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?,"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
I guess so. Watch the neck! Watch the neck!,Yeah.,"True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.,Sounds like your kinda place Fry. Wanna go?,Dy-no-mite!
"Cool, it's just like the good old days!",Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...,But Bender you are -
"Hey Leela, get a picture of me being mugged.",Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!,"Cool, it's just like the good old days!"
Yeah I asked a cop once. It means Up yours kid.,Do you know what it means?,I direct your attention to this ancient and mysterious tablet which has yet to be deciphered.
"Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth.","I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a suicide booth! So long suckers.",Yeah I asked a cop once. It means Up yours kid.
In New York? Bathrooms.,What were they used for?,Oh.
I'll show you. Whup.,How does this work?,Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
"No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent.",What's this? Another bathroom?,"Ohh, it's a turnstile."
We sometimes called it a jogging suit.,It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.,Wow. Now this guy had taste!
"Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains.",The fruit of the robots' labour was this......the stately 1992 Latoura.,We've come a long way baby!
"C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.","Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?","Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains."

Nope. No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. Nice! Listen to that baby purr!,Did you drive much in the 20th century Fry?,"Here, move this rust bucket outside behind Saint Koch's cathedral."
It's just like riding a bicyc -,There's a baby in there huh?,Nope. No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. Nice! Listen to that baby purr!
I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.,I meant ass whiplash.,"You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
How's that robot I ran over?,Ow! I think I got whiplash.,I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
You mean he's -,We did all we could.,How's that robot I ran over?
I don't get it.,No way! Mine's 2716057!,3370318.
"So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?",We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.,I don't get it.
Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.,"Well I don't feel as bad as you look! Nah I'm just messing with you kid. You're alright. That's some face you got though, I think they got a cream for that. Nah, you're great.","So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
Uh...sure.,Actually your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?,Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
How's that?,"Aw yeah, that's it. A little lower.",Uh...sure.
Uh I can't get any lower than this.,Lower. Yeah that's it. A little lower though.,How's that?
I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.,Gyrate baby!,Alright mama!
"Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan.",And that ain't silicon. It's tungsten - and plenty of it!,"Shut up and hoot. Hubba-hubba, she is built! In Mexico I believe."
"Uh, no, that's alright. Ow! Ow!","Yeah, how 'bout a lapdance for my pal here?",Thanks moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction.
I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.,"Uh, no, that's alright. Ow! Ow!","Yeah, how 'bout a lapdance for my pal here?"
Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.,It's funny because it's poisonous!,"Hey Fry, think fast. Get it? It's chlorine!"
"He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet.",Take a rage dump man. He's no worse than Bender.,Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
I'm talking about Flexo.,That's Bender alright.,"He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet."
No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.,"Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!",I'm talking about Flexo.
Can I touch it?,And huge.,It's beautiful.
"Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great but -","Oh oh Mr Professor, right here!","Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
"Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.","Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me. Welcome aboard lad.
"Wait, let's go by rank.","OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.","Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
Flexo outranks me?,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.","Wait, let's go by rank."
Don't point that at me.,Halt. Who goes there?,"That's Flexo outranks me, sir!"
"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.",Fry who?,Don't point that at me.
I'm not prejudiced.,My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you pal. An ugly little word called prejudice.,"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
Caught you! I saw you looking at the atom!,Alright.,"Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while."
Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?,So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?,Caught you! I saw you looking at the atom!
Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.,"Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. Nah, I'm just kidding you, you're a joker.",Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?
That I will.,Suit yourself skinbag.,Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
Good.,Good.,That I will.
Good.,Good.,Good.
Good. Good.,Good.,Good.
"Well, that's eight hours.",Good. Good.,Good.
"Finally, the atom is safe.","Yeah eight hours of solid boredom. Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man.","Well, that's eight hours."
No.,What is it? My God! Did you hear maracas?,"Finally, the atom is safe."
He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?,How could Flexo have stolen the atom?,Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.
Then I must've fallen asleep.,No.,He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?
Aha! Uh searching...hmm.,Aha!,Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.,Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?,Aha! Uh searching...hmm.
"Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?","Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room.",I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
Give it up!,Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.,"Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
"Or maybe, he never left at all! Wait a minute. You're Bender.",He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.,It's a darn shame.
"But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity number?","Of course, who said I wasn't?","Or maybe, he never left at all! Wait a minute. You're Bender."
"100,000?","So you lost the atom huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you braindead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?","Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages."
"Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.",You're closest without going over.,"200,001?"
Flexo!,"Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned.","Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin."
Flexo! Shoot Flexo!,I don't know which one to shoot.,"No shoot him, he's choking me!"
Bender? You stole the atom?,Aw jeez.,"Alright, enough of this. There's the atom!"
"Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well not that shocked.",I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.,"Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable."
I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?,"Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care. Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright.","I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all."
"Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.",Me too.,I almost had that tiara.
Oh. Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?,"Fry, that's a radiator.","Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
"Hey, Hermes!","Good morning, people.","Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love. And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!,The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.,So how was the Spleef Nebula?
"Hey, yeah!","Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. Let's ditch him and go to the movies!",Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
"Cool, let's see this one!",I'm seeing a movie with friends!,"Hey, yeah!"
"Yeah, I wanna see that.",Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.,Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
I'll take a small Slurm.,"Good point, Bender.","Yeah, I wanna see that."
"Uh, OK. Oh, man!","For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small.",I'll take a small Slurm.
"Ooh, this is real futuristic!",Glagnar's Human Rinds presents: This Week In The Universe.,Down in front!
No I didn't!,You have pressed 2.,"If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now."
Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?,No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.,Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
Bender rules!,"Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender! And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!",Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
"Wow! Thanks, Hermes! I-- Hey! Cut that out!",I got you an official Bender hat.,Bender rules!
"Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.","So then I said, See you at the fight. And that's the story.",See you at the fight.
Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!,No argument here.,"It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead."
Hey!,Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.,It smells like burning recess monkey.
My God! It's full of ads!,Behold! The internet!,Hey!
It's immense.,Follow me!,My God! It's full of ads!
So I see!,It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.,It's immense.
"Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?",A woman. I'm scared.,"I'm a woman if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
"Uh, video game you say? Well golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.",We call it a video game.,Get ready for fun Fry. Nowadays we have a type of game played entirely on video.
Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do - Gotcha! I won! I'm the greatest!,"Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am.",Do you think perhaps you and I - ?
Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?,Come on. We have worked to do.,Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do - Gotcha! I won! I'm the greatest!
Kicked your ass!,To: Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alkazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oaffish moron.,Huh? It's him!
Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.,Leela we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.,Kicked your ass!
Lazy sculptor!,Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.,Too bad it's a dump.
"Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?",This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.,There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
What's over that hill?,"And there's the pirate Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.",Oh please! Really?
Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak. Ow!,The Forbidden Valley. A holy sancturary where no one may tread.,What's over that hill?
Ow!,"Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?",Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak. Ow!
Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!,Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.,"Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic."
He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife jerk.","OK OK, I'll do the dishes. Hey where'd they go?"
Try and stop me!,He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife jerk."
"'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad for you. He -",Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?,"Jeez Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!"
You do?,I know.,"'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad for you. He -"
Then dump his one eyed ass.,Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.,You do?
I'll be there.,I'll break up with him at dinner.,I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.
C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!,"Yeah, like crap.","Yo Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap."
No! No!,"Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit faucets. Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slash flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and - stop eating pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question......Leela, will you marry me?",I'm trying.
Ohh!,Yes! I Will!,No! No!
"Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.",Oh this is great!,Hello!
The corner! Why didn't I think of that?,Animals go in the corner.,"Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.,"Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. Here, try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.",The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.,That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.,"Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. Here, try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.,Uh no thanks I'm good.,Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
"Bender, snap out of it!",I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.,But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
"Come on boy, jump! Good boy!",That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.,"Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go. I love stealing, I love taking things!"
My God! Four identical castles!,Whoa Mittens!,"Come on boy, jump! Good boy!"
"That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.",Each more identical than the last!,My God! Four identical castles!
"Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list.",What the?,Oh my God!
Oh yeah? Then what about this?,"It, uh, oo! Uh, hey sweetie, just go back to the castle and wait for me. She, she's nuts, I can morph into a 5-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.","Alkazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?"
And maybe you'd like to meet her. And her.,Go back to the castle Sandy.,Who are they?
"Hey, that's what I do.",Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.,"If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
I'll play.,I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.,I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
"Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?","Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.","We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.,Sorry. I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way - a glass of warm milk and good night sleep.,"Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
What's with the specs Bender?,"C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.",And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives serparate.
Hey!,They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.,What's with the specs Bender?
"It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.","Finally, I have a good claw. See? Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.",I can't spell anything with these cards.
Oh man!,"Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage. Read 'em and leak saltwater!","It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.,Oh! I'll never pass inspection now! They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick - at carnival time. And that's as low as limbo sticks get.,"Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
"Jeez Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.",This way please.,Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
I thought it would fit.,Fry got his head stuck in a crater.,"I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?"
"Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.",I - I've never seen anything like this. Why is there yoghurt in this cap?,"Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely."
"Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a Ph.","You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.","Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.,"Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a Ph.","You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone."
Oh stop!,I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you!,What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
Just like very other girl I've dated.,Now listen you filthy pig. No-one can know about us. If anyone asks I'll deny it.,Oh stop!
All right!,"And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.",That's a full time job.
Morgan? It's 3am.,No. I'm in front of you!,"Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept on coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is it's Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing scazwag. Why if she were here I'd - Uh oh is she behind me?"
Eat and sleep.,"I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you. My God, it's so...repulsive. So uh, this is where you eat?",Morgan? It's 3am.
"Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second.",Oh Fry!,Eat and sleep.
"Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!",I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.,"Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the? Oh now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. It's all coming together now!"
"Hey, what did you do to him?","That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it! and they'll say Who Bender, who? and I'll say It was lovable......old Bender.","No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternize."
"But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making! What did you do now? Stop doing things!","I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.","Hey, what did you do to him?"
"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.",I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do Fry. He was a bad robot.,"But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making! What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.,Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.,"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.,You and Morgan were having an affair?,Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!,I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.,You and Morgan were having an affair?
"Man, how long is this gonna take?",Oh Lord!,But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4 if they used the empty carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.
OK.,FRY,OK.
We'll never find that disk will we Bender?,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?",Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.,We'll never find that disk will we Bender?,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
"Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times sake?",Lost something? I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.,You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.
Yeah!,"I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!","Sing me home! When push comes to shove, You gotta do what you love, Even if it's not a good idea!"
"That's right, she fraternized me!",Not so fast! When I was sortin' I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B: Notification Of Romantic Entanglement.,"Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second -"
What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?,It's better than nothing!,"Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced pay of course."
"Oh. Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought Why should I? Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!","And now, a man who needs no introduction. Fry, get up there!",I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
Dork alert!,"Oh. Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought Why should I? Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!","And now, a man who needs no introduction. Fry, get up there!"
Leela! He could live another 100 years!,No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.,My life is over.
"Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?","No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.",Leela! He could live another 100 years!
A successor?,"There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.",If only it'd worked. You could go back and not waste your time on it.
"Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.",There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!,A successor to the Professor?
Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.,Yesh he would.,"Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
One foot in the grave.,Buh!,True mon!
Oh yeah!,...So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith - even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. My closest living relative...,One foot in the grave.
Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?,He's horrible!,"My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
Where did Cubert come from?,You wish!,Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
"Well, once in the park.",Never.,No.
Little twerp.,What is it? A compitent employee? I doubt that very much!,"Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
We've gotta get him back.,You bastard!,I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
"Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.",Impossible. No one knows where they take those old geezers.,We've gotta get him back.
Uh...what?,"You're his uncle dummy, he takes after you.","Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
"To the left! No to the up! U-turn, U-turn!",To the flying machine!,I'm zeroing in on him. Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
I'm on it!,"OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160 year old man.",There it is! The Near-Death Star!
I'd like to see them find it!,Now they may ask for a DNA sample.,"My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!"
'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.,Why do I have to be the hump?,I think I know where to get some.
"What? I'm old. Listen. Hey you kids, get off the lawn!",This guest does not look 160.,Escaped? No one escapes.
Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.,Did you hump just say something?,Stupid robot.
So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.,Prepare to be surprised.,Sounds nice.
Will too.,"It's impossible, we'll never fit.","We're probably going to make it, but we might not."
"Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal.",Told you.,Will too.
Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!,They've blown out one of our engines!,"Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
Try shocking him.,Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.,Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!
"Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.",Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to. Young people use curse words!,Try shocking him.
So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?,I'm as spry as a 140 year old. See? I only broke one ankle.,All right!
This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.,Bender!,"Everybody kick in five bucks. There, wasn't that interesting?"
"Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.","Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.","I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! Beat it, you mooching crawdad!"
I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!,Fine. I'll head over to the other side. Good luck fishing on this side!,"Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
A shrimp? I find it a bit hard to believe that--,"Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!",I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
"Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!",Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!,"Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?"
"Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!","Oh, my!",I'm so into you!
It's diving!,A colossal-mouth bass!,"Oh, that's big!"
How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?,"Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.","Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
How do we do that?,We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.,What's that? Is someone bending girders?
"Wait, I'll be back in a minute.",We're all gonna die!,That should do it.
Did what?,"You did it, Fry!","Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.,"OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.","The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg, I mean lobster Newburg, I mean Doctor Zoidberg."
I can't swallow that.,Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.,"Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugarcane truck."
Mermaid.,"What is it, Fry?","Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
A mermaid!,"Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.","Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!"
"No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley tail. And I think she had hair extensions.",You think you saw a mermaid?,A mermaid!
"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.","You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.","OK, Fry!"
"Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.",I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.,"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
"Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it? It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! Oh! oxygen!",He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.,Ocean madness.
"Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!","Here you go, darlin'.","Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it? It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! Oh! oxygen!"
What?,"Oh, you speak fish?","Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?","I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!",What?
"Aw, yeah!",Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.,"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.,Did it just get warmer?,"Aw, yeah!"
"Oh, Thanks. They're called pants.","Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.",I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
No kidding.,This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.,"Oh, Thanks. They're called pants."
"Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.",Did it just get colder? Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?,No kidding.
And sometimes it doesn't.,Hm.,"Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky."
"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.","Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!",And sometimes it doesn't.
Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!,Lions? There are sealions on the land?,"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
"Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.","Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!","Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!"
I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.,"So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?","Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees."
"That's right, honey! Whatever you say.","No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.",I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
"Aw, shucks, Colonel.","So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if old legs here ain't grown on me!","Normally, yes, but the caffine really sped things up. That stuff's wonderful."
Wait. I'm not going with you.,"Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.","Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen."
Realise it? I don't even understand it!,"Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?","She's right, I mean sure they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony."
I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.,It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.,Realise it? I don't even understand it!
"Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.","You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?",I'm bored! Let's go!
"You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.",That just raises further questions!,So that's where I left my cigar.
Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!,"Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.","You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?,What the hell is that?,Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
"Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?","I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser.",Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!,Prepare for launch.,There! The engine modifications are complete.
"Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.",What about Umbriel?,"Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
"Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!",Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.,"Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
"No. In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.",I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?,"Leela, we're right here."
Yeah!,Alright!,"Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget."
No thanks. That's robot food.,"Oh Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!",Wood!
No really I don't - Mmm!,It's so good. Oh just try a little!,No thanks. That's robot food.
1200?,Hey I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.,You're charging us? After you blinded me?
"No, I was just picking my nose.",He's making a break for it. Get him!,You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
He's made of candy.,And hard working.,He's so polite.
Alright!,"OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.",He's made of candy.
But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.,An alibi huh?,"Now since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi."
OK you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.,But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.,An alibi huh?
Bender's sick. Need any help taking off?,OK you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.,But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.
"Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.",We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!,"Oh, we'll kill 'em alright."
"Uh, Leela?",I'm taking evasive action.,"Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
"Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance.",I'm back at the wheel Fry. Everything's under control.,Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say Turnmaster Steering company say Nibbler? Oh no!
Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.,You'll never get away with this.,"Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars."
No!,Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.,"Hey boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here."
"Oh no, poor Bender.","Uh wait, old...spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.",I got a little surprise in store for that guy. The clamps! Eh?
"Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it reminscing about Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic.",Phew.,He's gonna get clamps? Clamps clamps......clamps clamps!
You're OK!,Bender!,"Uh, help! Help!"
"I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.",Yeah it broke alright,Alright!
It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.,"Oh sweet legal tender! Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.",Fine kick sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
"I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink, but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants - which they borrowed from me!",Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!,Futurama is brought to you by......Molten Boron!
Ugh!,"Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!",Dinner ready?
Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.,Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser.  whispering to Leela  Work his gut; I like it tender.,Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.,"Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.",Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
Here's something. It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.,Not even if they're sauted in a little mud?,No.
"Well? How are they? Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm having them!",Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.,"What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns."
Look! Here's more!,You know what these would go great with? Rocks.,"Well? How are they? Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm having them!"
Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.,The planet's covered with 'em.,Look! Here's more!
"I know, we'll call them Popplers!","According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are Popplers and Zittzers.","It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?"
Swish!,You sure picked it.,"Oh, yeah, why not?"
"Hey, yeah.","Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!",Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
"Hey, business is great.",Bender's a genius.,Good idea.
Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?,"Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gillman.",Eat it or beat it.
A dollar a dozen.,"Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?","Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot."
How do we sign?,Yes! I'm gonna be rich. You too but it's hard to get excited about that.,You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
Pop a Poppler in your mouth,How do we sign?,Yes! I'm gonna be rich. You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!,"Move it, man. Come on!",I can't pay.
"Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?","I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say mama.","Yes, listen to the father."
Like Fry! Like Fry!,Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick. Like Fry.,"Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?"
"People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.","Take a coupon, cut it out! Ow! Ow!","Hey, cut it out!"
Turanga?,"Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have with us the CEO of Fishy Joe's, Mr. Fishy Joseph Gillman......Noted anti-eating activist, Free Waterfall Jr......And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela.","Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce......stop eating them with tangy sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had! Ow!"
I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.,"Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring 'round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule.",We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
"What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.","I'll miss you, Leela. I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.",Get a job!
You mean -,Wingus? Dingus? Listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!,"Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?"
That's Leela!,Bingo!,"Please, I'm creating. Voila!"
No!,Please! I just paid off my car!,"Stop talking, you're getting cold."
"Hear, hear!",A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.,"Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!"
"Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.",Here you go.,"Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please."
OK.,Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.,Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
"Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.","Come on, you call yourselves chumps?",I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
Not really.,"Um, alright.","Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
"Hey, who's this guy?","That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.",They're so lifeless-like.
"I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.","I'm the janitor, I'm trying to take a nap here.","Hey, who's this guy?"
"I mean, I thought you were one of the wax robots.","I am made of wax, what's it to you?","I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
"Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.","Hey, let me try. Whoa, that gives me a headache!",See through the eyes of a bender unit. Fine.
"Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.",That's my mama!,Let the bloodbath begin!
"Yes, please.",Would you like cream?,"Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
"Oh, uh, OK.",Out of cream!,"Yes, please."
"Yes, uh, eight spoons.",Would you like sugar in your coffee?,"Oh, uh, OK."
"Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.",Out of coffee!,"Yes, uh, eight spoons."
Violent media? What a load of -,"Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media.",Morbo demands comments.
No!,Stop!,Really?
"Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.","By the way, try washing your wrist sometime.",Hey!
"In my time, we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow! I'm hungry!",It'll be the end of civilised society.,"Are you mad? Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?"
"W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?",We want you to get back together with Mom. Please. It's the only way to make her happy again.,Wha? W-What do you want from me?
"Hey, the TV's getting away!",Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!,"But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots."
"Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.",The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.,The man is going to touch Mommy?
"Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.",The professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?,"No. We're set for fire, thanks."
It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!,Impossible!,"Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering."
There. Finished!,"Show us this, the wheel.",Never heard of it.
"It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!",Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?,Wow!
Ow!,Heyya!,"It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
"And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.",Here. Give her these.,I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
Yes!,Won't you come in?,You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.,Where in funkytown is the professor?,"I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!"
There it is!,"I suppose I should switch of the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.",They're inside! Get 'em!
Is anything not a robot?,Fan beats man!,There it is!
"Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!",No!,"No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
Ooh!,"Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it the fing-longer. Observe. And, here we go. There!","By Eric Rogers, Ken Keeler amp; David X. Cohen Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
"Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?","Pretty long, eh?",Ah!
Does it really work?,"Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.","Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?"
I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend? Ow!,My work here is done!,"Let's watch, shall we?"
Who are you?,I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend? Ow!,My work here is done!
You too? Will you be my friend?,I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!,Who are you?
"Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--","Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. Hey! Aw, quit it1 Come on!","Put it there, pal! I meant your wallet."
"Hey, Bender?",Hmm?,Who wants lobster bisque?
Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?,Huh?,"Hey, Bender?"
"Goodnight, sweet prince.",I'll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I. Not I.,Who put this in here?
"Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.","Come on, woman! Just pick something.","Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about."
Ew! What smells like boot feet?,"Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?","Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat."
"I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.","So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! A letter from Bender, my good friend. Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--","Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--"
Whatcha eating?,Could you get the lights on your way out?,"I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV."
"Sure. Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.",Lobster. Want some?,Whatcha eating?
Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?,Really?,"Sure. Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths."
No?,No.,Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
Then ... then ... it was you!,No!,No?
"Well, that covers the first three killings.",I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.,Then ... then ... it was you!
I like it!,"So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?","And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!"
I really like it!,Good. Now let me just get the lights.,I like it!
"Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?",Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?,I really like it!
I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.,You idiot! We already saw that.,"Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?"
"Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?",We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.,I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
"Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud! Here's to another lousy Millennium! Ow! I should have left you floating in the toilet!","That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way. What would happen if Fry never came to the future?","Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?"
Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?,"Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!",It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
"You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?","If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!",Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?,"Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!",No. Today I'd like something good.
"Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it? 'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it a Fry Hole.",Sure. Why not?,Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
Who said that? Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!,There he is. Seize him.,Toss it in the garbage!
Who are you people?,Who said that? Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!,There he is. Seize him.
I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.,I'm Al Gore. And these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; A group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.,Who are you people?
Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.,"That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the constitution!",I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
"Where am I, anyway?","Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that.",Bishop to knight 4.
So what do you nerds want?,A school bus!,You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
No fair! I saw it first!,I call it a Hawking Hole.,It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.,"If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.",That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
"But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.",I call it a Hawking Chamber.,So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
"Uh, what?",Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.,"But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head."
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,Check.,Hold him down.
Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.,"Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.","Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!"
"OK, here I go.",Here. Take my plus-one mace.,Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?,You fool! You foolish fool!,"OK, here I go."
Destroyed? Then where are we now?,Great. The entire universe was destroyed.,Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?
Sure.,Anyone wanna play Dungeons amp; Dragons for the next quadrillion years?,Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
Good work.,"That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of. Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.",I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
"Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?","I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck! Oh no, my uncle Vladimir.","Oh no, someone you know must've died."
"Bender, wake up! He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?",No!,"Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
"Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.","Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!","Bender, what happened?"
"Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.","I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet.","We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!"
"Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!","No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.","Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
I wouldn't wanna be me right now.,"Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.",No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
"It'll be a rich, full day.","Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.",Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
"Bender, no!","Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.","It'll be a rich, full day."
You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?,"Fry, stay back!","Bender, no!"
"I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.",You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?,"Fry, stay back!"

No one can make me leave!","Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave."
"Obviously you've never been in love! Ow! Ow! Ow! Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe.",He's bluffing. No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.,Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.","You've damaged your brain Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone.",Stop it man!
"I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!",Wait a minute man!,"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me."
"I'm about to. Leela, let me play for you one for time.",Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?,Stop! We'll leave. But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again! Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
"Please, it's important to me.",You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.,"I'm about to. Leela, let me play for you one for time."
I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts. Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like -,What's that supposed to mean?,"Please, it's important to me."
Nothing. I got rid of the worms.,What's happened to you?,I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts. Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like -
"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.",What? Why would you do that?,Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
"I did. I think. It was probably about 50 50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!",Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?,"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
"Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!",I don't know.,"I did. I think. It was probably about 50 50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
"Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.","Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!","Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!"
He's got me beat!,"Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?","People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs."
He's dead.,Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?,All opposed? All abstaining?
I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.,"Look, you fat fish. The Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell.",You Latins are so hot-blooded! This one's like a summer guy!
We gotta go rescue them!,The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.,I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
Bender! Think of the seoritas!,"Eh, I don't know.",We gotta go rescue them!
"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?","Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on. I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--",No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.,No. But what do you make of this?,"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
"Alright, here's the plan--",Move! Go!,"Oh, your God!"
Pfft. A female leader?,We take them to our leader. She know what do.,Women go free. Men stay in chains.
"Yes, captain!","Fry, shut up.",Pfft. A female leader?
Is she hot?,"Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate.",I'm already looking for apartments.
"In other words, No. Ow!",That not important. She all-knowing.,Is she hot?
"It was an accident, ma'am.",Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.,"Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps."
"Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.",That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.,"It was an accident, ma'am."
What'd they die of?,Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?,"Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu."
Yes!,Crushed pelvises.,What'd they die of?
Yay!,"After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death. By snu-snu!","Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!"
Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.,Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.,"What are you, gay?"
"Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.","Me too, meatbag.","I'll miss you, meatbag."
Ooh! Yeah!,"Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! Alright, I'll go!","We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
Can't we just cuddle? Nooo!,It time snu-snu!,We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
"Oh, yeah!",It sure was.,"Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
Making the noise.,Dark matter indicator?,Present.
Yep.,"Sabotage. This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.",Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
That doesn't look like an L at all. Unless you count lowercase.,"And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.",It's an important unit.
Who would do a thing like that?,Hmm. It should look like this. But instead it looks like this.,Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
Huh?,I know how to settle this: We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.,"Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending."
Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.,"See? Nothing. Told you, losers.",Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
You weren't sleepwalking. You were sleep-bending!,Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.,I'm sleepwalking.
You're only four years old?,Sure. It was only four years ago.,You remember your own birth?
"Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?","What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops. Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.","There, little friend. Good as new."
I wish! It's a nickel.,"Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.","Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?"
Alright!,My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.,"Oh, yeah? Prove it. Here, let me help you."
She sure does.,"I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast. To Angleyne, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.","So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours."
Yeah. Either that or be a man.,Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.,I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
That's thinkin' like a man.,"OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angleyne while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself.",Yeah. Either that or be a man.
"Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.",Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.,"Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time."
"Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep......three sheep.","Dog food, you say?","500, you say?"
I love these things!,I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!,"Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!"
"Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.",Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.,That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show. And the grand prize winner......the Hypno-Toad. All glory to the Hypno-Toad.
Looks like this planet is next in line.,"This is mighty strange. First, the civilisation Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went caflooie and now Tweenis",Excuse me.
I'd hate to be those guys.,That's Earth. The planet we live on.,Looks like this planet is next in line.
Leela back yet?,"Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself. Nibbler? Nibbler, you're scaring me. Nibbler?! Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me? Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here. Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?","No! Nibbler, come back!"
You don't have a heart; you're a robot.,"Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!",Leela back yet?
"Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.","Sure...right. Robot! Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.",You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
"Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.",Am I a robot?,"Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal."
Dr. Zoidberg? Why is everyone acting so weird?,Ow. Ow. Ow. I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.,Fry! My skin!
I just let you back in!,Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! Zoidy want go outside!,Dr. Zoidberg? Why is everyone acting so weird?
"Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?","Hello, little man. I will destroy you!",It's a T. It goes tuh.
Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!,Look at me! I'm invisible!,On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
Attention New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!,"Now, when you say special...",There is but one being that can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizzare brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack. He is the hope of the universe. The fate of your world - perhaps all worlds - rests in his special mind.
"Time to re-educate you duncebags. We'll start with US presidents. This is our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?",We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.,That's why we wrote it down for you.
Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?,Thomas Jefferson?,A pickle jar?
"Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.",I...have to tell...must...important...something...,Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
Thanks!,This! You for this!,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute."
"No, Leela. Brain make people smart.",Brain. Brain make people dumb.,Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down.
Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?,You go fight biggest brain of all.,"No, Leela. Brain make people smart."
Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The libary!,I 'unno!,Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
I'm here to kick your ass.,"Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool: Your decimal system has played right into my hands! What do you want?",Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The libary!
"That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! Thinking...thinking...",Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses. Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.,I'm here to kick your ass.
"Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.",Oh! Stop that!,"That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! Thinking...thinking..."
"Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me think. Too easy. Too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!",Duh...,"Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic."
Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!,"Oh, niggle-snoosh!",Sometimes I fear we are cute.
Where are we?,Icky!,You have not won yet. Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.
"Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!","Wait! That no white whale. It grey, pink-y whale!",I saw it first!
Follow him! It's our only way out!,"Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!","Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!"
"Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?",Follow him! It's our only way out!,"Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!"
Come on!,"Please, no!","Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity."
Tou think I'm an oddity? Wait'l you see --,"Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age.",Come on!
"Hey, Brain-y, think fast!",Well...,"Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?"
"Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg.",The whale! He be white now!,I always think fast.
"Yes! I'm free! Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!",Is there Mrs. Queequeg?,"Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg."
"Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph......Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end. There! Now he's trapped in a book I wrote: A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.","Fry, don't die! Wake up! Nooo!","Yes! I'm free! Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!"
I did it! And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.,Me...feel...a bit better in cognitive faculties.,The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done.
Alright!,"Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!","So I says, Super collider? I just met her! And then they built the super collider. Thank you, you've been a great audience."
He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.,What's with Monstro?,We'll split an order.
Since when have you been in the biz?,"Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.",I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
"Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.","Good morning, Mr. Vice President!","I agreed to be your vice president but I never agreed to be your son. Thank you, Lieutenant Smith."
"Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights. Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!","It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.",That's fine too.
It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?,"Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. Alright, we're already one hour behind. Our first award tonight, Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum.","And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal."

"Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.","It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life. The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!",What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!,"Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!",Hit the deck!

"Alright, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.",To avoid the tollbooth.,Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
Bender?,"I said hand it over! Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? No I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!",This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer - in this comic I drew.,"Well, I do think of human life as expendable.","That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
I am at ease.,Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!,"Now little lady, those people's asses are living things too!"
Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps and pepperoni slices.,Brilliant!,"...But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
"Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt.",Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?,Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps and pepperoni slices.
If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.,"Eh, I've heard better.","Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.,"Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!",If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
What's happening?,He must be talking on a cell phone!,Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?,All 6000 hulls have been breached!,What's happening?
"You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?",They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. And eating penguin eggs.,"Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
He didn't?,I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.,"Dammit Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain."
"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship.",No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.,He didn't?
"Madam, I am in command now.",Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.,"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship."
Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.,"Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.",Then let's fish.
Granted. We can't take off without our captain.,"Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. Permission to come aboard Wiggles?","Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
"So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?","Oh, and bring my toboggan.",Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
I 'unno.,Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?,"So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
C'mon!,Mine! Mine!,"Son your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution. Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft."
I'll tell you when my horse finishes...bad.,How'd you do Fry?,No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
"Come on, come on! Hey Leela, how 'bout a kiss for good luck? I meant tongue luck.",Ooo look! It's the centaur race!,"Hey baby, ever do it in a suitcase?"

Pah. I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.,Let's just say I lucked out at the track! Also I rigged one race.,Well someone's in a good mode.
I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.,So whatever happened to this seven leaf clover?,"I got your page Mr Fry, your new hair is ready!"
Hey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground in the ruins of Old New York. Helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn it's luck around.,So the clover is still in the hiding place maybe?,I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone.

"Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.","Hell, no.","Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?"
"Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.",Roger.,"What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless."
Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.,"It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?","Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry."
She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.,"OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance. Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?","Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little."
Oh! That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.,"Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.",She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
Nooo! Did you see it? Did you see it?,"Detonation in three, two, one.",Oh! That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
"No, not the explosion!",The explosion?,Nooo! Did you see it? Did you see it?
Nothing.,Then what?,"No, not the explosion!"
"I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried.",Saw it comin'!,No! Eva Braun! Help me!
Yeah.,Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?,"I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried."
Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.,They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.,Yeah.
"How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from.",We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.,Big deal.
Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?,Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?,"How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from."
Everything?,Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.,No. Why would I know that?
"Yeah, what did they ever do for me?",Sos your fantasy's always been to destroys a planet huh?,Except that.
I wanna see the edge of the universe!,"Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?","Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
"Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?","It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things til somebody comes to visit.",Ooo! That sounds cool.
"Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.","No, just the two.","Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?"
"Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! Woohoo! Whoopie!",I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.,"Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
That was fun. Let's give him a treat!,Don't look at him!,"Mommy, why is that man like that?"
The tongue tickles.,Keep your palms flat.,That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.,The tongue tickles.,Keep your palms flat.
I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.,Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.,These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.
OK.,I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.,I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
It is?,"Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.",LEELA
Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?,Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.,It is?
"Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!",It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.,Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?
Ooo! eBay!,You take that back!,"Eh, at least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald!"
So where's the celebrity dating place?,Yes.,Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy? Sold to the Being Of Inconceivable Horror.
Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.,Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock. Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?,Let's search the web. Over there.
I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?,"Then uh, how about Cleopatra? Who's beauty destroyed mighty empires.",Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
I'd like the 2003 model.,"Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu. Only woman ever to be named People magazine's woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063.",I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?

Did you hear that? She likes me!,I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive Philip J. Fry.,"Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.,Well duh! She's programmed to like you!,Did you hear that? She likes me!
"Uh, not right now.",Would you like to take a moment to register me?,But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
"So uh, what do you feel like doing?",I'll remind you later you hot stud you!,"Uh, not right now."
I said later!,Would you like to take a moment to register me?,"So uh, what do you feel like doing?"
"Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more.",I said later!,Would you like to take a moment to register me?
Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.,You should write a book Fry. People need to know about the can eat more.,"Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
You're cute!,"My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts.",Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
You!,You're cute!,You're cute!
You!,You!,You!
You!,You!,You!
"Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.",She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -,"Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for us to interfere in his life."
This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!,Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes.,Robot Crane style!
"Aww, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet. Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?",Fry?,Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross!
Let me see. Yep. Why do you ask?,"Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?",Read the jar Evelyn Wood! Dr Z?
"Quick, this way!",And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.,Why?
"Sorry laides, employees only.","Quick, this way!",And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.

What are you doing darling? Get down!,"Oh Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the poetic image number 37 not found.","Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity.

You saved us. Are you alright?,What are you doing darling? Get down!,"Oh Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the poetic image number 37 not found."
What?? No!,Erase her Fry.,Yes.
But I just downloaded her because I love you.,"Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission you stole my image. And in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world - one mile in diameter.",What?? No!
I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.,"If you love the real Lucy Liu and not what you've seen in movies, genre stradling lawyer shows and kiss ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot.",But I just downloaded her because I love you.
Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.,I know it hurts buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.,I'll always remember you Fry  mechanical voice  memory deleted.
"But, but!",It's true. Bender and I are in love.,Pft! Yeah at our wedding!

"Bender, are you OK?",Ah those things cost more lives than they save.,"Not if I can help it! Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seatbelts."
Yo!,Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave...,Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
My God! This mean the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell...was...us!,"That's no flying saucer, that's my ass!",No over here! Flying Saucer Captured!
"Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed at Roswell.","Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave from somewhere around here. Meanwhile you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.",You've got 8. But a more urgent concern is the microwave. Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
Got it.,"Your grandfather? Stay away from him you dimwitted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case. for the love of God, don't not do it!","Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed at Roswell."

That's it! This place is too dangerous. We've gotta get you out of here! Everything's gonna be alright Dad!,"Well, thanks soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken? It's part of the job! Mmm! Finger licking good!","I had no choice. I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear."

Thank God I got you off that dangerour army base!,Ooo that's good news! You know you really don't cook enough roast Leela! Ooo. Women!,Sir you're wife's hysterical. So I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only 5 hours to cook a roast.

"OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.",For me it is! I'm getting you out of here!,"Well, it ain't as bad as getting killed!"
Safe and sound! Finally I can continue to exist!,"OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.",For me it is! I'm getting you out of here!
"Well, I killed my grandfather.","No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was.",Wait a second. There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!
I dunno. Maybe God loves me.,Wait. If you killed your grandfather then why do you stll exist?,Wha?
"Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.","Killed? In an atomic blast? No sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly",I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
Then you're a braver woman than I.,I'm not worried about that.,"Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
"Uh, how far is it?",You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?,Then you're a braver woman than I.

I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do which proves...you can't really be my grandm -,How 'bout these cookies sugar?,"Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"

"It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?",Come back to bed deary!,Relax! She can't be my grandmother! I figured it all out.

"Take this Mr President, sir!",Heyya! Ya! Ya!,Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!

Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.,Sacred ball of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.,"In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying I told you so."
Alright!,"Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.","Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed."

Don't do it! He's evil!,"Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?","I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas."
Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.,Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.,No power.
But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!,"What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.",Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
Kinda gamey.,"Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon.",How does it work?
Bender no! You'll make God cry.,"So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone. Nah it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.",It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you Amy!

"Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?","No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.",Thank you.
"Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!","We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream.","Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
"For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees. Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.","You save us sir, if we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine.",Oh thank you magic biped!
"Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. Ah, the Earthican pasttime, blernsball!","Hey, ocupado!","For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees. Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them."

I don't understand this blernsball.,"Mulligan drives the ball, it's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Man I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker!

"Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?",All the whole numbers have been retired.,Why is your number seven-eight's?
"Ohh, now I'm too nervous.",Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.,"Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
Go Leela!,Woo! Come on! Throw like a girl!,Yeah but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!,Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.,"That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time."
And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.,It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.,"Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!,"I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy. Hank Aaron XXIV.",It's even a crummy hologram.
Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.,Low? It was zero you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.,"Well, I have a low batting average."

I'm walking on sunshine! La la la la sunshine!,What up?,"Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca! Wait! What would the robot do? Frame someone."
What?!,Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own...Philip J. Fry!,I'm acting astonished.
"Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.",Fry you scoundrel!,Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you made one fatal mistake...leaving this confession note.
There you go.,Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials.,"Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself."

"Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK I outwitted you, but--","Oh, you're right, I can't.",Aha! You can't escape it!
I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!,Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness?,"Very well, my friend."

Why isn't this working?!,"But we can use those very gases to save the planet.

May yet? Really?,Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.,So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
So Seymour might still exist?,"Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about.

Then I'm goin' in after him.,Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!,So Seymour might still exist?
He'd come after me.,Stop!,No!
Then all hope is lost. Goodbye Seymour.,Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.,He'd come after me.

Yeah!,OK! Let's clone us some dog!,And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent! Hey where'd everybody go?

Stop the cloning.,Indeed.,15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably added new songs to his repertoire.,"Fry, what's wrong?",Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.,But that's a good thing.

No I'm...doesn't.,I heard alcohol makes you stupid.,We're making beer! I'm the brewery.
The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7!,Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery.,"Oh bother, what have they done now?"
"No, you have a healthy glow.",I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.,More like seven!
I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game. Ooo! I felt that one!,"I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.",Ooo! Let me feel. Have you thought about what to name it?
That's great!,"People, as you know our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us.",You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
We don't work for you anymore!,"Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you this. So I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.",We'll start by slashing salaries. And this time I mean really slash.
Yes sir!,Incoming! We got papers to stuff team! Hup two hup two!,Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
There. One million papers. Folded and loaded!,You rotten kids!,No.
"Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs.",Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at least a week. Oh my God! I think it's time!,There but for the grace of God.
Push Bender push!,"Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs.",Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at least a week. Oh my God! I think it's time!
Almost there. Just two more bottles.,It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed out of me.,You're doing great!
"It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!",Is it OK? I can't hear anything.,Almost there. Just two more bottles.
Hey wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?,We just busted our bums delivering a million newspapers and this is how you greet us? With a bunch of frosty cold beers?,"Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!"
"There's no denying it: The future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out.","Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!","By Eric Horsted Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!","There's no denying it: The future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out.","Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
"So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.",... an extremely dangerous mission ...,There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!,Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!,"Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
We're not listening!,"That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no-one makes you feel guilty because no-one cares.",Sure. You can go to medical school -- If you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!
Anyone who laughs is a Communist!,"In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms!",I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.,Don't mess with Earth!,"You can eat my dog, You can eat my truck, But you eat my flag, And you're outta luck!"
Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?,Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.,They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
"Who are you, old man?",Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.,Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
I'll never remember that.,Name's Old Man Waterfall. But most folks just call me Old Man.,"Who are you, old man?"
"Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!",I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.,The sparks keep me warm.
"You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?","Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!",I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
Ow!,"Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say.","Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know? To become a barber?,"None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. Glob!",What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?
"Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?",I know I am.,"Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless."
"Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed to kill each other just fine.",An idea?,"Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?"
Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--,"Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.","Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
"You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.","Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg. Begin again with the crushing!",Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
"Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.","Hey, I need that to smoke!",All eyes on Zoidberg! Ew!
Over here!,Grab on!,I totally want to!
Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?,What a wonderous affirmation of our love! And all from the touch of your hand.,Oh Amy! You'll be a mother!
Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?,Indeed.,Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.,Call me grandma like crazy! All the time!,Hey! You call her grandma now!
So lets open the gifts!,Also Zoidberg!,Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
Hi!,I am the Grand Midwife.,Smells like a jockstrap.
Congratulations!,I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere but you don't have to talk to me anymore.,Oh thank you!
That's birth for you.,There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.,Way to go squishy!
"Let's see what tools we'll need. Uh-huh, Uh-huh, Uh-huh! Alright, we're all set.",Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap!,"Good news anyone, the Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the supercollider I ordered."
Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.,"Ah, there, finished. And with only six missing pieces!",Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.,"Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor.",Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
There's no bus to Jersey City.,"It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you.",I don't believe that story for a second.
"I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those.",Don't make me hurt you.,Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.,How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?,You're outta the game!
Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.,"Fry, shut up and look at this! May cause superpowers in humans!",Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.
Yup.,"Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?",Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
Check.,Uh-huh. Lickety speed?,Yup.
"Hey Zoidberg, get in here!",Yes sir! Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?,Check.
Nope!,Ain't got that.,"Hey Zoidberg, get in here!"
"Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your biggest fantasy?","Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activity.",Nope!
Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.,To have parents.,"Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your biggest fantasy?"
You'll barely regret this!,"Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!",Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.,It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.,"Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
"Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot.",We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?,"Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd think there'd be a robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever. I have these three costumes you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away."
Captain Yesterday!,A new era of justice has begun.,Listen up New New York! There's a new group of superheros in town! And we're
Wow!,And Superking! The best one of the three!,Clobberella!

From everybody?,Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.,Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -
Give several reasons why.,Especially from everybody.,From everybody?
Or do we...? No I guess not.,"For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued.",Give several reasons why.
And I can't take life anymore.,"Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.","Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!"
Who's the perp?,Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time! We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald!,And I can't take life anymore.
Pack of highly. Got it!,"A dangerous villain know as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly trained animals.",Who's the perp?
"Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.",We're in here too.,Hold the elevator!
That was uncalled for.,"Ah, superheroes! Or should I say superzeroes!",You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper!,You've saved the Gemerald!,I got it I got it! I don't got it!
"Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?",Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.,Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
"But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?",We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!,Save us Leela! I mean...if you don't have anything better to do.
Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!,"Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!","But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.,Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!,Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
"Man, this costume is so damn heavy!",Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.,El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?
Owww! That...didn't hurt.,"Hey Captain Yesterday, can I like, wail on you with this 2x4 and it doesn't hurt you?","Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
So this is your lair?,"Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!",Get 'em!
"OK, take it easy!",Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!,So this is your lair?
That seemed unnecessary.,Hawk! Fetch!,"Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
Oh yeah!,"That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents.",I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
"I guess, as long as you think it's right.",Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?,And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
"My God, he's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.",You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.,"Uh, maybe I should drive."
"Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?","Oh it's 2:30, we can still catch the early bird dinner special.","Yo, Captain Cateracts, what are we doing here?"
Ow! It bit me!,Well I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear powered!,Oh Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants Professor.
Yup.,Right on.,Professor we've talked it over and everyone thinks you're too old.

But your parents are gross sewer mutants.,"Hey, this my chance to spend time with my parents too!",Goodbye Mr Dumbsworth!
"Oh, hello sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um I'm here to pick up your daughter.",I'm getting the doorbell. For me?,"Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?"
Thanks. These aren't pockets they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.,Hi Fry! I like your blazer.,"Oh, hello sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um I'm here to pick up your daughter."
A movie. A movie ma'am.,"So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?",Thanks. These aren't pockets they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat feces.,No I'm not!,OK OK you're the boss!
They're onto me.,Oh so this is the famous Fry! What is he like the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?,"Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry - from the surface!"

I'll miss you Leela. I'll come ack and visit when I'm all grown up.,It is. I know it is.,Well if it's what you really want.
I wanna hear a space story!,There. Todays story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?,I can't see from down here I can't.
"Professy's back! Eww, you smell like smoking. And drinking.",Sup? Kids ready?,"The Fountain Of Aging? Hmm, it is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now it's head of the FBI."

Pretty boy.,"Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched...",So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?
It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.,"...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt.",Pretty boy.
Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.,"No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.","God, you hit a sour note about 200 years back Doug! Let's take it from the top. Ah Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation."
Sure it would. Oh well. Goodbye.,"Hell is full of ten year olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher Mrs Mellenger called stupid fingers. With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle. Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?",Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.
"He is? Great! Wait, what's the catch?","Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.",Sure it would. Oh well. Goodbye.
I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -,"No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe - probably one you've never even met - and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours. It's just the sort of guy I am, what do you say?","He is? Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?,Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.,I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -
Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!,I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!,And here we go!
Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.,Y'know I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.,It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!
How'd you do that?,Oh very well.,Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.,They're very good hands.,How'd you do that?
Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!,"Oh sorry, that'll wear off in a couple of days.",At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
Alrighty!,Neat! Let's see a trick.,Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
Uh-oh.,Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.,Alrighty!
"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.",Hello Fry. Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am. Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.,Where'd I go just now?
Yes you did.,It looks like I wasted a bus trip.,"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
Show him in.,Mr Hedonismbot to see you.,"Only 14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer! Hello? I'll take eight!"
"Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for.","Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams!",Very good sir.
"But, I've never written an opera.",You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would feign commission you write an opera.,"Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for."
But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... OK I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.,"And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success.","But, I've never written an opera."
Leela! You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.,Is it part of the opera?,"A man writing an opera about a woman? Oh sera, how deliciously absurd! I shall see you at the premiere."
So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.,But it's so beautiful.,Leela! You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.
No!,Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully justified prudent fool. They're so cold.,So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
"To win Leela's heart with the holophonor's art,","In good time, you go enjoy the opera.","I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
"Look, what do you want?",Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry.,"Well I don't see any danger,"
"Never! A deal's a deal, Even with a dirty dealer.",I want my hands back.,"Look, what do you want?"
"Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon,","I will marry her now and confine her to hell,","The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,"
No! Stop! Take my hands! You evil metal dork!,"By the power vested in me,",I can't believe everyone is just ad-libbing!
My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?,Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest. The chocolate icing! Oh my!,No! Stop! Take my hands! You evil metal dork!
But I can't play anymore.,"Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera.",Huh?
"Ah! Ooo, ah, whoa, hey!","Yes you can. The beauty was in your heart, not your hands. The music's bad and you should feel bad.",But I can't play anymore.
