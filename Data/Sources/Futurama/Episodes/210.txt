</b>                         It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel 
                         lonely I can just look over at this 
                         disfiguring scar and think of you.

</b>                         Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own 
                         body back.

                         hooked up OK?

</b>                         Seems to be. My neck's just a little 
                         tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. 
                         Thanks for rescuing me last night.

                         out with you.

                         to good old Bender.

                         set us up with bad dates so we'd spend 
                         Valentine's Day together.

                         bunch of stiffs at the bus station and 
                         pocketed our money!

                         Valentine's Day is really all about?
