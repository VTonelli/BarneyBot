               falls onto a car which melts the road and disappears through 
               a hole. The hose stops by a manhole and pumps waste into the

</b>               [Flashbacks. Over the flashbacks Pizzicato Five's Baby Love Child 
               plays. Baby Leela crawls down a corridor at the Orphanarium and 
               nearly falls down the stairs. Her father's arm comes out of the 
               wall and turns her around. Young Leela sits at a desk in her 
               room studying. Her mother's tentacle comes through the toilet 
               and puts a box of cookies on her desk. Leela smiles and eats 
               them. Adolescent Leela walks around New New York on her birthday 
               with no friends. Her mother puts a present on the pavement for 
               her. She reads the message with it: Happy Birthday Leela. Mid-twenties 
               Leela tosses and turns in bed. Her father puts his arm through 
               the laundry chute and pulls the sheet over her. She smiles and 
               goes to sleep.]
