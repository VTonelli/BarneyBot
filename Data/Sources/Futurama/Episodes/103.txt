                         been leaving food around and it's attracting 
                         owls. And I, for one, am getting tired 
                         of cleaning those owl traps.  Now......as 
                         this shocking graph indicates, our water 
                         consumption has tripled in the last 
                         month. I notice Fry has been here for 
                         a month, so I'm appointing him head 
                         of a committee to find who's responsible. 
                         Fry?  Am I cracking up, or is Fry's 
                         living here starting to get in the way
