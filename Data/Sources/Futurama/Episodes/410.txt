                         Now I'm more interested in that new 
                         pizza parlour across the street. Kinda 
                         makes me pine for my days as a pizza 
                         delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd 
                         say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. 
                         And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
