                         planet with it. Did you do that, you 
                         cute little --  Come on. That should 
                         be more than enough fuel to get us outta 
                         here. Bender, pick it up and put it 
                         in the engine.

               floor towards the engine room.]

               forward and the ship lifts off, moments before the ground collapses. 
               They fly away from the planet and it explodes. The crew cheer.]

                         survived.

                         Leela got lucky. That's what I call 
                         a successful mission!

                         not have found love on this mission 
                         but I did find a cute little companion 
                         who excretes starship fuel. And that's 
                         just as good.
