                         to make money from his paper route then 
                         he'd use the money to buy dinner for

                         of performing the reproductive act.

                         robots why should he bother? Why should

                         are all the football stars?  And where

                         of robot lips. All civilisation was 
                         just an effort to impress the opposite 
                         sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now,
