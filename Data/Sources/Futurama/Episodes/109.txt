                         me to inform you that if you can best 
                         me in a fiddle contest, you win back 
                         Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold 
                         fiddle.

</b>                         Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds 
                         of pounds and sound crummy?
