</b>                         Uh, I'm sorta thinking one.  Daddy has 
                         a present for you today. Do you know 
                         what it is?  It's a lucky clover that 
                         can help you be successful at anything 
                         you do - even breakdancing - and it 
                         once belonged to someone very special.
