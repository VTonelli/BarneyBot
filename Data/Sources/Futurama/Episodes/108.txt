                         virus planet.

                         wasteful society in the history of the 
                         galaxy and it was running out of places 
                         to empty its never-ending output of 
                         garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
                         Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
                         of darkness, the city put its garbage 
                         out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
                          The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
                         for 50 years but no country would accept 
                         it. Not even that really filthy one. 
                         You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
                         2052, the city used its mob connections 
                         to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
                         into outer space. Some experts claim

</b>                         And so, on behalf of the entire city, 
                         I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I 
                         now present you with the Academy prize, 
                         which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom 
                         after it became apparent that he was 
                         a jackass.

</b>                         I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it 
                         takes me another hundred years.

                         as well. If not for your 20th century 
                         garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried 
                         under 20th century garbage.

                         to Earth like the first one did?
