                         wedding? And why you have only one eye?

                         back to the castle and wait for me. 
                          She, she's nuts, I can morph into a 
                         5-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry 
                         her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm 
                         really going to marry you.

                         the two way mirror. Can any of you sa
