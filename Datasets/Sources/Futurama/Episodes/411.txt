               chops a tomato like someone would in those sharp knife adverts.

                         Lord! According to the spectrolizer, 
                         Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. 
                         Ordinary water!

</b>                         Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you 
                         was confidence. The confidence to be 
                         your best.

</b>                         Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing 
                         more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.

                         I won fair and square. Now, who wants 
                         brunch? Cooked with plenty of..."confidence"?
