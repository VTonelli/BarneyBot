                         this much on my home planet. Wait a 
                         second! They do! Because this is my 
                         home planet.

                         your dinner: Dr. John Zoidberg!

                         bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?

                         that's a grand old flag!  I wonder what 
                         the Shroud of Turin tastes like.
