               clench his fist but is too weak and his arm falls beside him. 
               He is lying in an old four-poster bed. The room around him is 
               covered in cobwebs and lit by candles. A human butler stands 
               at one side of the bed and a Doctorbot and the Preacherbot stand 
               on the other side. The Doctorbot opens the old robot's chest 
               cabinet and inside a life-support machine beeps and stops. The 
               robot is dead. The Doctorbot closes the robot's eyes.]
