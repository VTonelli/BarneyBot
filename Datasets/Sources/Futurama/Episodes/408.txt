               shakes and the two are thrown to the floor. An alarm wails and 
               two ships fly past and prepare to turn around. Leela gasps.]

</b>               [The two ships look like old fashioned pirate ships and even

                         forever through the void as gravity's 
                         plaything. Oh cruel fate, to be thusly 
                         boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. 
                         It bones for thee. The only thing that 
                         keeps me sane is the thought that I
