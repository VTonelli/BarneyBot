                         to you, blow up my statue!

               foot splits apart. Bender, Leela and Fry run through the hole 
               and past some slaves.]

</b>                         Bender, I understand your desire to 
                         be remembered. But you don't need a 
                         statue for that.

</b>                         No. You have your legacy as a brutal 
                         tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive 
                         any monument.
