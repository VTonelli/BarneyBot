</b>                         Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know 
                         you cared about Nibbler.

</b>                         Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the 
                         little bastard in a sack and toss the 
                         sack in a river and hurl the river into 
                         space. But I do like filling out requisitions 
                         and these were some doozies!  Great 
                         Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. 
                         This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing 
                         licence. And it's mandatory!

                         Ocean. This seems the logical place 
                         for fish to congregate.

                         willing to offer my services as a bait 
                         critic.  These sardines for example 
                         are bland and tasteless.  And these

                         nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's 
                         bigger than anything you've caught.
