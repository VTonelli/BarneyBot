</b>                         Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date 
                         next?

</b>                         Well at least it sounds like you were 
                         able to keep your conciousness seperate 
                         from hers.

                         solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby Tapir! 
                          And that's why I love 'em!
