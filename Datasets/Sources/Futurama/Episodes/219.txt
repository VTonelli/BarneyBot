                         plot to rummage through your underwear. 
                         But once I got in there, I found more 
                         - much more. And now I want to shout 
                         our love from the rooftops. Perhaps 
                         I'll breed some sort of albino shouting 
                         gorilla.

               For the love that I feel

               Just from hearing your name

               And warm as pastrami
