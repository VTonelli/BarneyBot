                         I need to know if it's really me she 
                         loves, or just what you worms have made 
                         of me. That's why with all due respect, 
                         I'm asking you to leave.

</b>                         Listen you, I was born here. I raised 
                         a cloud of children here. My ancestors 
                         came over here on the sandwich.  No 
                         one can make me leave!

               a sword of the wall and begins fighting with the Worm Mayor. 
               The Worm Mayor backs him against an elevator. Fry hits the open 
               button and they both go inside, still fighting.]

               The elevator doors open and the Worm Mayor and Fry continue to 
               fight. Worms head for the fight, drawing their spears. The Worm 
               Mayor grins as Fry is backed up against a nerve. He climbs the 
               nerve and the worms follow him up. Fry reaches the top of the 
               nerve and has nowhere left to go. He hold out his sword.]

               earlier in the day, Fry now plays creepy, unromantic music. The
