</b>                         He's alive!  Bender. What was it like 
                         lying in that hole for a thousand years?

</b>                         I was enjoying it until you guys showed 
                         up.

</b>                         Well, now everything is back as it was. 
                         And if history doesn't care that out 
                         degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather, 
                         then who are we to judge?

               like a spaceship.]

               the ship.]
