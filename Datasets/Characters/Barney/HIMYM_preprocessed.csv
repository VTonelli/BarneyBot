01x01,She hates olives! Awesome!,Marshall
01x01,The olive theory.,Lily
01x01,"The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance .",Ted
01x01,"You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.",Robin
01x01,I can take them off your hands.,Ted
01x01,they're all yours.,Robin
01x01,"Oh, it is on! It is on  till the break of dawn.",Marshall

01x01,"Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch.",Lily
01x01,What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.,Ted
01x01,"Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.",Lily
01x01,"Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I klled you Connor; don't make me get your mom!",Barney
01x01,"Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.",Ted
01x01,"Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP!",Barney
01x01,So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?,Ted
01x01,I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT!,Barney
01x01,She didn't even give me the signal.,Ted

I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.",Ted
01x01,"Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two?",Barney
01x01,I'm doing this.,Ted

01x01,"Oh, um-two blocks  and take a right.",Robin
01x01,". I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.",Ted
01x01,Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.,Robin
01x01,"Oh, I've got references.",Ted

01x01,That was not the signal!,Ted

01x01,... it happens whether you plan it or not. I mean I...,Narrator
01x01,... never thought I'd see that girl again. But it...,Narrator
01x01,"...turns out, I was just too close...",Narrator

01x02,"I suggest we play a little game I like to call, Have you Met Ted?",Barney
01x02,"No, no, no-we're not playing Have you Met Ted!",Ted
01x02,"So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy... but after just one date, I was in love with her, which made me say something stupid",Narrator
01x02,I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
01x02,What?,Robin
01x02,"Oh, Dad.",Daughter
01x02,So then what happened?,Son
01x02,"Nothing. I mean, I made a complete fool of myself. So... a week went by and I decided not to call her.",Narrator
01x02,"So you're not goanna call her? You went from, I think I'm in love with you to I'm not gonna call her?",Marshall
01x02,"I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.  Robin!",Ted

01x02,"Lily, you squeaked?",Ted
01x02,"She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.",Ted
01x02,Fine!,Lily
01x02,So what do we think of Ted?,Lily
01x02,Ted's something else.,Robin

01x02,Comes on a little strong.,Robin
01x02,But...that's part of my charm.,Ted
01x02,But that's part of his charm.,Lily
01x02,"Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?",Robin
01x02,Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.,Lily
01x02,Oops...,Lily
01x02,"She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the happily ever after thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.",Ted
01x02,So're you gonna ask her out?,Marshall
01x02,"Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out?",Ted
01x02,Did you guys get high?,Lily
01x02,I got it! I don't ask her out... I invite her to our party next Friday.,Ted
01x02,We're having a party next Friday?,Marshall
01x02,We are now-Casual,Ted

01x02,You waited five minutes to tell me that?,Lily
01x02,Alright-so call her up!,Marshall
01x02,No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a chance encounter.,Ted
01x02,"that's great, Ted. You'll be the most Casual stalker ever.",Lily

01x03,"No, I'm not.",Ted
01x03,"Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness.

01x04,"Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person.  It's the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling?",Marshall

01x04,"Whoa!! OH! Oh, my god! I'm covered in horse crap! It's in my hair!! Oh my, ow... ow my knee.",Robin
01x04,You planned that?,Marshall
01x04,"No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams",Barney
01x04,"So, if you ever come to Alabama, my mom throws these huge crawfish boils and she's just dying to meet you, by the way.",Natalie
01x04,"Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say and there's no good way to say it. I wanna break up. I don't think you're the one for me. I don't want to waste your time because I really like you. I wanna do right by you, and I think the best way to do that is just to be honest. I'm sorry.  Aah!",Ted
01x04,I'm not the one for you?,Natalie
01x04,I'm sorry. I just thought the mature thing to do would be...,Ted
01x04,It's my birthday!,Natalie
01x04,"Yes, I know I didn't realize that it was...",Ted
01x04,It's my birthday and you're telling me I'm not the one for you?,Natalie
01x04,It's really not such a big deal. I mean it's the odds. It's like you lost the lottery.,Ted
01x04,"Oh, so dating you is like winning the lottery?",Natalie
01x04,"No, no, no. I didn't mean that.",Ted
01x04,"Okay, So what's the problem?",Natalie
01x04,It's... I can't explain it.,Ted
01x04,TRY!,Natalie
01x04,It's... ineffable.,Ted
01x04,I'm not F-able?,Natalie
01x04,"No, no, no, no. Ineffable, ineffable means it can't be explained.",Ted
01x04,"Oh, so I'm stupid?",Natalie
01x04,"Oh, god what's going on?",Ted
01x04,"Okay, what's going on is, you broke my heart over my answering machine... on my birthday, waited three years for me to get over you. Tracked me down, begged me to go out with you again only so you could dump me three weeks later. Again on my birthday!",Natalie
01x04,"No, it's... it's not like that. I'm just... it's, it's, it's.",Ted
01x04,WHAAAT!?,Natalie
01x04,I'm just like super busy right now.,Ted
01x04,Remember when Natalie said.,Narrator
01x04,I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.,Natalie
01x04,Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga. It's a form of gorilla street fighting developed by the Israeli army.,Narrator
01x04,This is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar.,Waiter
01x04,My knee!,Guy 1
01x04,It's in my hair!,Guy 2
01x04,But isn't it nice to know that people are watching?,Barney
01x04,"Oh, my god. Are you alright?",Marshall
01x04,What happened to you?,Lily
01x04,"Told the truth, turns out the truth has a mean round house kick.",Ted
01x04,"Oh, man.",Marshall
01x04,"Oh, well you did the right thing. I'm proud of you.",Lily
01x04,I'm bleeding internally.,Ted
01x04,"Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down? Other people's misfortune. You missed something so amazing.",Barney
01x04,Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?,Robin
01x04,Fine.,Barney
01x04,Are you okay?,Lily
01x04,"I really thought I was going the good way this time. I guess there is no good way. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you just end up flat on your back flailing around in a big pile of horse crap!",Ted
01x04,You saw it?,Robin
01x04,"It's going against the internet now! It's okay, grow up.",Ted
01x04,And that's how it ended with Natalie. No happily ever after. Just a whole lot of hurt. And just like that all those wonderful memories were replaced. By this one,Narrator
01x04,"But you know, bad as that night was... within a year Natalie was married. With three beautiful children. So that's the up side of her. Sometimes it happens for a reason.",Narrator
01x04,"Wow, so you beat up by a girl?",Son
01x04,Is that all you're taking away from this story?,Narrator
01x04,You got beat up by a girl?,Son
01x04,"Hey, she knew Krav Maga.",Narrator
01x05,"So kids, would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf?",Narrator
01x05,Why does he even ask?,Son
01x05,"I know, he's just going to tell us anyway.",Daughter
01x05,I sure am. It all began.,Narrator
01x05,When Robin strolled into the bar and said.,Narrator
01x05,Say you're my bitch.,Robin
01x05,I'm your bitch. Why this time?,Ted
01x05,"Because tonight, I am getting us all into Okay.",Robin
01x05,Okay!? Awesome!!,Barney
01x05,"What's going on, did I just have a stroke?",Ted
01x05,"Okay is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in.",Barney
01x05,A friend of yours named you?,Ted
01x05,"No... a friend of mine named, shut up.",Barney
01x05,"Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight.",Robin
01x05,"Nice going, Scherbatsky. You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.",Ted
01x05,He's even getting me into the VIP room.,Robin
01x05,"Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean...",Barney
01x05,"Okay, what does VIP stand for in your universe?",Robin
01x05,... I know that the P is pen1s.,Barney
01x05,"Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily?",Robin
01x05,Why was this funny? I'll explain. You see.,Narrator
01x05,"Lily was a kindergarten teacher. And so, one fateful naptime...",Narrator
01x05,Austin and I spent Saturday night at the most charming bed and breakfast. It was so nice. What did you do this weekend?,Claire

01x05,TEN SECONDS!!,Marshall
01x05,SUCK IT LOSERS!,Lily
01x05,"You know, quiet time with the fianc.",Lily
01x05,"I don't know, I just felt embarrassed. Claire is my age, and she and her husband do all these classy grownup stuff. Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.",Lily
01x05,That was some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.,Marshall
01x05,"Yeah, but it wasn't classy. Maybe we should have a wine tasting party.",Lily
01x05,"I like wine. I like tasting. You know I can party, let's do it. Let's rock it, maturity style!",Marshall
01x05,"Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...",Ted
01x05,All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from.,Barney
01x05,"So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this.",Ted
01x05,"Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story: my friend Kelly's going to be there.",Robin
01x05,"Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love?",Ted
01x05,"Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.",Robin
01x05,"Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.",Barney
01x05,"Oh, and she's totally hot.",Robin
01x05,"Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.",Ted
01x05,"So, do you have any other hot single fr...",Barney
01x05,"No, Kelly works with the news breakers...",Robin
01x05,"Oh, no, Ted, your blazer!",Lily
01x05,"What, what, what...?",Ted
01x05,Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it. Love it!,Lily
01x05,Thank you.,Ted
01x05,And his hair was perfect.,Barney
01x05,"Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours.",Lily
01x05,"One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?",Barney
01x05,"Alright, Tin-Man. Let's hit it.",Ted
01x05,"Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.",Marshall
01x05,What the hell happened to these two?,Barney
01x05,Marshall and I are just growing up.,Lily
01x05,"Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses...",Marshall
01x05,"Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay.",Barney
01x05,"Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up.",Ted
01x05,"My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she's mine.",Barney
01x05,Do strategies ever work for you?,Ted
01x05,Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's about half the time.,Barney
01x05,We'll wait here...,Bradley
01x05,"...And with todays interest rate climbing, you gotta go for the thirty year fixed mortgage.",Chris
01x05,"Oh, totally.  So, Marshall, what about you? You guys thinking house, baby?",Austin
01x05,Ah!,Claire
01x05,"Ah, no I think we're going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff, but they make you old. Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot...forever.",Marshall
01x05,I'm three month's pregnant.,Claire
01x05,I don't know guys. It's not awkward unless we let it be awkward.,Marshall
01x05,This place seems great. Is Kelly here?,Ted
01x05,"Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't?",Robin
01x05,Can we come?,Ted
01x05,It's... not that arbitrary...,Robin
01x05,Whoa... this place in lourd!,Ted
01x05,You think?,Barney
01x05,"Okay, it's a little loud.",Barney
01x05,You want to go somewhere we can talk?,Ted
01x05,...Okay...,Ted
01x05,You think it was kind of weird that Ted didn't invite me out with him?,Marshall
01x05,"Why, you'd rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty with the...",Lily
01x05,Is this what you want?,Marshall
01x05,Let's start drinking!,Lily
01x05,"Oh, not so fast. In order for the tannins to mellow, you should let it breathe for about thirty minutes.",Chris
01x05,Freaking ten ends.,Marshall
01x05,"So, how do you know Robin?",Ted
01x05,Sagittarius.,Kelly
01x05,Is that near Westchester?,Ted
01x05,You know what they're doing in there right now? They're watching Claire's ultrasound video and I swear to god even the baby looks bored.,Marshall
01x05,"Come on, it's not that bad. We're really starting to click with these guys. Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night.",Lily
01x05,You're also trying to get me excited about fondue?,Marshall
01x05,"It's dipping stuff in hot cheese, what's not to love?",Lily
01x05,"Okay, that does sound good. But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.",Marshall
01x05,"Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.",Lily
01x05,Marshall knew she was right. He had to stop acting like a kid.,Narrator
01x05,"But not tonight. Now our apartment was on the third floor, so I'm not sure if this part is actually true, but Uncle Marshall swears it happened.",Narrator
01x05,Taxi!,Marshall

01x05,Please tell me we can drink the wine now.,Lily
01x05,"Five more minutes, we don't want to rush to tannins.",Chris
01x05,Freaking tannins.,Lily
01x05,"I think that's when I realized, clubs weren't awesome. Clubs weren't even okay. Clubs sucked. I had to get out of there.",Narrator
01x05,"Hey, Robin.",Marshall
01x05,Hey!,Robin
01x05,Why aren't you inside?,Marshall
01x05,"I'm calling the owner, there's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here?",Robin
01x05,"Oh, I had this move. So I came here to bust it. Can you get me in?",Marshall
01x05,"Great, voicemail.",Robin

01x05,"Name's already crossed off, sorry.",Doorman 2
01x05,"But, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I'm a reporter for channel one.",Robin
01x05,There's a channel one? Back of the line!,Doorman 2

01x05,"Aah! Coat wench do not uncheck that man's jacket. Sorry, just being dramatic. You're not a wench.",Marshall
01x05,"No, no, no. Coat wench, I like it. I should get a sign made of it.",Coat Check Girl
01x05,What are you doing here? Lily let you go?,Ted
01x05,Lily? Pfft. Who cares right?,Marshall
01x05,You are so dead.,Ted
01x05,"Oh, I'm so dead.",Marshall
01x05,Wow. Uh... I'm going home.,Ted

01x05,"Alright, one beer.",Ted
01x05,"Yes, finally I don't have to wait half an hour for a drink.",Marshall
01x05,Yeah. No tannins.,Marshall
01x05,"Oh man, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this. This is important to the story. Earlier that day, Marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in. Okay, so anyway.",Narrator
01x05,"Marshall, are you okay?",Lily
01x05,"Again, I wasn't there. So I'm a little foggy on the details.",Narrator
01x05,Taxi!,Lily
01x05,Hey.,Lily
01x05,Hey.,Robin
01x05,Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there? I kind of need to kll him.,Lily
01x05,"Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter.",Robin
01x05,Know something; I'd take a pee in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day.,Lily
01x05,Broke my tooth.,Marshall
01x05,...Do you have...,Marshall
01x05,...any aspirin?,Marshall
01x05,Maybe theres...,Barney
01x05,a machine in...,Barney
01x05,The restroom.,Barney
01x05,"Now to this day, I don't know what happened in there. But when Marshall came out a few minutes later,",Narrator
01x05,Rough night?,Coat Check Girl
01x05,"Yeah, these clubs are supposed to be fun, right? Why do I hate them so much?",Ted
01x05,Because all of the stuff you're supposed to like... usually sucks. Like these clubs or cruises.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,Or New Year's Eve.,Ted
01x05,Or the Super Bowl.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,Or parades.,Ted
01x05,The rockettes.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,Or parades.,Ted
01x05,You said that already.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,I really hate parades.,Ted
01x05,"He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don't do that. Unless, of course, you're chasing after someone who's already done it, and then I think it's okay.",Lily
01x05,"Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?",Robin
01x05,Don't check your email.,Lily
01x05,Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.,Robin
01x05,"Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward.",Lily
01x05,"Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?",Robin
01x05,I want to go into this club and find my fianc.,Lily
01x05,Well that you can't do.,Robin
01x05,Wanna bet?  I said follow my lead.,Lily
01x05,Follow my lead.,Phil
01x05,"Please, please, please.",Bradley
01x05,Those were the four greatest and only breasts I have ever seen.,Bradley
01x05,"Yeah, see, everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun, it's usually not.",Coat Check Girl
01x05,Right.,Ted
01x05,Right!,Coat Check Girl
01x05,"So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date.",Ted
01x05,Then we couldn't go anywhere that's supposed to be fun.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,Right. The DMV it is.,Ted
01x05,Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,"Sounds awful, it's a date.",Ted
01x05,Okay.,Coat Check Girl
01x05,But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.,Ted
01x05,How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once?,Ted
01x05,"Okay, this question is for the wedge.",Chris
01x05,Barney??,Woman
01x05,Barney.,Ted
01x05,"Ted, bring your coat, we're leaving.",Barney
01x05,"What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?",Ted
01x05,"That was my cousin, Leslie.",Barney
01x05,What?!,Ted
01x05,"No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise",Barney
01x05,"Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney.",Ted
01x05,"Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so...",Barney
01x05,"Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night...",Ted
01x05,FINE! Just... eh.,Barney
01x05,That's a handy new trick.,Ted
01x05,"So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth. It was nice, and then it got icky.",Narrator
01x05,Eww.,Barney
01x05,I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT.,Ted
01x05,I MEAN I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE I GOT ENGAGED BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO BE ASKED.,Marshall
01x05,"I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...",Ted
01x05,THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT.,Barney
01x05,--HAD OTHER PLANS. I MEAN LATELY...,Ted
01x05,"I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY.",Marshall
01x05,WHAT?,Barney
01x05,YOU CRAZY? YOU THINK I LIKE GOING TO THOSE CLUBS? I'D SO MUCH RATHER GO TO YOUR FRUITY LITTLE WINE TASTING.,Ted
01x05,"Oh, my god...I'm going to barf. Where's my purse, where's my purse?  I'm okay.",Lily
01x05,PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.,Ted
01x05,WHAT?,Barney
01x05,"BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS.",Ted
01x05,IT'S A PLAN! HEY MAYBE IT'LL BE THAT CUTE COAT CHECK GIRL!,Marshall
01x05,"YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL BE.",Ted
01x05,It wasn't.,Narrator
01x05,"YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY...",Marshall
01x05,THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!,Barney
01x06,"You know how Aunt Robin's a big fan of Halloween, always dressing up in crazy costumes? Well, she wasn't always that way. Back in 2005, she thought she was too cool for Halloween, unlike Aunt Lily.",Future Ted
01x06,Guess what came in the mail today?,Lily
01x06,Our costumes? Do they rule?,Marshall
01x06,They rule. And yours is 100 wool so you won't get hypothermia like last year.,Lily
01x06,Tarzan nipple blue.,Marshall
01x06,"You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse...",Barney
01x06,"Wow, we get it.",Lily 
01x06,She's a slutty nurse.,Barney
01x06,"Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?",Marshall
01x06,"Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.",Robin
01x06,Mike? There's a Mike? You have a boyfriend? You haven't told us?,Lily
01x06,"No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.",Robin

01x06,How about we go about a Halloween double-date?,Lily
01x06,"I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.",Robin
01x06,"Come on, Robin, trot our your new fella. Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.",Lily
01x06,"Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened?",Marshall

01x06,That's right.,Ted
01x06,What's the Slutty Pumpkin?,Robin
01x06,"You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago.",Ted
01x06,I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.,Ted
01x06,"Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?",Robin
01x06,It was carved in strategic places.,Ted
01x06,"So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...",Ted
01x06,Kahlua and root beer,Lily
01x06,A cocktail she invented herself.,Marshall
01x06,And she...,Ted
01x06,And she called it the Tootsie Roll.,Barney
01x06,Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.,Barney

01x06,Something went terribly wrong.,Barney
01x06,Guys! Something went terribly wrong.,Ted

01x06,"Sonny, where's Cher?",Ted
01x06,Cher?,Lily
01x06,"Right here, babe.",Marshall
01x06,I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.,Ted
01x06,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks?,Marshall
01x06,Loves them.,Ted
01x06,Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.,Marshall
01x06,"Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.",Ted
01x06,"Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve.",Marshall
01x06,"Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.",Ted
01x06,"I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here.",Lily
01x06,"No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?",Ted

01x06,Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!,Ted
01x06,"Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.",Ted
01x06,"You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.",Barney
01x06,"I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.",Ted
01x06,"OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?",Ted
01x06,"Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.",Lily
01x06,Can't wait.,Ted
01x06,"So, what do you think?",Marshall
01x06,"Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner?",Ted
01x06,"Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right?",Marshall
01x06,We are so gonna win the costume contest this year.,Lily
01x06,"First prize, 50 gift certificate at the bar.",Marshall

01x06,"Well, I think you guys look great.",Ted
01x06,"What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask.",Lily
01x06,"Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad.",Ted
01x06,What? She thought it was hilarious.,Ted
01x06,"Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.",Lily
01x06,What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.,Marshall
01x06,"All right, Polly gotta pee.",Lily
01x06,Again?,Marshall
01x06,Where are you going?,Ted
01x06,It's an elaborate costume.,Marshall
01x06,"No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!",Barney
01x06,No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.,Ted
01x06,"Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.",Barney
01x06,"We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.",Ted
01x06,"Hm,  Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.",Barney
01x06,I'm heading up to the roof.,Ted
01x06,"Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice.  We out.",Barney
01x06,"Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?",Robin
01x06,"Hey, word play. Funny.",Ted
01x06,Whoo.,Robin
01x06,Nice outfit.,Robin
01x06,I'm a parrot.,Lily
01x06,You sure are.,Robin
01x06,Where's Mike?,Lily
01x06,He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year.,Robin
01x06,"Seriously, does my eye liner look OK?",Marshall
01x06,"Yes, it's weirdly hot.",Lily
01x06,"So, where's your costume?",Lily 
01x06,"Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up.",Robin
01x06,"Oh, geez.",Robin
01x06,Hi.,Mike
01x06,"Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair.",Robin
01x06,"Where's your costume, Gretel?",Mike
01x06,"You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.",Robin
01x06,I think we got them beat.,Marshall 
01x06,I can't believe you talked me into this.,Barney
01x06,I didn't. You followed me up here.,Ted
01x06,This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.,Barney
01x06,There are six chicks here.,Barney
01x06,"Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better.",Ted
01x06,"Ladies and gentlemen, as on-pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95, it's my pleasure to welcome back the Shagarats.",King Costume Guy

01x06,Starrr-ving,Marshall 
01x06,"It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.",Lily
01x06,"Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's",Mike
01x06,This cheeseburger is so...,Robin
01x06,Good. See.,Mike
01x06,"I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop.",Lily
01x06,That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit.,Marshall
01x06,"Robin, you have to try this chicken.",Mike
01x06,"Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks.",Robin
01x06,Really tasty.,Mike
01x06,I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.,Robin
01x06,"Come on, just try a little bite.",Mike
01x06,"Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.",Robin
01x06,Oh for God's sake.,Lily
01x06,Really tasty.,Lily
01x06,Hey.,Barney
01x06,Hey.,Hula Girl
01x06,"So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah.",Barney
01x06,"Right, cuz I'm wearing a lei.",Hula Girl
01x06,It isn't funny if you explain the joke.,Barney
01x06,Let's bail.,Barney
01x06,"Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.",Ted
01x06,Name one person you know at this party.,Barney
01x06,"Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?",Ted
01x06,"OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle.",Barney
01x06,Really? That's the nickname now?,Ted
01x06,"Yeah, the Barnacle.",Barney
01x06,The Barnacle.,Ted
01x06,That's it. Barnacle out.,Barney
01x06,"Have fun, Barnacle.",Ted
01x06,"So, do you like Mike?",Robin
01x06,Do you like Mike?,Lily
01x06,Of course I do. Why?,Robin
01x06,It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume.,Lily
01x06,"Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.",Robin
01x06,"OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it.",Lily
01x06,Are you trying to get me to join a cult?,Robin
01x06,"Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.",Lily
01x06,What?,Robin
01x06,"Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night.",Lily
01x06,"OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?",Robin
01x06,How about you start by sharing dessert.,Lily
01x06,"I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.",Robin
01x06,"Barney. What, you're back?",Ted
01x06,That's right.,Barney
01x06,In a totally new costume.,Ted
01x06,"Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.",Barney
01x06,What's with the face?,Barney
01x06,"It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.",Ted
01x06,So go to the bathroom.,Barney
01x06,"No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.",Ted
01x06,"So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.",Barney
01x06,"Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there.",Angel Guy
01x06,"Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there.",Barney
01x06,"Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?",Angel Guy
01x06,"A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down.",Robin
01x06,This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours.,Marshall
01x06,Take the damn picture.,Lily
01x06,Got it.,Robin
01x06,I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time.,Marshall
01x06,"Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing.",Robin
01x06,"But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.",Robin
01x06,"Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad.",Marshall
01x06,"Thanks, Marshmallow.",Lily
01x06,"Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.",Robin
01x06,Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.,Barney
01x06,You wouldn't believe.,Hula Girl
01x06,I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink.,Barney
01x06,You certainly are a charming devil.,Hula Girl
01x06,I'm also a horny devil.  Yeah.,Barney
01x06,No.,Hula Girl
01x06,"Oh, go to hell.",Barney
01x06,"You know, if you guys like tiramisu we found this little Italian place...",Mike
01x06,"No, you found it. I came with you. Go on.",Robin
01x06,I'm just saying we love tiramisu.,Mike
01x06,I cannot get enough of it.,Robin
01x06,We're crazy for this stuff.,Mike
01x06,I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu.,Robin
01x06,We love tiramisu. Am I wrong in saying that.?,Mike
01x06,"No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?",Robin
01x06,So this Italian place? How's their cannoli?,Marshall
01x06,"See there, hungry.",Robin
01x06,"Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.",Mike
01x06,"Hey, is that Gary Oldman?",Robin
01x06,"Wait, where?",Mike
01x06,I don't see...,Mike
01x06,Brain freeze.,Robin
01x06,OK Victoria's Secret party right now.,Barney
01x06,Nope.,Ted
01x06,"Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.",Barney
01x06,She might.,Ted
01x06,Oy.,Barney
01x06,"Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.",Ted
01x06,Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!,Barney
01x06,See ya.,Ted
01x06,"No, see ya.  Ow.",Barney
01x06,Wanna drink the melty part?,Robin
01x06,"You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna take off.",Mike
01x06,"Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel",Robin
01x06,"Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.",Mike
01x06,I like being with you.,Robin
01x06,"Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.",Mike
01x06,"Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.",Robin
01x06,"Actually, it kinda does.",Mike
01x06,"Wait, are we breaking up?",Robin
01x06,We aren't breaking up. I'm breaking up with you.,Mike
01x06,And then just when I was about to lose hope.,Future Ted VO
01x06,She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.,Ted
01x06,"Kahlua, root beer, could this penguin be the Slutty Pumpkin?",Future Ted VO
01x06,"Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...",Ted
01x06,"You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.",Barney
01x06,Unbelievable.,Ted
01x06,"Yes, it is.",Barney
01x06,Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.,Hula Girl
01x06,"What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot",Barney
01x06,I cannot believe I gave you my number,Hula Girl
01x06,"Yeah, well, you did, thanks.",Barney
01x06,"Well, give it back.",Hula girl
01x06,"Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.",Barney
01x06,But I'm never gonna go out with you.,Hula Girl
01x06,But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.,Barney
01x06,Nice.,Ted
01x06,"Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.",Barney
01x06,I'm staying.,Ted
01x06,Fine. Fine.,Barney
01x06,What are you doing?,Ted
01x06,I'm flippering you off.,Barney
01x06,"Sweetie, I'm so sorry.",Lily
01x06,"Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.",Robin
01x06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.",Carl
01x06,Oh yeah!,Marshall
01x06,Wait. What did he say?,Marshall
01x06,"Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!",Lily
01x06,"Gay pirate, where are you getting that from?",Marshall
01x06,"Dude, you're wearing eye liner.",Carl
01x06,"OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have sx with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won!",Marshall
01x06,"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
01x06,"I love you too, Lilypad.",Marshall
01x06,"You guys, let me get a picture.",Robin
01x06,I had a feeling I'd find you here.,Robin
01x06,"Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.",Ted
01x06,I never played any team sports,Robin
01x06,Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.,Ted
01x06,I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.,Robin
01x06,"Man, that sucks.",Ted
01x06,"Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?",Robin
01x06,"No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.",Ted
01x06,But you're wired just fine.,Ted
01x06,"Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?",Robin
01x06,Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.,Ted
01x06,Really?,Robin
01x06,"Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin.  pumpkin-pumpkin...",Ted
01x06,"How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.",Robin
01x06,"Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.",Ted
01x06,Scoot.,Robin
01x07,"Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science.",Future Ted
01x07,"Wow, that was a great story, Dad.",Daughter
01x07,We're gonna go watch TV.,Son
01x07,"You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary.",Future Ted
01x07,Oh my God.,Marshall
01x07,"I know, I'm still shaking.",Lily
01x07,"What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.",Barney
01x07,Are you guys OK? Marshall : Another round and back it up for me and Lily.,Robin
01x07,What happened?,Ted
01x07,"We saw something, up in the apartment.",Marshall
01x07,Something bad.,Lily
01x07,"I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.",Marshall
01x07,"Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.",Lily
01x07,Oh my God.,Lily
01x07,What was it?,Ted
01x07,"Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.",Marshall
01x07,"Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.",Lily
01x07,"Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.",Marshall
01x07,"But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae",Lily
01x07,Marshall ran away from a cockroach.,Barney
01x07,"It, it was a mouse.",Marshall
01x07,"Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.",Barney
01x07,"Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.",Robin
01x07,"I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100 success rate. What's your secret?",Robin
01x07,"Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.",Ellen
01x07,"Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...",Robin
01x07,Was that chick at the end really a client?,Barney
01x07,Yes.,Robin
01x07,We're signing up.,Barney
01x07,What?,Ted
01x07,"Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.",Barney
01x07,I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.,Ted
01x07,"No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.",Marshall
01x07,It was a cockroach.,Lily
01x07,"Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just klled.",Marshall
01x07,Oh my God.,Lily
01x07,Come on.,Barney
01x07,"Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.",Barney
01x07,What?,Ted
01x07,My boat is sinking.,Barney
01x07,You have a boat?,Ted
01x07,Your boat is sinking. That was good.,Ted
01x07,"Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again.",Barney
01x07,"All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.",Ellen
01x07,"Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless sx.",Barney
01x07,You deserve more.,Ellen
01x07,"That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.",Barney
01x07,"Oh, of course you can. That is so...",Ellen
01x07,"It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?",Barney
01x07,Get out.,Ellen
01x07,What?,Barney
01x07,"I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.",Ellen
01x07,"Oh my God, people do that.",Barney
01x07,You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?,Ellen
01x07,What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?,Barney
01x07,That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.,Ellen
01x07,"OK, Ted, let's go.",Barney
01x07,"Not you, you stay.",Ellen
01x07,"You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.",Ellen
01x07,It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.',Barney
01x07,Get outta here!,Ellen
01x07,You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.,Ellen
01x07,"Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.",Ted
01x07,"Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait",Ellen
01x07,"That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?",Ted
01x07,"There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.",Ellen
01x07,Do you take credit cards?,Ted
01x07,"OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.",Lily
01x07,"Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.",Barney
01x07,It's bigger now. It's been feeding.,Marshall
01x07,We were just upstairs watching TV.,Lily
01x07,Ah gosh.,Marshall
01x07,"OK, let's do this.",Lily
01x07,"Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.",Marshall
01x07,So did you get a good look at it?,Barney
01x07,"Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...",Lily
01x07,"But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.",Marshall
01x07,"So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?",Robin
01x07,It's a cockamouse.,Lily
01x07,What?,Robin
01x07,It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...,Lily
01x07,Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?,Barney
01x07,That's impossible. That simply can't happen.,Robin
01x07,"Oh, but it can.",Lily
01x07,And it has,Marshall
01x07,And it's pissed.,Lily
01x07,"Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.",Ted
01x07,There was no time.,Marshall
01x07,"So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?",Robin
01x07,She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?,Ted
01x07,"Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.",Lily
01x07,Did you just use my name as a verb?,Ted
01x07,"Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when",Barney
01x07,"OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.",Ted
01x07,"Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.",Ted
01x07,"Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.",Ellen
01x07,You said it was gonna be three days.,Ted
01x07,Did I?,Ellen
01x07,Hm.,Ted
01x07,Three days? Really?,Ellen
01x07,"Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",Ted
01x07,"How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.",Ellen
01x07,There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.,Ted
01x07,I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.,Ellen
01x07,"But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",Ted
01x07,How do you think I feel? I have a 100 success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.,Ellen
01x07,"Well, I'm not.",Ted
01x07,A little bi maybe?,Ellen
01x07,"No. You're messing with me, right?",Ted
01x07,Come see for yourself.,Ellen
01x07,"I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...",Ellen
01x07,There's a 9.6 right there.,Ted
01x07,"Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.",Ellen
01x07,What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?,Ted
01x07,8.5.,Ellen
01x07,So he sucks.,Ted
01x07,"No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.",Ellen
01x07,"Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",Ted
01x07,"Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.",Ellen
01x07,He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.,Lily
01x07,And it's the size of a potato.,Marshall
01x07,"So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",Robin
01x07,Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.,Marshall
01x07,"My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",Ted
01x07,"Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",Barney
01x07,And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.,Marshall
01x07,Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.,Lily
01x07,"For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",Marshall
01x07,"Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",Robin
01x07,So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?,Marshall
01x07,"Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",Robin
01x07,"If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",Marshall
01x07,"It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",Marshall
01x07,"OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",Ted
01x07,You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.,Barney
01x07,"All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45 better, who am I to deny her that?",Ted
01x07,"That's right, I did the math.",Future Ted VO
01x07,Hi.,Ted
01x07,"Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.",Sarah
01x07,I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.,Ted
01x07,"Hi, I'm Ted.",Ted
01x07,"So, what are we doing today?",Sarah
01x07,I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.,Ted
01x07,I'm exactly the same.,Sarah
01x07,"Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.",Ted 
01x07,Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.,Sarah 
01x07,"Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",Ted
01x07,"Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",Ted
01x07,I love brunch.,Sarah
01x07,"It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",Ted
01x07,"I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.",Sarah
01x07,"Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
01x07,"Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.",Sarah
01x07,Friday night?,Ted
01x07,"Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",Ted
01x07,Thank you.,Sarah
01x07,I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?,Ted
01x07,Only a little.,Sarah
01x07,"Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",Ted
01x07,"OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.",Sarah
01x07,I'm sure you do.,Ted
01x07,"Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",Robin
01x07,"OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",Lily
01x07,"Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",Marshall
01x07,Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.,Robin
01x07,Aliens.,Marshall
01x07,"Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.",Marshall
01x07,You can't be serious.,Robin
01x07,"My friend, you just poked the bear.",Marshall
01x07,"So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.",Ted
01x07,Oh.,Robin
01x07,"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.",Lily
01x07,"Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...",Ted
01x07,"Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.",Lily
01x07,"Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.",Barney
01x07,"On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.",Marshall
01x07,Oh geez.,Robin
01x07,"Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.",Marshall
01x07,What?,Ted
01x07,"When suddenly, an array of",Marshall
01x07,"Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.",Sarah 
01x07,The doctor will see you now.,Barney
01x07,"What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",Ted
01x07,Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.,Lily
01x07,"Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",Ted
01x07,Happy ending.,Barney
01x07,"Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.",Ted
01x07,"All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",Barney
01x07,"Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",Lily
01x07,"Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",Barney
01x07,Oh my God!,Marshall
01x07,Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?,Lily
01x07,"Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",Marshall
01x07,"Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?",Lily
01x07,Hello again.,Ted
01x07,I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.,Sarah
01x07,"Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",Ted
01x07,You have a basal cell carcinoma.,Sarah
01x07,Anything else?,Ted
01x07,"Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.",Sarah
01x07,"Wait, then you're still getting married.",Ted
01x07,Of course I'm still getting married.,Sarah
01x07,But we're a 9.6.,Ted
01x07,Excuse me.,Sarah
01x07,"OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.",Ted
01x07,You looked at my file.,Sarah
01x07,I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fianc thinks we're a better match.,Ted
01x07,I am getting married on Saturday.,Sarah
01x07,Summer breeze...,Ted 
01x07,Ted.,Sarah
01x07,"Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",Ted
01x07,Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?,Sarah
01x07,"See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",Ted
01x07,"Ted, just calm down.",Sarah
01x07,Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.,Ted
01x07,"Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.",Sarah
01x07,"Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",Ted
01x07,"Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.",Sarah
01x07,You're right.,Ted
01x07,"If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.",Sudeep
01x07,"Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.",Marshall
01x07,"You bstrd, I actually got excited about this.",Sudeep
01x07,What?,Marshall
01x07,It's empty.,Sudeep
01x07,"Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.",Marshall
01x07,Robin.,Lily
01x07,What?,Robin
01x07,Oh my God. It's real.,Robin
01x07,"Oh, is it? Do something.",Lily
01x07,What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?,Lily
01x07,It was the only think I could think of.,Robin
01x07,Lily thank God.,Marshall
01x07,"Lily, I love you.",Marshall
01x07,"Robin, open the window!",Marshall
01x07,It can fly.,Robin
01x07,Wow.,"Lily, Marshall"
01x07,"Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private wr of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.",Marshall
01x07,Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.,Ted
01x07,"I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this trnsvstite hooker said he she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his her favorite movie was Say Anything.",Ellen
01x07,"Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit clich?",Ted
01x07,It's for the bourbon.,Ellen
01x07,This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.,Ted
01x07,"No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.",Ellen
01x07,"I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.",Ted
01x07,"No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.",Ellen
01x07,You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.,Ted
01x07,No you won't.,Ellen
01x07,Yes I will,Ted
01x07,"How do you know? Ted: I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I.",Ellen
01x07,You're losing me.,Ellen
01x07,"Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.",Ted
01x07,So I should keep looking?,Ellen
01x07,Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.,Ted
01x08,"So kids, there are many buildings New York City.",Future Ted
01x08,"Thousands of apartments. Millions of stories. And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now, there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment. I have so many great memories of that place.",Future Ted
01x08,Marshall playing video games.,Future Ted VO
01x08,Lily painting on the fire escape.,Future Ted VO
01x08,Hey!,Mr. Madsen
01x08,"Sorry, Mr. Madsen.",Lily
01x08,"And me making the coffee. I had this coffeepot that was probably 50 years old at that time, and it made truly terrible coffee. We called it Shocky",Future Ted VO
01x08,Plugging in.,Ted
01x08,Saving game.,Marshall
01x08,I loved every last detail of that place. Right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall. I never wanted any of it to change. But that's not how life works.,Future Ted VO
01x08,You guys will never believe what just happened to us.,Lily
01x08,I don't even believe it myself.,Robin
01x08,We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment.,Lily
01x08,"Wait, her apartment? I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.",Daughter
01x08,I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.,Lily
01x08,When was the last time you were there?,Robin
01x08,Three months ago.,Lily
01x08,What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there.,Lily
01x08,What the hell?,Lily
01x08,What?,Robin
01x08,This is my apartment.,Lily
01x08,Where?,Robin
01x08,Right here.,Lily
01x08,What the hell?,Lily
01x08,"Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.",Robin
01x08,"No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right...",Lily
01x08,That's my dresser! And this is my closet.,Lily
01x08,"Hi, how many?",Waitress
01x08,"Yes, you know me?",Lily
01x08,"Yeah, from your homecoming picture. You're much prettier in person.",Waitress
01x08,"Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. Where's my stuff? Waitress: It's all in the back. We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go?",Lily
01x08,This is my apartment!,Lily
01x08,Not anymore.,Waitress
01x08,No way. You're making this up.,Ted
01x08,"Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice.",Marshall
01x08,They sent you a notice about this.,Waitress
01x08,When?,Lily
01x08,Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines.,Waitress
01x08,"Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.",Marshall
01x08,"OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.",Lily
01x08,She may be 98 years old but she's still...,Lily
01x08,"She's dead, isn't she?",Lily
01x08,Never even saw the bus.,Waitress
01x08,My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?,Lily
01x08,Come live with us.,Ted
01x08,Really?,Lily
01x08,Of course.,Ted
01x08,"You sure about this, Ted?",Marshall
01x08,"Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",Ted
01x08,"No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",Barney
01x08,What? What are you talking about?,Ted
01x08,And why is that girl checking you out?,Robin
01x08,"Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",Barney
01x08,"Yeah, so?",Ted
01x08,"So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",Barney
01x08,"Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",Robin
01x08,"Yeah, we've talked about it.",Ted
01x08,"So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",Marshall
01x08,"Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",Ted
01x08,Who?,Marshall
01x08,Future Ted and Future Marshall.,Ted
01x08,Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.,Marshall
01x08,Dammit Past Ted,Ted
01x08,"You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",Barney
01x08,That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.,Ted
01x08,One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.,Ted
01x08,"Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",Barney
01x08,"Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",Robin
01x08,Sort of on a date with her.,Barney
01x08,What?,Ted
01x08,"I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",Barney
01x08,All right.,Ted
01x08,You're going to the hospital?,Robin
01x08,"No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",Ted
01x08,"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",Robin
01x08,"Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",Barney
01x08,"So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",Robin
01x08,"He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",Ted
01x08,"Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",Robin
01x08,I should really make this call.,Ted
01x08,"Ooh, can I do it?",Robin
01x08,"Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.",Barney
01x08,"Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",Barney
01x08,"Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",Robin
01x08,"An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.",Barney
01x08,Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?,Barney
01x08,"Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",Robin
01x08,"Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",Barney
01x08,See you guys later.,Barney
01x08,"Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",Ted
01x08,"Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",Ted
01x08,What happened to Shocky?,Ted
01x08,"What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?",Ted
01x08,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",Ted
01x08,Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,Marshall
01x08,"Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",Ted
01x08,"Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",Marshall
01x08,"No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",Ted
01x08,You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,Marshall
01x08,That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,Ted
01x08,They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,Ted
01x08,"Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",Barney
01x08,"Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",Robin
01x08,It's not just the coffeemaker.,Ted
01x08,Done. The painting's done.,Lily
01x08,That is great.,Marshall
01x08,Nice.,Ted
01x08,Where do you wanna hang it?,Marshall
01x08,"I don't know. Um, over the piano?",Lily
01x08,"Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",Ted
01x08,"Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",Marshall
01x08,"I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",Ted
01x08,OK.,Lily
01x08,He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,Ted
01x08,"Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",Robin
01x08,"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",Robin
01x08,"Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",Barney
01x08,"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",Ted
01x08,"You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",Barney
01x08,"What, like buy a new sofa?",Ted
01x08,Bigger.,Barney
01x08,"Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",Barney
01x08,"A lemon law, like for cars.",Robin
01x08,"Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",Barney
01x08,Hi Katie. Barney.,Barney
01x08,"Hi, it's good to finally meet you.",Katie
01x08,"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",Barney
01x08,Tell your friends.,Barney
01x08,It's gonna be a thing.,Barney
01x08,"Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved Ted into that block of cheese.",Lily
01x08,"Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",Marshall
01x08,He's not cool with me moving in.,Lily
01x08,"No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",Marshall
01x08,"So, what's he PMS'ing about?",Lily
01x08,I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.,Marshall
01x08,Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.,Lily
01x08,He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.,Lily
01x08,You clearly don't know Ted.,Marshall
01x08,Delivery for Ted Mosby.,Delivery guy
01x08,Your English phone booth arrived.,Marshall
01x08,"Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",Ted
01x08,"Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",Marshall
01x08,"Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",Ted
01x08,"Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",Marshall
01x08,Exactly.,Ted
01x08,Great,Marshall
01x08,Terrific.,Marshall
01x08,You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.,Marshall
01x08,"Oh, so it's like that, is it?",Ted
01x08,"Bring, bring.",Marshall
01x08,"Oh hello governor, oh it's like isn't it? Cheerio.",Marshall 
01x08,"Yeah, it's like that.",Marshall
01x08,I want this apartment.,Ted
01x08,"Well, I want it too.",Marshall
01x08,You're a jerk.,Girl  2
01x08,"No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",Barney
01x08,"For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",Robin
01x08,"No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",Barney
01x08,"It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",Robin
01x08,"OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",Barney
01x08,You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?,Barney
01x08,"Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",Robin
01x08,"Bad move, Scherbatsky.",Barney
01x08,"Hi, have you met Robin?",Barney
01x08,Hi.,Kevin
01x08,Hi.,Robin
01x08,"All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.",Ted
01x08,Or we could flip a coin.,Marshall
01x08,"Yeah, let's flip a coin.",Ted
01x08,Flip it.,Marshall
01x08,"OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.",Ted
01x08,Flip it.,Marshall
01x08,"OK, here I go.",Ted
01x08,Flip it.,Marshall
01x08,"I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",Ted
01x08,That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?,Marshall
01x08,"OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",Ted
01x08,You don't need two rooms,Marshall
01x08,"Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",Ted
01x08,We might be starting a family soon.,Marshall
01x08,"Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.",Ted
01x08,"It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",Marshall
01x08,"Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",Ted
01x08,"Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.",Marshall
01x08,"Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",Ted
01x08,We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?,Ted
01x08,"My fianc...suddenly, she's my fianc.",Marshall
01x08,"I deserve this apartment, Marshall.",Ted
01x08,No more than I do.,Marshall
01x08,"Great, so let's flip for it.",Ted
01x08,Flip it.,Marshall
01x08,"So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?",Ted
01x08,I guess so.,Marshall
01x08,How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?,Ted
01x08,We should probably figure that out.,Marshall
01x08,"It's OK, it's OK.",Ted
01x08,Can I observe something?,Ted
01x08,That this is kinda awesome?,Marshall
01x08,Totally.,Ted
01x08,I can't believe we didn't do this before.,Marshall
01x08,I know!,Ted
01x08,Thank you.,Robin
01x08,I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.,Kevin
01x08,It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.,Robin
01x08,In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders.,Kevin
01x08,Just a second.,Robin
01x08,Hello.,Robin
01x08,"Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.",Barney
01x08,Leave me alone.,Robin
01x08,"4:56, 4:57, 4:58.",Barney
01x08,We're only just getting to know each other.,Robin
01x08,Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.,Barney
01x08,Sorry.,Robin
01x08,"Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.",Kevin
01x08,"No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.",Robin
01x08,"Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money.",Kevin
01x08,That was awesome.,Marshall
01x08,I know.,Ted
01x08,Do it again.,Marshall
01x08,"OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",Ted
01x08,"Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",Ted
01x08,"Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",Marshall
01x08,What?,Ted
01x08,"Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",Marshall
01x08,Anhedonic?,Ted
01x08,Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,Marshall
01x08,The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.,Ted
01x08,"I know, this rules.",Marshall
01x08,"Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",Marshall
01x08,"That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",Ted
01x08,Yeah it did.,Marshall
01x08,You remember when we first got these swords?,Marshall
01x08,It was the day we moved in.,Ted
01x08,"Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.",Ted
01x08,"List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table",Marshall
01x08,"Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.",Ted
01x08,Yeah.,Marshall
01x08,"Oh God, I'll be right there.",Robin
01x08,"Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.",Robin
01x08,"Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront.",Kevin
01x08,"No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.",Robin
01x08,I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fianc.,Marshall
01x08,"Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fianc? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.",Ted
01x08,"I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",Ted
01x08,Is she OK?,Robin
01x08,They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.,Marshall
01x08,"So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
01x08,"What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
01x08,"Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.",Barney
01x08,"Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.",Jackie
01x08,"It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.",Barney
01x08,But you're totally...,Robin
01x08,Just let him have this one.,Ted
01x08,All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table?,Doctor
01x08,That's us.,Marshall
01x08,A sword fight?,Lily
01x08,"Sorry, Lily.","Marshall, Ted"
01x08,"On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fianc ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.",Lily
01x08,"Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",Marshall
01x08,"I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",Lily
01x08,You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.,Marshall
01x08,"Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.",Ted
01x08,"Uh, you know, if I tried...",Marshall
01x08,"Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",Lily
01x08,Gonna miss the old place.,Marshall
01x08,I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.,Lily
01x08,"Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.",Ted
01x08,Totally.,Marshall
01x08,Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving.,Lily
01x08,Let's go get some dinner.,Marshall
01x08,I know just the place.,Lily
01x08,"Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.",Ted
01x08,"I told you. OK, a toast.",Lily
01x08,"Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.",Lily
01x08,Here here. Cheers,Everyone
01x08,And to the lemon law.,Barney
01x08,Self-clink.,Barney
01x08,"And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses.",Lily
01x08,I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.,Marshall
01x08,I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year.,Lily
01x08,"Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.",Robin
01x08,"I love you, Lily. Happy Valentine's Day 1998.",Marshall 
01x09,"Kids, this is a Thanksgiving story.",Future Ted
01x09,"Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time. It's a time for giving of yourself, for thinking of your fellow man, a time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder.",Future Ted VO
01x09,"Well, I just ralphed.",Lily
01x09,How much did you guys drink last night?,Robin
01x09,Not how much? What.,Ted
01x09,"The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.",Barney
01x09,It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.,Marshall
01x09,"You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan.",Ted
01x09,The shuttle's here!,Marshall
01x09,He hasn't been back home to Minnesota since Christmas. He's a little excited.,Lily
01x09,"Baby, we're holding up the shuttle, do you have everything you need? Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants. Underpants.",Marshall
01x09,"So, Lil, Marshall's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited?",Ted
01x09,"Yeah, no, it'll be fun.",Lily
01x09,"Lily, you just said, yeah, no.",Robin
01x09,"Did I? No, I, I love Marshall's family.",Lily
01x09,Oh.,"Robin, Ted"
01x09,"But, yeah, no, it'll be great.",Lily
01x09,You just did it again.,Ted
01x09,"Yeah, no, shut up.",Lily
01x09,"Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving.",Robin
01x09,"No, I have to work on Friday. You?",Ted
01x09,"I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.",Robin
01x09,"Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, oat",Ted
01x09,"You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.",Robin
01x09,Your cops are called Mounties.,Ted
01x09,"So, probably hanging out with Barney then?",Robin
01x09,"No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.",Ted
01x09,"Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal.",Barney
01x09,"Oh, Barney.",Lily
01x09,"I'm sorry, Native American.",Barney
01x09,"I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food.",Ted
01x09,That's awesome.,Robin
01x09,"Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.",Ted
01x09,Canceling out Barney.,Barney
01x09,Exactly.,Ted
01x09,Where are all my underpants?,Marshall
01x09,Did you check your suitcase?,Lily
01x09,Let's go.,Marshall
01x09,"And go they went, all the way to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Marshall's hometown. And as Lily stepped into her fiance's boyhood home, she received a big welcome.",Future Ted VO
01x09,"Hello, we're home!",Marshall
01x09,"A very big welcome. You see, at 6'4, Marshall was the runt of the Ericksen clan.",Future Ted VO
01x09,"Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.",Lily
01x09,Where's my almost daughter-in-law?,Mr. Ericksen
01x09,Here I am.,Lily
01x09,"You got yourself a great little bride here, son.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,"All right now, no farting around. Put your skates and your pads on, boys. Game on in five minutes.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,You're gonna go play hockey?,Lily
01x09,With a basketball?,Lily
01x09,"Well, it's a combination of the two. We call it baskiceball.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world.,Marshall
01x09,Baskiceball? Not iceketball?,Lily
01x09,Iceketball? Just sounds weird.,Mr. Ericksen
01x09,Yeah.,Ericksens
01x09,"It's baskiceball, OK? And I'm the best.",Marcus
01x09,You wish.,Marshall
01x09,"Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play.",Lily
01x09,"I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl.",Marshall
01x09,"Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl.",Lily
01x09,Marcus!,Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,This is gonna be great.,Robin
01x09,"I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.",Ted
01x09,"Excuse me, guys. Coming through.",Barney
01x09,Barney?,Ted
01x09,"Well, hi guys.",Barney
01x09,What are you doing here?,Ted
01x09,"Oh, just the Lord's work.",Barney
01x09,But you're Satan.,Ted
01x09,"Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.",Barney
01x09,"This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here.",Robin
01x09,"Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?",Kendall
01x09,I'm on it.,Barney
01x09,"Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?",Ted
01x09,"Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer",Kendall
01x09,"That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.",Barney
01x09,"Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?",Ted
01x09,"Go home, we're full.",Kendall
01x09,"What? Ted: We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help?",Robin
01x09,"On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can.",Kendall
01x09,"Come on, we just wanna help out.",Robin
01x09,"Kendall, they're cool.",Barney
01x09,"Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.",Kendall
01x09,"OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.",Barney
01x09,"Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's early but you are a future Mrs. Ericksen.",Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it.,Lily
01x09,"OK, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty.",Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,"Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette.",Lily
01x09,But this is an American holiday.,Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,"Now that you're going to be a Mrs. Ericksen, I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe. The Ericksen family seven-layer salad.",Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,Seven-layer salad?,Lily
01x09,Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right.,Lily
01x09,"Oh no, dear, sixteen cups.",Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,Mayo's in that cabinet.,Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,"Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it.",Marshall
01x09,"Yeah, you were sitting pretty until I whacked you with that mallet.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,Hey Gorgeous!,Mr. Ericksen
01x09,"You having fun? Lily: Yeah, but I kinda miss you. Could you stay in here for a little bit?",Marshall
01x09,"Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime.",Marshall
01x09,"Oh, halftime's over. Get yours butts out here, come on.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,"And I hope you like the taste of stick, dorko.",Marvin
01x09,Go.,Lily
01x09,Thanks baby.,Marshall
01x09,"Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town?",Marshall
01x09,"Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!",Marshall
01x09,"Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.",Barney
01x09,Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot.,Robin
01x09,"Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?",Ted
01x09,"You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.",Barney
01x09,"OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next?",Lily
01x09,Potato chips.,Lily
01x09,"So, Lily, when are you gonna start thinking about having a baby?",Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,"Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all.",Lily
01x09,"Actually Aunt Lily was lying. It'd been all she'd been thinking about. You see, remember when she said...",Future Ted VO
01x09,"Well, I just ralphed.",Lily
01x09,At that point she was five days late. This was day six.,Future Ted VO
01x09,"Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?",Lily
01x09,"Oh, are you kidding? I was younger than you when I had Marcus. Beautiful 15 pound boy. Not much bigger than this turkey right here.",Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,Oh my.,Lily
01x09,"Now if Lily was already uneasy about joining the Ericksen family, imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Ericksen growing inside of her.",Future Ted VO
01x09,"That's a big baby, Judy.",Lily
01x09,The doctor thought he was twins.,Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,Twins. Twins!,Lily
01x09,This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work?,Ted
01x09,I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend.,Robin
01x09,Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway?,Ted
01x09,I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at.,Robin
01x09,"What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl...",Ted
01x09,Have you met Ted?,Robin
01x09,"Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is...",Ted
01x09,... gone.,Ted
01x09,I'm Amanda.,Amanda
01x09,Hi.,Ted
01x09,"So, what do you do here, Ted?",Amanda
01x09,"Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing.",Ted
01x09,"If you want to do something, you and your girlfriend can help sort through these donations.",Amanda
01x09,"Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God.",Robin
01x09,"So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?",Ted
01x09,"OK, this is important. Go through all these boxes of food donations, take out the really good stuff and put it into this box.",Amanda
01x09,Got it. Consider it sorted.,Ted
01x09,"Hey, we're in business.",Robin
01x09,"Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.",Ted
01x09,Let's start with this one.,Ted
01x09,Yeah.,Robin
01x09,Amen.,Mr. Ericksen
01x09,Amen.,Ericksens
01x09,Look who came to say good-night. It's little Martin. Three-months old.,Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,Three months! Three months?,Lily
01x09,He's been drinking his milk.,Marshall
01x09,Here here.,Ericksens
01x09,And she's already pregnant again.,Lily
01x09,"Well, that's 'cause those Ericksen boy's boys can swim. They've got two tails and a drill bit for a head.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,"Dad, you're embarrassing me.",Marshall
01x09,"Ah, son, she's cool. She's gonna be an Ericksen.",Mr. Ericksen
01x09,"Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name.",Lily
01x09,But the apron.,Mrs. Ericksen
01x09,"Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so...",Marshall
01x09,"No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name.",Lily
01x09,But Ericksen is a great last name. People know the Ericksen's.,Mr. Ericksen
01x09,"Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby?",Lily
01x09,"Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.",Marshall
01x09,"Oh, so is New York.",Lily
01x09,What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.,Lily
01x09,"Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?",Ted
01x09,"Oh, that's for me. You can put it in my car.",Amanda
01x09,"In your car, um, then you'll take it...",Ted
01x09,"Home? We get so much extra food, no one can eat it all. Oh, Truffle oil. Score.",Amanda
01x09,People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry.,Ted
01x09,"I know, and I'm starving.",Amanda
01x09,"But, Marshall, you love New York.",Lily
01x09,"Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.",Marshall
01x09,"Yeah, to Brooklyn.",Lily
01x09,Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road.,Marshall
01x09,But Lily knew way down the road might not be so far down the road.,Future Ted VO
01x09,I need to go to the restroom.,Lily
01x09,"Lily, the restroom's the other way.",Marshall
01x09,So she headed down the road.,Future Ted VO
01x09,Lily.,Marshall
01x09,Lily!,Marshall
01x09,"So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.",Barney
01x09,"Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?",Kendall
01x09,"Yeah, Right. Thanks.",Barney
01x09,Barney.,Ted
01x09,"Yeah, what's up?",Barney
01x09,You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.,Ted
01x09,"Yeah, so.",Barney
01x09,"All right, let me see that.",Ted
01x09,That's my private personal business!,Barney
01x09,Court-mandated community service.,Ted
01x09,That's my private personal business.,Barney
01x09,I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.,Barney
01x09,You peed on a church?,Ted
01x09,I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.,Barney
01x09,"Oh, you are evil.",Ted
01x09,"Now, all's right with the world again.",Robin
01x09,"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.",Barney
01x09,When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?,Barney
01x09,"Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people.",Ted
01x09,Amanda! I called dibs on the Portobello mushrooms.,Kendall
01x09,Those are for the hungry.,Ted
01x09,"I know, and I'm starving.",Kendall
01x09,Those are good mushrooms!,Amanda
01x09,Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!,Ted
01x09,Happy Thanksgiving.,Clerk
01x09,"Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me.",Lily
01x09,You know the Ericksen's? Marshall's fianc.,Clerk
01x09,Fantastic.,Lily
01x09,So nice to meet you. You are taller than described.,Clerk
01x09,I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom?,Lily
01x09,Don't have one.,Clerk
01x09,So what do you do when you have to...?,Lily
01x09,I hold it.,Clerk
01x09,You can't fire a volunteer.,Ted
01x09,Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,Robin
01x09,I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,Barney
01x09,Volunteer of the year!,Barney
01x09,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.",Ted
01x09,"Ted, I'm glad you asked.",Barney
01x09,Surprisingly good.,Robin
01x09,Right? I told you so.,Barney
01x09,Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?,Ted
01x09,Lily's been arrested.,Marshall
01x09,"Oh dear, what for? Marshall: Public urination.",Judy
01x09,"Thanks, Pete.",Marshall
01x09,No problemo Marsh.,Pete
01x09,You all right? Lily: No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.,Marshall
01x09,"Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?",Marshall
01x09,"OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise.",Lily
01x09,"Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just...",Marshall
01x09,Just promise.,Lily
01x09,Why do you want me to promise you that?,Marshall
01x09,Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.,Lily
01x09,"I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?",Marshall
01x09,"OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test.",Pete
01x09,Pete arrested me before I could look at it.,Lily
01x09,Whoa.,Marshall
01x09,Yeah.,Lily
01x09,"Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous.",Marshall
01x09,"Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall: There are no rules, we just wail on each other.",Lily
01x09,"Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.",Marshall
01x09,"Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.",Lily
01x09,"Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.",Lily
01x09,What does it say? Lily: I'm afraid to look.,Marshall
01x09,It's negative.,Pete
01x09,Thank God.,Lily
01x09,And hey!,Lily
01x09,Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.,Robin
01x09,"You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.",Ted
01x09,"OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.",Barney
01x09,Are you joking?,Ted
01x09,I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.,Barney
01x09,"No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.",Ted
01x09,"No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.",Walter
01x09,"Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.",Barney
01x09,You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes.,Robin
01x09,"You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.",Ted
01x09,"Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
01x09,"Thank you so much. No really, thank you.",Walter
01x09,"Happy Thanksgiving, guys.",Ted
01x09,Thanksgiving in November. Weird.,Robin
01x09,"So that was Thanksgiving 2005. To be honest, it didn't go great. But like has plenty of good parts. It's the rough parts that make you thankful that you have people to share it with.",Future Ted VO
01x09,"Hey, I saw what you did for that guy? It was really sweet. Do you wanna dance?",Dancer
01x09,"Uh, no thanks. You want some yams?",Ted
01x09,No thanks. I'm Amber.,Dancer
01x09,I'm Ted.,Ted
01x09,"Actually, I'm Tracy.",Dancer
01x09,Still Ted.,Ted
01x09,"And that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother.",Future Ted VO
01x09,What?!,"Daughter, Son"
01x09,I'm kidding.,Future Ted
01x10,"Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother, but there's one story I don't remember. Uncle Marshall still refers to it as the pineapple incident.",Future Ted VO
01x10,On the house.,Carl
01x10,Whoa.,Everyone
01x10,It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon.,Carl
01x10,"Wow. Thanks, Carl.",Everyone
01x10,"We're not really doing shots, are we?",Ted
01x10,I hope not.,Lily
01x10,"No, no.",Barney
01x10,These look kinda like blood.,Lily
01x10,"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",Marshall
01x10,That's ridiculous.,Barney
01x10,"I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.",Marshall
01x10,"Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.",Robin
01x10,"Well, I should go get dressed.",Robin
01x10,"Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?",Ted
01x10,"I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire.",Lily
01x10,"Lily, I told you not to call him that.",Robin
01x10,"Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?",Ted
01x10,He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?,Robin
01x10,"So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?",Ted
01x10,A charity dinner.,Robin
01x10,"Yeah, 2000 a plate.",Lily
01x10,"1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.",Robin
01x10,You gonna put out?,Barney
01x10,What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.,Barney
01x10,I think my soul just threw up a little bit.,Lily
01x10,"Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.",Robin
01x10,See ya.,Ted
01x10,Bye.,Lily
01x10,You OK?,Marshall
01x10,"Sure, why?",Ted
01x10,I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.,Marshall
01x10,"OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...",Ted
01x10,What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,Barney
01x10,"Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?",Ted
01x10,Daddy's home.,Barney
01x10,Daddy's home?,Ted
01x10,Yeah.,Barney
01x10,"You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.",Ted
01x10,"Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.",Barney
01x10,"OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?",Marshall
01x10,Garlic fries.,Lily
01x10,"OK, well, I'll get back to you.",Marshall
01x10,"Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...",Ted
01x10,"Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?",Barney
01x10,That worked. I hate the world.,Ted
01x10,"Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.",Barney
01x10,Doo-doo.,Marshall
01x10,Totally.,Barney
01x10,"So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.",Ted
01x10,Oh yes it can.,Barney
01x10,Interesting,Marshall
01x10,"Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",Barney
01x10,"So, what? You want me to do a shot.",Ted
01x10,Oh no. I want you to do five shots.,Barney
01x10,"Oooh, more interesting.",Marshall
01x10,"Barney, I think you've officially...",Ted
01x10,"No, don't think. Do.",Barney
01x10,"Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.",Marshall
01x10,"Drink, drink, drink, drink...",Barney
01x10,"Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?",Ted
01x10,"Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink",Lily
01x10,"Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...",Barney
01x10,"Yes! Drink, drink, drink...",Barney
01x10,"Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?",Ted
01x10,"Drink! Drink, drink...",Barney
01x10,Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.,Ted
01x10,"I love it, I love it, I love it.",Barney
01x10,"Drink, drink, drink...","Marshall, Lily"
01x10,"This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.",Ted
01x10,"Drink, drink, drink, drink...",Barney
01x10,This is a superbrain.,Ted
01x10,This brain is unstoppable. This brain...,Ted
01x10,"And that's all I remember, except for a few hazy memories.",Future Ted VO
01x10,"But really, the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning.",Future Ted VO
01x10,"So, there were some unanswered questions.",Future Ted VO
01x10,How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle?,Future Ted VO
01x10,And who was this girl in my bed?,Future Ted VO
01x10,"OK, what the hell happened last night?",Ted
01x10,"You really don't remember, Superbrain?",Marshall
01x10,"So, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily filled me in.",Future Ted VO
01x10,And how did you guys like the shots?,Carl
01x10,"I drank all five, bitch.",Ted
01x10,I love drunk Ted.,Marshall
01x10,Marshall thinks you're a vampire.,Ted
01x10,"If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.",Carl
01x10,No dibs.,Lily
01x10,Oh.,Marshall
01x10,No....Dammit.,Barney
01x10,How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.,Ted
01x10,Who are you calling?,Lily
01x10,Robin.,Ted
01x10,"Oh, bad idea.",Marshall
01x10,"No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.",Barney
01x10,Says every girl you've ever slept with.,Lily
01x10,Say what?!,Marshall
01x10,"Hello Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
01x10,Oh hi Ted.,Robin
01x10,"Hello Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
01x10,Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.,Robin
01x10,"Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?",Ted
01x10,"Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.",Robin
01x10,"I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.",Ted
01x10,That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.,Robin
01x10,"Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.",Ted
01x10,Bye Ted.,Robin
01x10,Slow.,Ted
01x10,"Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots.",Marshall
01x10,Friends don't let friends drink and dial.,Lily
01x10,I need that phone back.,Ted
01x10,You'll get this back at the end of class.,Lily
01x10,"Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.",Barney
01x10,Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.,Ted
01x10,"Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney: Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out.",Lily
01x10,Cheap Trick? Oh Ted.,Marshall
01x10,"Hello again, Ted.",Robin
01x10,"Hey, it's me again.",Ted
01x10,Plain to see again.,Ted
01x10,Please can I see you every day?,Ted
01x10,I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
01x10,"And we love you, drunk Ted.",Marshall
01x10,I'm a fool again.,Ted
01x10,I fell in love...,Ted
01x10,Ted?,Robin
01x10,"Well, that explains the ankle.",Ted
01x10,And then we brought you home and put you to bed.,Lily
01x10,Was there anyone else in there with me?,Ted
01x10,There's a girl in there.,Lily
01x10,I know.,Ted
01x10,And a pineapple.,Marshall
01x10,I know.,Ted
01x10,Who is she?,Lily
01x10,I don't know.,Ted
01x10,What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa.,Ted
01x10,"That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.",Lily
01x10,Hello.,Barney
01x10,Why are you sleeping in our tub?,Ted
01x10,The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.,Barney
01x10,"Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?",Lily
01x10,"Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tnk.",Barney
01x10,How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.,Marshall
01x10,"Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.",Barney
01x10,You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.,Ted
01x10,"Good night, Ted.",Lily
01x10,"Love you too, buddy.",Marshall
01x10,I'm back baby doll!,Ted
01x10,"Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.",Barney
01x10,"All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?",Barney
01x10,I think....,Ted
01x10,"Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.",Barney
01x10,Bring it.,Ted
01x10,Have you met Ted?,Barney
01x10,You're calling Robin.,Barney
01x10,I'm calling Robin.,Ted
01x10,"Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.",Barney
01x10,Oh yeah? What you gonna do?,Ted
01x10,"If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.",Barney
01x10,You're bluffing.,Ted
01x10,"Hello, Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
01x10,"Ted, for the last time, stop.",Robin
01x10,Ted!,Robin
01x10,You set me on fire.,Ted
01x10,"Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.",Barney
01x10,You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?,Ted
01x10,And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?,Marshall
01x10,Who is she?,Barney
01x10,I have no idea.,Ted
01x10,Nice.,Barney
01x10,You really don't know who that is?,Ted
01x10,"No, after I hosed you down with a beverage gn, I brought you back here.",Barney
01x10,I better not have gotten burned.,Ted
01x10,Did any of you write that?,Ted
01x10,"Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that?",Lily
01x10,I don't know.,Ted
01x10,"Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.",Marshall
01x10,"OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it.",Marshall
01x10,Hello.,Guy
01x10,"Uh, hi, who is this?",Ted
01x10,"You called me, who's this?",Guy
01x10,It's Ted.,Ted
01x10,"It's Carl, from the bar.",Carl
01x10,And then Carl filled us in.,Future Ted VO
01x10,"Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.",Ted
01x10,"Sleep it off, bra.",Barney
01x10,"I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up.",Ted
01x10,"I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on.",Ted
01x10,"Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl: I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.",Ted
01x10,"Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?",Ted
01x10,"Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now.",Ted
01x10,Give me your arm.,Carl
01x10,"This way, if you pass out in the gutter...",Carl
01x10,That tickles.,Ted
01x10,Someone will call me and I will come get you.,Carl
01x10,"Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it.",Ted
01x10,Excuse me?,Carl
01x10,"Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call.",Ted
01x10,"Yeah, this'll go good.",Carl
01x10,"Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great.",Ted
01x10,Thanks Carl.,Ted
01x10,It's Robin. That's Robin in there.,Ted
01x10,Did you guys?,Marshall
01x10,"Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.",Barney
01x10,"All right, right over here.",Lily
01x10,"Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...",Ted
01x10,"Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again.",Barney
01x10,"Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad.",Marshall
01x10,You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.,Lily
01x10,Wake her up and say what?,Ted
01x10,Daddy's home.,Barney
01x10,Good luck buddy.,Marshall
01x10,Hello.,Ted
01x10,"Ted, it's Robin.",Robin
01x10,Are you sure?,Ted
01x10,"Hey, Robin, how are you?",Ted
01x10,"Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?",Robin
01x10,Ask her about the pineapple.,Marshall
01x10,"Yeah, sure, come on over.",Ted
01x10,Thanks.,Robin
01x10,"No, wait, don't, no.",Ted
01x10,She's coming over. Crap.,Ted
01x10,"Wait, this is klling me. We have to find out who that girl is.",Lily
01x10,Trudy. My name is Trudy.,Trudy
01x10,And then Trudy filled us in.,Future Ted VO
01x10,I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.,Trudy's friend
01x10,"I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.",Trudy
01x10,Daddy's home.,Barney
01x10,Or the one after that.,Trudy
01x10,"OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.",Barney
01x10,Ladies.,Barney
01x10,I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
01x10,Look at that idiot go.,Trudy's friend
01x10,He's kinda cute.,Trudy
01x10,"What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.",Ted
01x10,Did you?,Trudy
01x10,I did not.,Ted
01x10,And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.,Ted
01x10,"Sorry, Trudy, go on.",Ted
01x10,I liked your performance.,Trudy
01x10,What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.,Ted
01x10,"I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.",Trudy
01x10,Do it.,Ted
01x10,"I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid.",Trudy
01x10,"I'm something stupid, do me.",Ted
01x10,You're funny.,Trudy
01x10,"Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK.",Ted
01x10,Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.,Ted
01x10,That's hauntingly beautiful.,Ted
01x10,"Hey, it works.",Ted
01x10,Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.,Trudy
01x10,I need to make one more call.,Ted
01x10,Hello.,Trudy
01x10,"Hey, it's me again.",Ted
01x10,Hey.,Trudy
01x10,"Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.",Ted
01x10,"So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.",Trudy
01x10,"Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.",Marshall
01x10,"Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.",Ted
01x10,"Why, is that your girlfriend?",Trudy
01x10,"No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.",Ted
01x10,"You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this.",Trudy
01x10,"No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.",Ted
01x10,Hi.,Ted
01x10,Hey guys.,Robin
01x10,Robin.,Barney
01x10,Hi Robin.,Lily
01x10,Top of the morning.,Barney
01x10,"Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.",Ted
01x10,"No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.",Robin
01x10,Let's go get a snack.,Lily
01x10,I love to snack.,Marshall
01x10,I'm good.,Barney
01x10,"Come on, those calls weren't that weird.",Ted
01x10,"Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.",Ted
01x10,That goes on for three-and a half minutes.,Robin
01x10,Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.,Ted
01x10,"Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.",Robin
01x10,"No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.",Ted
01x10,"Really, you moved on?",Robin
01x10,"Yes. What, you don't believe me?",Ted
01x10,"Oh, OK.",Ted
01x10,"Trudy, come on out.",Ted
01x10,"Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool.",Robin
01x10,"Trudy, come on out.",Ted
01x10,"Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.",Ted
01x10,Trudy?,Ted
01x10,"Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.",Robin
01x10,I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.,Ted
01x10,"Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.",Ted
01x10,"Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?",Robin
01x10,"Yes, you did, last night.",Robin
01x10,Really? Well.,Ted
01x10,"Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.",Robin
01x10,"I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.",Future Ted VO
01x10,"Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious.",Future Ted VO
01x11,"Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks. Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve. I had an idea of how to do it, too. And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.",Ted from 2030
01x11,"Yeah, that's right...a limo.",Ted
01x11,"Oh, man, Ted, this is great.",Robin
01x11,"Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.",Ted
01x11,Question?,Barney
01x11,"Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.",Ted
01x11,"But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.",Barney
01x11,Yeah.,Lily
01x11,"We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.",Ted
01x11,"All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?",Lily
01x11,Mary Beth?,Robin
01x11,"Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...",Ted
01x11,"People often ask me Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?",Barney
01x11,By who? Who asks you that?,Lily
01x11,"And the answer is right here... my own, personal get psyched mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",Barney
01x11,It's working.,Lily
01x11,I am definitely getting psyched.,Ted
01x11,"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.",Marshall
01x11,Let's do this!,Barney
01x11,"Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?",Ted
01x11,"Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome.",Barney
01x11,I've moved up in the world.,Ranjit
01x11,How do you guys know each other?,Robin
01x11,"Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.",Ted
01x11,"Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.",Barney
01x11,"Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.",Robin
01x11,"Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek. Derek. He was like rich, successful, handsome. I hated that guy.",Ted from 2030
01x11,"Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.",Robin
01x11,Bye.,Lily
01x11,See ya next year. Go get 'em.,Ted
01x11,"Well, this kind of sucks.",Lily
01x11,"Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.",Ted
01x11,Party number one!,Ranjit
01x11,Party number one!,Barney
01x11,"I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.",Marshall
01x11,"Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.",Ted
01x11,"We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.",Lily
01x11,Hi. Mary Beth. So great to meet you guys.,Mary Beth
01x11,My word.,Marshall
01x11,"You're, you're friendly.",Lily
01x11,American party friends of Barney's.,Mary Beth
01x11,"Oh, no.",Lily
01x11,"So, Barney, who's your new friend?",Ted
01x11,Natalya.,Barney
01x11,"Oh, friendly.",Natalya
01x11,"So, where are you from, Natalya?",Lily
01x11,She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?,Barney
01x11,"Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?",Natalya
01x11,Isn't she awesome?,Barney
01x11,"How are your feet doing, baby?",Marshall
01x11,"Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?",Lily
01x11,"Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.",Ted
01x11,"Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.",Lily
01x11,"It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?",Barney
01x11,Ranjit! Party number two.,Ted
01x11,Party number two.,Ranjit
01x11,Party number two? Not so good.,Ted
01x11,Let's go back to party number one.,Marshall
01x11,"No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three.",Ted
01x11,Party number three. Yeah.,Ranjit
01x11,"Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya.",Barney
01x11,"Barney, none of us really liked her.",Lily
01x11,What?!,Barney
01x11,Sorry.,Lily
01x11,"Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?",Barney
01x11,I'm sorry about Barney.,Ted
01x11,"No, I'm having a great time. I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.",Mary Beth
01x11,"Me, too.  Hey, Robin.",Ted
01x11,"Ted, Derek stood me up.",Robin
01x11,"Pfft. Derek. Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl. But... it was Robin.",Ted from 2030
01x11,"Ranjit, turn it around.",Ted
01x11,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.",Robin
01x11,"No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together.",Ted
01x11,What happened?,Lily
01x11,Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.,Robin
01x11,"Oh, dude, not now!",Marshall
01x11,What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.,Barney
01x11,Maybe I should just go home.,Robin
01x11,My finger slipped.,Barney
01x11,"Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight.",Ted
01x11,"Hi, I'm Robin.",Robin
01x11,Mary Beth.,Mary Beth
01x11,You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?,Robin
01x11,"That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!",Ted
01x11,"Oh, yes. Ted, you rock.",Robin
01x11,"We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?",Barney
01x11,"Yeah, we like hot dogs.",Marshall
01x11,"No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.",Barney
01x11,You don't know what you're missing.,Ranjit
01x11,"Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.",Ted
01x11,"Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car.",Lily
01x11,Stopping the car.,Ranjit
01x11,"Wait. Baby, what are you doing?",Marshall
01x11,I'm going home.,Lily
01x11,What? No!,Ted
01x11,"I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.",Lily
01x11,But... hot dogs.,Marshall
01x11,"Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.",Lily
01x11,"Okay, I'll go with you.",Marshall
01x11,"No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three.",Lily
01x11,Are you sure?,Marshall
01x11,"If I don't see you, happy new year.",Lily
01x11,Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other.,Marshall
01x11,I know we will.,Lily
01x11,Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs!,Marshall
01x11,"Ranjit, party number three.",Ted
01x11,Party number three.,Ranjit
01x11,"Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president.",Marshall
01x11,Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.,Ted
01x11,"Oh, so much better.",Robin
01x11,Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby.,Marshall
01x11,"Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.",Ted from 2030
01x11,No way.,Ted
01x11,That's totally Moby. That's awesome.,Robin
01x11,"Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!",Ted
01x11,"Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.",Barney
01x11,Hey.,Ted
01x11,Hello.,Moby
01x11,"What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?",Ted
01x11,"Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.",Moby
01x11,You want a ride?,Ted
01x11,Sure.,Moby
01x11,Welcome.,Ted
01x11,Wow. You're friendly.,Moby
01x11,"Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?",Barney
01x11,"It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends.",Moby
01x11,"Wow, that sounds awesome.",Robin
01x11,You guys want to come?,Moby
01x11,"Yeah, we'd love to.",Ted
01x11,All right.,Moby
01x11,"Uh, Ted. Sidebar?",Marshall
01x11,"Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up?",Ted
01x11,What about Lily?,Marshall
01x11,Call her.,Ted
01x11,I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed.,Marshall
01x11,"That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...",Ted
01x11,"No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.",Marshall
01x11,But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party.,Ted
01x11,Moby's party.,Ranjit
01x11,"This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise.",Moby
01x11,"Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it.",Barney
01x11,"Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.",Moby
01x11,Jan... Aah!,Barney
01x11,"So then I say, your motorcycle was like that when I got here.",Moby
01x11,"You're not Moby, are you?",Ted
01x11,Who?,Moby
01x11,"Moby... the recording artist, Moby.",Robin
01x11,No.,Moby
01x11,"But when we said, Hey, Moby, you said, Yeah.",Barney
01x11,I thought you said Tony.,Not-Moby
01x11,So your name is Tony?,Ted
01x11,"No. Oh, hey, we're here. All right. You guys going to come in?",Not-Moby
01x11,Nah.,Ted
01x11,You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.,Not-Moby
01x11,"No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby.",Barney
01x11,"Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.",Not-Moby
01x11,Why did we think that guy was Moby?,Barney
01x11,"I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.",Ted
01x11,That's Marshall's phone. Hello.,Barney
01x11,"Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.",Lily
01x11,"Hey, sexy.",Barney
01x11,"Barney, where's Marshall?",Lily
01x11,He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.,Barney
01x11,What? Where?,Lily
01x11,Party number three.,Barney
01x11,"Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!",Lily
01x11,Moby?! She's upstairs.,Barney
01x11,"Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.",Ted
01x11,"Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a gn?",Lily
01x11,"Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?",Ted
01x11,Who was that guy?!,Lily
01x11,"Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.",Barney
01x11,"Ranjit, drive!",Ted
01x11,Where to?,Ranjit
01x11,Party number three!,Ted
01x11,Party number three!,Ranjit
01x11,"No, but I was just at party number three.",Lily
01x11,"No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.",Ted
01x11,"Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my Get Psyched mix!",Barney
01x11,"Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule.",Ted
01x11,"Ah, nuts.",Ranjit
01x11,"Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?",Ted
01x11,"No. I am pissed. Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.",Ranjit
01x11,"Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.",Ted
01x11,I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.,Lily
01x11,"Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.",Barney
01x11,Is this just 'cause you lost your Get Psyched mix?,Robin
01x11,I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?,Barney
01x11,"No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.  Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling",Robin
01x11,You give love a bad name,Ted and Robin
01x11,A bad name,Ranjit
01x11,I play my part and you played your game,Ted and Robin
01x11,I'm going to get some air.,Mary Beth
01x11,"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!",Ted and Robin
01x11,It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff.,Ted
01x11,"Ted, I'm going to head out. My roommates are having a party not far from here.",Mary Beth
01x11,"No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...",Ted
01x11,How long have you been in love with Robin?,Mary Beth
01x11,I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from?,Ted
01x11,"Ted, it's okay. I'm fine. And I can tell that she's into you, too.",Mary Beth
01x11,That's ridiculous. Wait. Really?,Ted
01x11,"Happy New Year, Ted.",Mary Beth
01x11,I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.,Lily
01x11,"Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.",Ted
01x11,"The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am.",Barney
01x11,"Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall.",Lily
01x11,But he left his phone.,Ted
01x11,Marshall! Marshall!,Lily
01x11,I'm sorry about your girl.,Robin
01x11,Sorry about your guy.,Ted
01x11,"Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not.",Robin
01x11,"I did not, too.",Ted
01x11,Derek. Hi. How's work?,Robin
01x11,I'll give you some privacy.,Ted
01x11,Marshall!,Lily
01x11,"Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.",Ted
01x11,Marshall!,Lily
01x11,"Give it a rest, Ted.",Barney
01x11,Give what a rest?,Ted
01x11,"Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.",Barney
01x11,Marshall!,Lily
01x11,"Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.",Ted
01x11,"Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist.",Barney
01x11,Marshall!,Lily
01x11,Lily!,Marshall
01x11,Holy crap.,Ted
01x11,Marshall!,Lily
01x11,I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually. So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked... I walked to the next party on the list.,Marshall
01x11,Not Moby's party?,Ted
01x11,"Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on.",Marshall
01x11,Come on! Oh! Oh!,Barney
01x11,"Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?",Lily
01x11,"I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there.",Marshall
01x11,How? We'll never get a cab.,Ted
01x11,The flat's fixed.,Ranjit
01x11,"Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!",Ted
01x11,Natalya?,Lily
01x11,"Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?",Barney
01x11,I didn't want to awake her. She looked so peaceful.,Ranjit
01x11,"Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?",Ted
01x11,I get you there in six.,Ranjit
01x11,I don't think I can do it.,Ranjit
01x11,No! Come on!,All
01x11,"Move, you stupid taxi!",Lily
01x11,Three minutes!,Marshall
01x11,Come on!,All
01x11,"Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.",Ted
01x11,Cheers. Well said.,Barney
01x11,Cheers.,All
01x11,"And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve. The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo.",Ted from 2030
01x11,Derek?! Derek.,Robin
01x11,Hey.,Derek
01x11,"Hey, uh, come on in.",Ted
01x11,I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.,Derek
01x11,I can't believe you made it.,Robin
01x11,"I made it, baby.",Derek
01x11,"I super love you, okay?",Natalia
01x11,"Here, you need a mint.",Barney
01x11,"Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!",All
01x11,"You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story. Well, don't. Not every night has a happy ending. But all of it's important. All of it was leading somewhere. Because suddenly, it was 2006. And 2006 was a big one.",Ted from 2030
01x11,"What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal.",Robin
01x11,What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him.,Ted
01x11,"Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting.",Robin
01x11,"Well, a deal is a deal.",Ted
01x11,Happy New Year.,Robin
01x11,Happy New Year.,Ted
01x12,"When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.",Future Ted VO
01x12,Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?,Ted
01x12,"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.",Barney
01x12,"You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.",Barney
01x12,"Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?",Ted
01x12,"Ted, it's a simile.",Barney
01x12,"Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a 200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?",Ted
01x12,Of course I knew who I wanted to bring: Robin.,Future Ted VO
01x12,"The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.",Future Ted VO
01x12,"Pft, Derek.",Future Ted VO
01x12,"Well, Derek and I just broke up.",Robin
01x12,"No, that's terrible, are you OK?",Lily
01x12,"Yeah, do you need a drink or something?",Marshall
01x12,"Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",Robin
01x12,"Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",Barney
01x12,"Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",Robin
01x12,"OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.",Ted
01x12,"Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave.",Lily
01x12,"Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.",Marshall
01x12,"No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.",Ted
01x12,Robin was into me when we first met. Fact.,Ted
01x12,"Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.",Ted
01x12,"On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.",Ted
01x12,I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,Ted
01x12,"What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.",Barney
01x12,"This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.",Marshall
01x12,"Ah, here we go.",Lily
01x12,What?,Barney
01x12,We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.,Lily
01x12,"Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.",Marshall
01x12,I thought so.,Lily
01x12,"You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.",Marshall
01x12,A little girl?,Lily
01x12,What up?,Barney
01x12,"Yes, but I'm the bride so I win.",Lily
01x12,"Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.",Marshall
01x12,"Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.",Lily
01x12,"Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.",Barney
01x12,"You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.",Ted
01x12,"Well, makes sense.",Robin
01x12,"So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?",Ted
01x12,"Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted: Fine. You wanna be my date?",Robin
01x12,"Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?",Robin
01x12,"Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.",Ted
01x12,"Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.",Robin
01x12,"Lily, I need a dress.",Robin
01x12,"You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?",Lily
01x12,"I know, it's a su1c1de mission.",Robin
01x12,"Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.",Lily
01x12,Bye babe.,Marshall
01x12,"Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.",Ted
01x12,"Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?",Ted
01x12,"Invigorating, thanks.",Barney
01x12,"OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked.",Future Ted VO
01x12,You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting. The stars line up and shazam.,Future Ted VO
01x12,I know now that life is never that simple.,Future Ted VO
01x12,"Hey, Claudia!",Ted
01x12,"Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye.",Claudia
01x12,"Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.",Ted
01x12,"Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.",Ted
01x12,"You should be, lots of single girls.",Claudia
01x12,"Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.",Ted
01x12,What? Ted: I'm bringing a date.,Claudia
01x12,You're not bringing a date.,Claudia
01x12,"Uh, yes I am.",Ted
01x12,"Uh, no you're not.",Claudia
01x12,I checked 'plus one'.,Ted
01x12,No you didn't.,Claudia
01x12,"Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...",Ted
01x12,"Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding.",Claudia
01x12,But I already invited someone.,Ted
01x12,"You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months!",Claudia
01x12,But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.,Ted
01x12,"You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it?",Claudia
01x12,"She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.",Ted
01x12,"What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes?",Claudia
01x12,"Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?",Ted
01x12,Don't make me hurt you Ted.,Claudia
01x12,"I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.",Ted
01x12,"But to be fair, she's also hot.",Barney
01x12,"I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.",Ted
01x12,"Yeah, right.",Barney
01x12,I did.,Ted
01x12,"Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?",Barney
01x12,"Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.",Ted
01x12,"Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...",Barney
01x12,A little Barney.,"Ted, Marshall"
01x12,"A little Barney. And you know what he said?  Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.",Barney
01x12,Wow.,Marshall
01x12,Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...,Ted
01x12,"Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.",Marshall
01x12,Then what am I gonna do?,Ted
01x12,The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come.,Marshall
01x12,Just a second.,Robin
01x12,Hey.,Lily
01x12,"Hey, listen.",Ted
01x12,"Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.",Lily
01x12,Lily's there's a problem.,Ted
01x12,"Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress.",Lily
01x12,Go.,Lily
01x12,"Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?",Robin
01x12,I think I brought it.,Robin
01x12,Wow.,Ted
01x12,That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.,Robin
01x12,"Yeah, about that.",Ted
01x12,"So, the dress?",Lily
01x12,I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.,Ted
01x12,What?,Lily
01x12,I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,Ted
01x12,Why didn't you check 'plus...,Lily
01x12,I did check 'plus one'.,Ted
01x12,But Robin is so excited.,Lily
01x12,I know.,Ted
01x12,And the dress.,Lily
01x12,I know.,Ted
01x12,"Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.",Lily
01x12,"We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.",Ted
01x12,I wish we were ninjas.,Lily
01x12,I know.,Ted
01x12,You can always ask Stuart.,Lily
01x12,Can I do that?,Ted
01x12,"Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40 his wedding too.",Lily
01x12,"Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.",Ted
01x12,"Dude, no problem whatsoever.",Stuart
01x12,"Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.",Ted
01x12,"Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...",Ted
01x12,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.",Stuart
01x12,"Yeah, she's not usually like that.",Ted
01x12,No.,Stuart
01x12,"Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.",Ted
01x12,"Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.",Lily
01x12,"Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.",Marshall
01x12,"Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.",Lily
01x12,Like you could possibly know that.,Marshall
01x12,I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.,Ted
01x12,Nice.,Lily
01x12,What? How?,Marshall
01x12,I talked to Stuart.,Ted
01x12,"Oh, you went around the bride. Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight. Did you known about this?",Marshall
01x12,It may have been my idea.,Lily
01x12,What? Stuart doesn't get a say.,Lily
01x12,"Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.",Marshall
01x12,"Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.",Lily
01x12,So I can invite whoever I want.,Marshall
01x12,"Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.",Lily
01x12,It's Claudia.,Ted
01x12,"So, it begins.",Marshall
01x12,"Come on, it can't be that bad.",Ted
01x12,"Here, Lily, you answer it.",Ted
01x12,What? Why?,Lily
01x12,Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.,Ted
01x12,But...but you're the guy...oh.,Lily
01x12,"Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?",Lily
01x12,"Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this.",Future Ted VO
01x12,"Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding.",Stuart
01x12,You what?,Claudia
01x12,I told him he could bring a date to the wedding.,Stuart
01x12,Always undermining me at every turn.,Claudia
01x12,"Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you.",Stuart
01x12,"And your mother, calling me all the time...",Claudia
01x12,"You know what, the wedding's off.",Stuart
01x12,They broke up.,Lily
01x12,Ow!,Ted
01x12,"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",Lily
01x12,"It's not because of me, is it?",Ted
01x12,Uh-huh.,Lily
01x12,"My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna kll me. He's gonna kll Ted, then I'm gonna kll Ted.",Claudia
01x12,It's Robin.,Ted
01x12,Answer it.,Lily
01x12,"Uh, Lily's phone.",Ted
01x12,Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.,Robin
01x12,"Uh, Lily's busy.",Ted
01x12,"Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.",Robin
01x12,"That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.",Ted
01x12,Bye-bye.,Robin
01x12,"Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?",Ted
01x12,"Ted, focus.",Marshall
01x12,"Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?",Lily
01x12,I wanna go somewhere and drink.,Claudia
01x12,"OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.",Lily
01x12,I feel terrible.,Ted
01x12,"Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.",Marshall
01x12,Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?,Ted
01x12,"She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father 400,000.",Lily
01x12,Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,Ted
01x12,"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.",Barney
01x12,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.",Barney
01x12,You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.,Claudia
01x12,"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",Barney
01x12,They all drink vodka cranberries.,Barney
01x12,"So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",Barney
01x12,"You got 400,000?",Claudia
01x12,"No, but I do have a hug.",Barney
01x12,Thank you.,Barney
01x12,"Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...",Ted
01x12,"Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me.",Stuart
01x12,"Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.",Marshall
01x12,"Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning prn.",Stuart
01x12,"Dude, who doesn't.",Marshall
01x12,"You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, why am I with Claudia? I can be with her.",Stuart
01x12,"That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...",Ted
01x12,"The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.",Stuart
01x12,"Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.",Ted
01x12,"How would you know, you're not even married?",Stuart
01x12,"OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.",Ted
01x12,"Stuart, don't get married.",Marshall
01x12,Dude.,Ted
01x12,What?,Stuart
01x12,"I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.",Marshall
01x12,"You know I don't have 400,000, right?",Ted
01x12,"That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.",Barney
01x12,"Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.",Barney
01x12,"Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.",Claudia
01x12,"Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.",Barney
01x12,"Oh, hell no.",Lily
01x12,Oww,Barney
01x12,"Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",Lily
01x12,"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.",Barney
01x12,"All right, all right.",Barney
01x12,Claudia.,Stuart
01x12,Stuart. I'm so sorry.,Claudia
01x12,I'm so sorry too.,Stuart
01x12,I love you.,Claudia
01x12,"I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize...",Stuart
01x12,Marshall said what?,Claudia
01x12,He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together.,Stuart
01x12,"So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?",Ted
01x12,Still wow.,Ted
01x12,Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.,Robin
01x12,"Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.",Ted
01x12,Sorry.,Robin
01x12,"Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin:  They want me to anchor the news tonight.",Robin
01x12,"Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.",Robin
01x12,Do it. Do it.,Ted
01x12,"OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...",Robin
01x12,"So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing.",Marshall
01x12,I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.,Lily
01x12,Crab puffs were incredible.,Marshall
01x12,We should totally have them at our wedding.,Lily
01x12,"Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.",Marshall
01x12,Did we just start planning our wedding?,Lily
01x12,I think we did.,Marshall
01x12,We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.,Lily
01x12,"Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.",Marshall
01x12,"My God, were you born without taste buds?",Lily
01x12,What?,Lily
01x12,I love you.,Marshall
01x12,"Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",Robin
01x12,"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.",Barney
01x12,What's a sixteen?,Ted
01x12,Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,Barney
01x12,Hi Ted.,Claudia
01x12,Claudia.,Ted
01x12,We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.,Claudia
01x12,"Yeah, where is she?",Stuart
01x12,Um  She couldn't make it.,Ted
01x12,"What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see.",Ted
01x12,"Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.",Ted
01x12,"Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.",Barney
01x12,"By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.",Claudia
01x12,I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.,Ted
01x12,I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,Ted
01x12,Being single's the best.,Barney
01x12,Stay out as late as you want.,Ted
01x12,Answer to no one.,Barney
01x12,The whole world full of endless possibilities.,Ted
01x12,Never having to go to a farmer's market.,Barney
01x12,"OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",Barney
01x12,"So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.",Future Ted VO
01x12,'Cause that night was just beginning.,Future Ted VO
01x13,"Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments, and they make life worth living. But here's the problem, moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven bstrd named reality.",Future Ted VO
01x13,"And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy.",Future Ted VO
01x13,"Wow, the Peace Corps?",Tanya
01x13,"Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, Is it? And usually they say, yes it is.",Barney
01x13,"Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.",Tanya
01x13,"Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.",Barney
01x13,This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out.,Future Ted VO
01x13,This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin. But then reality came along.,Future Ted VO
01x13,Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break.,Future Ted VO
01x13,"And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it...",Future Ted VO
01x13,"Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?",Lily
01x13,I had the most amazing night ever.,Ted
01x13,"Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.",Marshall
01x13,"Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake...",Lily
01x13,Say what?,Marshall
01x13,Lily.,Ted
01x13,"Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go.",Lily
01x13,"I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings.",Victoria
01x13,I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.,Ted
01x13,"Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real.",Victoria
01x13,"Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.",Ted
01x13,You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee.,Victoria
01x13,Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.,Ted
01x13,Wedding goggles.,Victoria
01x13,"Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.",Ted
01x13,This isn't the moves?,Victoria
01x13,"What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.",Ted
01x13,That's too bad.,Victoria
01x13,Tell me about it.,Ted
01x13,"You know, I think I have a solution.",Victoria
01x13,Interested.,Ted
01x13,"And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight.",Victoria
01x13,Less interested.,Ted
01x13,Go ahead.,Ted
01x13,"OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out.",Victoria
01x13,What are you saying?,Ted
01x13,"I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again.",Victoria
01x13,Unless...,Ted
01x13,"No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect.",Victoria
01x13,"Wow. OK, I'm in.",Ted
01x13,OK.,Victoria
01x13,"I guess, what, we'll need fake names?",Ted
01x13,"Um, you can call me Buttercup.",Victoria
01x13,"Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.",Ted
01x13,"Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...",Ted
01x13,"Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.",Barney
01x13,"So, I'm Ted.",Ted
01x13,Victoria. But no last names.,Victoria
01x13,No last names.,Ted
01x13,Oh.,Marshall
01x13,"Oh, what is wrong with you?",Lily
01x13,"Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.",Marshall
01x13,"No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.",Ted
01x13,"Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.",Marshall
01x13,"That cake really got to you, huh?",Ted
01x13,It haunts me.,Marshall
01x13,"So, what happened next?",Lily
01x13,Mm-hm.,Ted
01x13,Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.,Victoria
01x13,Wait wait wait wait wait.,Victoria
01x13,Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.,Victoria
01x13,"Yes, but we'll need a diversion.",Ted
01x13,Kiss.,Ted
01x13,"Go. Go, go, go",Ted
01x13,"So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.",Lily
01x13,You're not gonna do it at your wedding?,Ted
01x13,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.",Lily
01x13,"So, where did you guys go?",Marshall
01x13,Very nice.,Ted
01x13,Yeah?,Victoria
01x13,"OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance.",Victoria
01x13,I couldn't really tell.,Ted
01x13,"Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.",Ted
01x13,"Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.",Victoria
01x13,No you couldn't.,Ted
01x13,You're a dude. I could totally...,Victoria
01x13,Totally get some.,Ted
01x13,We're not gonna kiss tonight.,Victoria
01x13,"If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.",Victoria
01x13,I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,Ted
01x13,"OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.",Victoria
01x13,OK.,Ted
01x13,But we can't kiss.,Victoria
01x13,OK.,Ted
01x13,"A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",Marshall
01x13,"Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",Lily
01x13,"She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",Ted
01x13,"Dammit, I have to see her again.",Ted
01x13,Yes.,"Lily, Marshall"
01x13,"So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",Marshall
01x13,"Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",Ted
01x13,"Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",Lily
01x13,"Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",Ted
01x13,"No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",Lily
01x13,"Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",Marshall
01x13,Ted?,Claudia
01x13,"Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.",Claudia
01x13,"Oh, here we go.",Stuart
01x13,"24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?",Claudia
01x13,I've moved on.,Ted
01x13,"What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.",Claudia
01x13,"Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",Ted
01x13,"Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.",Claudia
01x13,Thank God.,Ted
01x13,"Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.",Claudia
01x13,There was no Victoria at the wedding.,Ted
01x13,"Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",Lily
01x13,"Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",Marshall
01x13,Marshall. She was not a ghost.,Ted
01x13,"I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",Marshall
01x13,"Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",Ted
01x13,Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,Lily
01x13,"This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",Barney
01x13,Barney.,Nirvana
01x13,Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,Barney
01x13,"Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",Ted
01x13,You know I did.,Barney
01x13,Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,Ted
01x13,You know I won't.,Barney
01x13,Why not?,Ted
01x13,"Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",Barney
01x13,"Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",Lily
01x13,"Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",Barney
01x13,"OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",Ted
01x13,Really? Ted: Yeah.,Barney
01x13,But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,Barney
01x13,I'm ready to be proven wrong.,Ted
01x13,Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.,Barney
01x13,"Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",Barney
01x13,What kind of shoes...,Barney
01x13,"Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",Barney
01x13,Actually.,Ted
01x13,Oh come on.,Barney
01x13,Hey.,Victoria
01x13,"So, what do you want to do next?",Ted
01x13,Uh...,Victoria
01x13,Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,Ted
01x13,Hold this.,Victoria
01x13,Whoa. There she goes.,Ted
01x13,Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,Barney
01x13,"Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",Barney
01x13,I understand.,Ted
01x13,"OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",Lily
01x13,Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,Marshall
01x13,"No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",Ted
01x13,Agreed.,Marshall
01x13,"And I thought that was the end of it, but then...",Future Ted VO
01x13,"Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",Lily
01x13,"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",Robin
01x13,"Congrats, that's so cool.",Lily
01x13,"Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",Robin
01x13,"Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",Lily
01x13,"And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it...",Future Ted VO
01x13,What?,Lily
01x13,I know who she is.,Robin
01x13,"You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",Lily
01x13,"Actually, I kind of was.",Robin
01x13,What?,Lily
01x13,"Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",Robin
01x13,Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,Robin
01x13,Hello? You OK in there?,Victoria
01x13,"Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",Robin
01x13,"Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.",Victoria
01x13,"Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",Robin
01x13,"Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?",Victoria
01x13,Because you have feelings for Ted.,Lily
01x13,"I don't know, maybe.",Robin
01x13,"OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",Lily
01x13,"Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",Robin
01x13,Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,Lily
01x13,"OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.",Robin
01x13,But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,Robin
01x13,Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,Lily
01x13,I'm gonna go find him.,Robin
01x13,"Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",Lily
01x13,I have no idea.,Robin
01x13,"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sx.",Barney
01x13,I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,Barney
01x13,"Hi, guys,",Robin
01x13,Hey.,Ted
01x13,"Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",Robin
01x13,Sure. What's up?,Ted
01x13,"Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",Robin
01x13,Oh.,Ted
01x13,"Oh, just get it.",Robin
01x13,Hello.,Ted
01x13,"Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you.",Stuart
01x13,Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost 10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!,Claudia
01x13,Sweet pea.,Stuart
01x13,Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.,Claudia
01x13,"It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",Ted
01x13,"Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",Ted
01x13,Cake.,Claudia
01x13,Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.,Victoria
01x13,"Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",Robin
01x13,We got it at this little bakery downtown.,Claudia
01x13,"Actually, neither.",Victoria
01x13,It's called the Buttercup Bakery.,Claudia
01x13,I made the cake.,Victoria
01x13,She made the cake.,Ted
01x13,Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.,Ted
01x13,"She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",Marshall
01x13,I'm going down to that bakery.,Ted
01x13,"No, no, don't do it.",Lily
01x13,"Baby, what are you talking about?!",Marshall
01x13,"Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",Ted
01x13,"Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin: Yes. Ted. Go get her.",Lily
01x13,Going. Getting.,Ted
01x13,"Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",Barney
01x13,Yes! No.,Ted
01x13,Oh come on!,Barney
01x13,Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.,Ted
01x13,"Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.",Victoria
01x13,"Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",Ted
01x13,"Wow, what was I thinking?",Victoria
01x13,"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",Ted
01x13,"You got me, you are good.",Victoria
01x13,"You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",Ted
01x13,The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.,Victoria
01x13,Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,Lily
01x13,"Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",Marshall
01x13,"Ted, you still with us?",Barney
01x13,Tell me your last name.,Ted
01x13,"You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",Ted
01x13,What's that?,Victoria
01x13,I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.,Ted
01x13,"Hey, Ted.",Victoria
01x13,Yeah?,Ted
01x13,"Close your eyes, and count to five.",Victoria
01x13,"One, two, three, four, five.",Ted
01x13,"And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",Ted
01x13,"The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",Barney
01x13,OK.,Ted
01x13,Oh thank God.,Victoria
01x14,"When you meet someone special, suddenly life is full of firsts. The first kiss. The first night together. The first weekend together. For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.",Ted from 2030
01x14,"They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",Marshall
01x14,Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.,Lily
01x14,Maybe they're not even in there.,Marshall
01x14,Good morning.,Victoria
01x14,"Hey, guys.",Ted
01x14,I'm just going to ignore that.,Victoria
01x14,Thank you!,Marshall
01x14,I wish you could stay.,Ted
01x14,"I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.",Victoria
01x14,Call you afterwards?,Ted
01x14,I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.,Victoria
01x14,Bye.,Ted
01x14,Two days straight?!,Marshall
01x14,"Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!",Lily
01x14,"Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits.",Marshall
01x14,Zero.,Ted
01x14,What?,Marshall
01x14,What?,Lily
01x14,"Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",Ted
01x14,Her idea.,Marshall
01x14,"Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.",Ted
01x14,I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.,Ted
01x14,I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.,Marshall
01x14,You've only had sx with one girl in your whole life.,Ted
01x14,Burn!,Lily
01x14,"Ted, the only reason to wait a month for sx is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",Barney
01x14,Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?,Robin
01x14,"Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",Ted
01x14,"No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.",Lily
01x14,"Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.",Robin
01x14,Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.,Lily
01x14,It's one of New York Magazine's Top five romantic getaways on a budget. Who says sexual can't be sensible?,Marshall
01x14,"Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.",Robin
01x14,Really?,Barney
01x14,"Actually, I was talking to my martini.",Robin
01x14,Ready to go?,Marshall
01x14,"Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.",Lily
01x14,Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp.,Marshall
01x14,Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.,Lily
01x14,Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.,Marshall
01x14,"Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.",Lily
01x14,And it's supposed to rain tonight.,Marshall
01x14,Or we could just stay home.,Lily
01x14,Maybe watch some TV.,Marshall
01x14,Order in some Chinese.,Lily
01x14,"Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?",Marshall
01x14,"Hell, yeah.",Lily
01x14,"Good, cause this thing's empty.",Marshall
01x14,"Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say wow.",Barney
01x14,"Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.",Robin
01x14,It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.,Barney
01x14,Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?,Robin
01x14,You can't just... Wow!,Barney
01x14,Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.,Robin
01x14,"Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a bro for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?",Barney
01x14,"Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.",Robin
01x14,So... one more week and it'll be a month.,Victoria
01x14,"Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",Ted
01x14,"Oh, come on.",Victoria
01x14,The 18th can't get here fast enough.,Ted
01x14,"Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!",Victoria
01x14,"Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",Ted
01x14,Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.,Victoria
01x14,75th and Amsterdam.,Ted
01x14,I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.,Lily
01x14,"Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",Marshall
01x14,And yet we'd feel obligated to have sx.,Lily
01x14,"Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",Marshall
01x14,I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.,Ted
01x14,I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.,Victoria
01x14,"Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",Lily
01x14,"They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",Marshall
01x14,"But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",Lily
01x14,They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.,Marshall
01x14,But I don't want to hide out in here.,Lily
01x14,"Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have sx with Ted, and... not going to be me.",Marshall
01x14,"Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",Lily
01x14,You suited up!,Barney
01x14,"Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",Robin
01x14,Emilio? The woman will have...,Barney
01x14,"I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",Robin
01x14,"Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. The Torpedo. Or, as the rollers call it, Piramide.",Barney
01x14,"My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",Robin
01x14,Father issues. Hot.,Barney
01x14,I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,Robin
01x14,"Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",Barney
01x14,"Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have sx to get pregnant.",Robin
01x14,What up! Freeze frame high five!,Barney
01x14,I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.,Victoria
01x14,"No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",Ted
01x14,"Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",Lily
01x14,And they're not even high.,Marshall
01x14,It's actually working.,Lily
01x14,"Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had sx three times by now.",Marshall
01x14,"Yeah, try five.",Lily
01x14,What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,Marshall
01x14,No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,Lily
01x14,Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,Marshall
01x14,"I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?",Victoria
01x14,"Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",Lily
01x14,So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,Robin
01x14,Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,Barney
01x14,What?,Robin
01x14,There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,Barney
01x14,"Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",Robin
01x14,"Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",Barney
01x14,"Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",Robin
01x14,"Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",Barney
01x14,Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,Robin
01x14,He's just staring into her eyes.,Marshall
01x14,"I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",Lily
01x14,Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,Marshall
01x14,"No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",Lily
01x14,"Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",Marshall
01x14,"Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, Want to do it? And I say, Yeah.",Lily
01x14,Want to...,Marshall
01x14,No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,Lily
01x14,Looks like they're about to have theirs.,Marshall
01x14,Should we take this to the bedroom?,Ted
01x14,Yes!,Marshall
01x14,Yes!,Lily
01x14,Yes.,Victoria
01x14,Yes!,Marshall
01x14,Yes!,Lily
01x14,"No. No, don't answer it!",Marshall
01x14,You can answer it. We have all night.,Victoria
01x14,You're answering it? He's answering it!,Marshall
01x14,No! Do her! Do her now!,Lily
01x14,Sure. Good luck with that.  Sorry about that.,Ted
01x14,How about a little more wine?,Victoria
01x14,I'll get another bottle.,Ted
01x14,I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,Lily
01x14,Shh...,Marshall
01x14,"Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",Robin
01x14,No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,Barney
01x14,But I...,Robin
01x14,"Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",Barney
01x14,See you on the other side.,Robin
01x14,Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,Barney
01x14,Yeah.,Robin
01x14,All right.,Barney
01x14,"Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",Lily
01x14,"Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",Marshall
01x14,"Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",Lily
01x14,It's all right. We can do this.,Marshall
01x14,Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,Lily
01x14,You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,Marshall
01x14,"All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",Lily
01x14,"Well, we can't.",Marshall
01x14,"Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",Lily
01x14,What is it?,Marshall
01x14,I have to pee.,Lily
01x14,This is bad.,Marshall
01x14,Yeah.,Lily
01x14,We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,Marshall
01x14,"Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",Lily
01x14,How much longer do you think you can hold it?,Marshall
01x14,I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,Lily
01x14,"Oh, boy.",Marshall
01x14,Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,Robin
01x14,Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,Barney
01x14,"Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",Robin
01x14,Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,Barney
01x14,"Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",Robin
01x14,"Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",Barney
01x14,That's a woman.,Robin
01x14,"Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",Barney
01x14,Let's just focus on your target.,Robin
01x14,Right.,Barney
01x14,"Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",Robin
01x14,Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...,Woman
01x14,"Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",Robin
01x14,Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.,Woman
01x14,"Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",Robin
01x14,We'll see about that.,Woman
01x14,"Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",Lily
01x14,"Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",Marshall
01x14,"No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",Lily
01x14,"Well, you have farted in front of me.",Marshall
01x14,"Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",Lily
01x14,You always do.,Marshall
01x14,Hey.,Barney
01x14,Hey.,Robin
01x14,Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,Barney
01x14,What happened?,Robin
01x14,"Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",Barney
01x14,But why?,Robin
01x14,Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,Barney
01x14,"Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",Robin
01x14,Hit!,Barney
01x14,"Ted, I can't wait any longer.",Victoria
01x14,Should we move to the bedroom?,Ted
01x14,There's no time for that.,Victoria
01x14,"They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",Marshall
01x14,"Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",Lily
01x14,I know.,Marshall
01x14,"I love you, Marshall.",Lily
01x14,"I love you, Lily.",Marshall
01x14,"Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",Barney
01x14,"Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",Robin
01x14,Hard-core? That's the only way I play.,Barney
01x14,I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,Robin
01x14,"I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",Barney
01x14,No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,Robin
01x14,"Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",Barney
01x14,What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,Robin
01x14,You invited me up to your apartment to play Battleship. Is that not an internationally recognized term for sx?,Barney
01x14,No.,Robin
01x14,Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,Barney
01x14,I'm okay. You okay?,Lily
01x14,"I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",Marshall
01x14,"I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",Lily
01x14,"You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",Marshall
01x14,"Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",Lily
01x14,They must have heard that.,Marshall
01x14,"Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",Lily
01x14,Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,Marshall
01x14,"Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",Robin
01x14,"But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",Barney
01x14,"Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",Robin
01x14,I checked with Ted.,Barney
01x14,"Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",Barney
01x14,Sure. Good luck with that.,Ted
01x14,Totally gave us his blessing.,Barney
01x14,Really?,Robin
01x14,Really.,Barney
01x14,So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,Robin
01x14,Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,Barney
01x14,What?,Robin
01x14,You like Ted.,Barney
01x14,I didn't say I liked Ted.,Robin
01x14,You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,Barney
01x14,"Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",Robin
01x14,"Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",Barney
01x14,"You're not gonna tell him, are you?",Robin
01x14,No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,Barney
01x14,A-7.,Robin
01x14,Miss.,Barney
01x14,Of course.,Robin
01x14,"Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",Marshall
01x14,Not making me feel better.,Lily
01x14,"Well, it certainly was a first.",Marshall
01x14,"It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",Lily
01x14,"Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",Marshall
01x14,"Marshall, what makes you cry?",Lily
01x14,This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,Marshall
01x14,"Oh, just grab my boob already.",Lily
01x14,"Come on, guys, get a room.",Ted
01x15,"Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker!",Ted from 2030
01x15,You don't have to shout out poker when you win.,Ted
01x15,I know. It's just fun to say.,Marshall
01x15,"We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, invent your own game.",Ted from 2030
01x15,"It's called Marsh-gammon. It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",Marshall
01x15,"Backgammon, obviously.",Robin
01x15,"No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the gammon, and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",Marshall
01x15,I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,Lily
01x15,I'm going to go get another round.,Robin
01x15,"Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",Ted
01x15,"Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",Barney
01x15,No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,Ted
01x15,"Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",Lily
01x15,"Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",Ted
01x15,Us? What would we do?,Lily
01x15,"Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",Ted
01x15,Fine.,Marshall
01x15,Fine.,Lily
01x15,Thank you.,Ted
01x15,I should go help Robin.,Lily
01x15,Hey.,Robin
01x15,"Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",Lily
01x15,"Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, She's great too many times, didn't I?",Robin
01x15,You must really hate the bitch.,Lily
01x15,"But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you Marshall out, and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question What?, then... you got to drink. Got it?",Marshall
01x15,No,All
01x15,"Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",Marshall
01x15,Okay.,Victoria
01x15,"Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.",Marshall
01x15,"Marshall, come on.",Ted
01x15,"Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, Have you ever cheated while in a relationship? Wow, good question.",Marshall
01x15,You don't have to answer that.,Ted
01x15,"It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.",Victoria
01x15,"Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",Marshall
01x15,"So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",Barney
01x15,What?,Victoria
01x15,"You said what, you got to drink!",Marshall
01x15,"Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",Lily
01x15,"Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.",Barney
01x15,"Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",Lily
01x15,Where's the tape?,Barney
01x15,Fine. I'll go get it.,Lily
01x15,"Cool, okay. You know, whenever.",Barney
01x15,"Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!",Marshall
01x15,Of course.,Ted
01x15,"Victoria, How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?",Marshall
01x15,"Wait, the card actually says Ted?",Ted
01x15,"Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.",Victoria
01x15,Prude alert.,Robin
01x15,Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between.,Victoria
01x15,"Oh, slut alert!",Robin
01x15,"Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.",Barney
01x15,Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.,Marshall
01x15,"Barney, what was on that tape?",Lily
01x15,Too bad you'll never find out.,Barney
01x15,"Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.",Lily
01x15,What?!,Barney
01x15,Drink!,Marshall
01x15,"Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?",Lily
01x15,"Give it to me, give it, give me...",Barney
01x15,"Play the tape, play it, play it!",Ted
01x15,"Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...",Barney
01x15,Did you try his cell phone?,Marshall
01x15,"Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.",Ted
01x15,"Hey, guys, what up?",Barney
01x15,"Barney, where have you been?",Robin
01x15,"Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.",Ted
01x15,"Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.",Lily
01x15,Come on. Stay!,All
01x15,"I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.",Barney
01x15,"Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.",Marshall
01x15,"Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",Barney
01x15,All right.,Marshall
01x15,"I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",Marshall
01x15,The kids still call him Funny Butt.,Lily
01x15,"Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.",Barney
01x15,"It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh. Thank you. All right.",Barney
01x15,"I love your singing, Barney.",Shannon
01x15,"And I love you, Shannon.",Barney
01x15,Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.,Shannon
01x15,I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.,Barney
01x15,"Hey, nonfat latte to go.",Man
01x15,"Mellow order, bro, mellow order.",Barney
01x15,"Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!",Man
01x15,"Sorry, I only give high twos.",Barney
01x15,Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.,Man
01x15,"Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.",Barney
01x15,"Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.",Man
01x15,"I feel sorry for you, man.",Barney
01x15,"Peace out, hombre.",Man
01x15,"Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.",Barney
01x15,She never showed?,Robin
01x15,"So, what happened next?",Ted
01x15,You know what? This was a mistake.,Barney
01x15,Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?,Lily
01x15,"Oh, I know just how to decide who.",Marshall
01x15,You brought the game to the bar?,Lily
01x15,"Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.",Marshall
01x15,I was winning?,Ted
01x15,Fine. I'll go next.,Robin
01x15,I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.,Robin
01x15,Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!,Barney
01x15,"Yeah, we all know that one.",Ted
01x15,"Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.",Victoria
01x15,"Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!",Marshall
01x15,"Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.",Victoria
01x15,"Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories, but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one. Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.",Ted from 2030
01x15,That is the greatest story ever!,Marshall
01x15,Oh my God!,Lily
01x15,"Wow, wow!",Ted
01x15,"Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.",Barney
01x15,I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.,Barney
01x15,Barney.,Shannon
01x15,"Sugar Bear, where were you?",Barney
01x15,"Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.",Shannon
01x15,But the Nicaraguans need us!,Barney
01x15,"It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me.",Shannon
01x15,"Shannon, there is no...",Barney
01x15,"Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.",Shannon
01x15,"As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.",Barney
01x15,Now we all got to drink.,Marshall
01x15,"Oh, my God. What happened next?",Ted
01x15,"I don't know, guys.",Barney
01x15,"Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies...",Lily
01x15,"Lily, no!",Marshall
01x15,"For the team, Marshall, for the team.",Lily
01x15,"Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care.",Lily
01x15,"Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?",Marshall
01x15,"Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.",Lily
01x15,So we've got the whole place to ourselves.,Marshall
01x15,I'm thinking floor sx.,Lily
01x15,Sounds reasonable.,Marshall
01x15,"Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.",Lily
01x15,The whole time?,Robin
01x15,The... whole... time.,Lily
01x15,"Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.",Marshall
01x15,"Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.",Barney
01x15,"How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!",Barney
01x15,"Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.",Shannon
01x15,We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?,Barney
01x15,"Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.",Shannon
01x15,But I love you.,Barney
01x15,But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.,Shannon
01x15,"I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!",Barney
01x15,I'm just picking up my last paycheck.,Shannon
01x15,Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?,Barney
01x15,"Oh, she got the tape.",Man
01x15,You? It was you?,Barney
01x15,"Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man.",Man
01x15,"Oh, you poor thing.",Lily
01x15,The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.,Barney
01x15,When?,Robin
01x15,Sorry.,Marshall
01x15,You've got to tell us.,Lily
01x15,"I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.",Barney
01x15,Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...,Ted
01x15,"Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",Barney
01x15,"You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, I love you. Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",Ted
01x15,We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,Ted
01x15,To one hell of a night!,Ranjit
01x15,"And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.",Ted
01x15,Yes! Do it!,Barney
01x15,To the cab.,Ranjit
01x15,Hello? Is someone out there?,Robin
01x15,You ralphed and ran?,Lily
01x15,I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?,Marshall
01x15,You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.,Robin
01x15,Sorry.,Ted
01x15,It's okay.,Robin
01x15,"Victoria, I know this must be...",Ted
01x15,Yeah. It kind of is.,Victoria
01x15,"Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.",Barney
01x15,"Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.",Marshall
01x15,"Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.",Barney
01x15,Hi.,Barney
01x15,Barney?,Shannon
01x15,"Hi, Shannon.",Barney
01x15,What are you doing here?,Shannon
01x15,"Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",Barney
01x15,"She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.",Barney
01x15,"Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",Lily
01x15,"My life rocks! Money, suits and sx. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bllet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",Barney
01x15,Nope.,Lily
01x15,Yeah.,Barney
01x15,Nope.,Lily
01x15,Yeah.,Barney
01x15,"Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",Lily
01x15,"Oh, Barney!",Shannon
01x15,"Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",Barney
01x15,Is your phone on?,Shannon
01x15,"Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",Barney
01x15,"Ew, gross. Just stop it.",Lily
01x15,"Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",Barney
01x15,I think Barney just won game night.,Marshall
01x15,"We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story.",Ted from 2030
01x16,"Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.",Ted from 2030
01x16,My first solo batch.,Ted
01x16,"Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.",Victoria
01x16,"Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.",Ted from 2030
01x16,"Um, are you coloring in your butt?",Barney
01x16,"I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.",Marshall
01x16,So wear another one.,Barney
01x16,I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,Marshall
01x16,"Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",Barney
01x16,"Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",Marshall
01x16,"Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",Barney
01x16,"A tailor? Barney, I make negative 300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",Marshall
01x16,"Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks suit. Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",Barney
01x16,"No thanks, dude.  Noon?",Marshall
01x16,Noon. See you then.,Barney
01x16,"Hey, girls.",Victoria
01x16,Hey.,Robin and Lily
01x16,"Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.",Victoria
01x16,"Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.",Robin
01x16,Robin!,Lily
01x16,"Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.",Robin
01x16,Really? Oh.,Victoria
01x16,"Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",Robin
01x16,"What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.",Victoria
01x16,Really? That'd be great.,Lily
01x16,Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.,Victoria
01x16,"Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",Robin
01x16,"Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",Lily
01x16,The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,Robin
01x16,"Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",Lily
01x16,I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.,Victoria
01x16,"Wait. Germany, Europe?",Ted
01x16,"It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.",Victoria
01x16,"So, this is the Europe Germany?",Ted
01x16,What other Germany would it be?,Victoria
01x16,The one in Epcot?,Ted
01x16,Ted.,Victoria
01x16,Sorry. Congratulations.,Ted
01x16,Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.,Victoria
01x16,"Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",Ted
01x16,I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.,Victoria
01x16,"Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",Ted
01x16,"So, that leaves us with...",Victoria
01x16,"Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",Ted
01x16,I have to leave on Monday.,Victoria
01x16,"Monday, September the...?",Ted
01x16,Ted. Do you have any thoughts?,Victoria
01x16,Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,Ted
01x16,It's a date.,Victoria
01x16,And that's when things got complicated.,Ted from 2030
01x16,"Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",Marshall
01x16,Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,Lily
01x16,"Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",Marshall
01x16,"Well, good luck, baby.",Lily
01x16,"Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",Marshall
01x16,"Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",Barney
01x16,You speak Ukrainian?,Marshall
01x16,"Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",Ted
01x16,"No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no sx. kll me now.",Marshall
01x16,Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,Barney
01x16,Really? You?,Ted
01x16,"Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",Barney
01x16,"Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",Marshall
01x16,Yeah.,Ted
01x16,"Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face. Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",Marshall
01x16,"Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",Ted
01x16,"Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost klled us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",Marshall
01x16,"Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",Ted
01x16,"Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",Marshall
01x16,"Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",Ted
01x16,Are you sure?,Barney
01x16,All right.,Ted
01x16,Hello.,Victoria
01x16,"Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",Ted
01x16,"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",Victoria
01x16,"Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",Ted
01x16,"Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",Barney
01x16,"Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",Marshall
01x16,Here. Play with this pin cushion.,Barney
01x16,God. I'm going to look hot.,Marshall
01x16,"Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",Barney
01x16,No way. The Kid does not sell out.,Marshall
01x16,"Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",Barney
01x16,No. I've made my decision.,Marshall
01x16,"So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",Ted
01x16,And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.,Ted from 2030
01x16,"All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.",Victoria
01x16,I want you to stay.,Ted
01x16,Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,Marshall
01x16,"Oh, good luck, baby.",Lily
01x16,Bye.,Marshall
01x16,"Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?",Woman
01x16,Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,Lily
01x16,I saw a couple up front that were nice.,Robin
01x16,Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,Lily
01x16,"Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.",Victoria
01x16,Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,Lily
01x16,At least we get free champagne!,Victoria
01x16,And cake.,Robin
01x16,Mm-hmm.,Victoria
01x16,"Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",Robin
01x16,"You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.",Victoria
01x16,Ugh. All talking and no sx. kll me now.,Lily
01x16,"I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.",Victoria
01x16,"Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",Robin
01x16,But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.,Victoria
01x16,"Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",Robin
01x16,I really don't...,Victoria
01x16,"sx. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bstrd's kicked.",Robin
01x16,Thanks.,Woman
01x16,Oh!,Victoria and Robin
01x16,"It's okay, guys, I hate it.",Lily
01x16,Just horrible.,Victoria
01x16,"It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",Robin
01x16,"You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",Lily
01x16,But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.,Victoria
01x16,"Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?",Ted
01x16,"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",Victoria
01x16,A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,Robin
01x16,Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?,Victoria
01x16,Maybe he's going to buy you one.,Lily
01x16,I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?,Victoria
01x16,Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,Robin
01x16,That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?,Victoria
01x16,"Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",Robin
01x16,Aw.,Victoria and Robin
01x16,"Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",Lily
01x16,"Ugly, ugly, ugly.",Robin
01x16,"I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.",Victoria
01x16,Are you okay?,Lily
01x16,I'm fine.,Robin
01x16,Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,Lily
01x16,"I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",Robin
01x16,"Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",Lily
01x16,Somebody say beautiful princess.,Victoria
01x16,"Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",Lily
01x16,"Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.",Victoria
01x16,I know what you mean.,Robin
01x16,You do?,Victoria
01x16,"Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",Lily
01x16,"See, that's what I'm afraid of.",Victoria
01x16,Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,Robin
01x16,Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.,Victoria
01x16,"Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",Robin
01x16,"No, you are.",Victoria
01x16,"Okay, I am.",Robin
01x16,I'm going to stay.,Victoria
01x16,Aw.,Victoria and Robin
01x16,"Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",Lily
01x16,"Wow, you look incredible.",Robin
01x16,"Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",Lily
01x16,"Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",Robin
01x16,"Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married.  Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",Lily
01x16,"Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",Robin
01x16,"But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.",Victoria
01x16,"Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",Robin
01x16,It was like this when I found it?,Lily
01x16,And how will you be paying for this?,Woman
01x16,Credit card... s.,Lily
01x16,"I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.",Victoria
01x16,I want you to stay.,Ted
01x16,I have to go to Germany.,Victoria
01x16,You're going?,Ted
01x16,Yes. I have to.,Victoria
01x16,So that's what you decided?,Ted
01x16,"Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.",Victoria
01x16,"What is this, opposite day or something?",Ted
01x16,No.,Victoria
01x16,So it is?,Ted
01x16,"Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.",Victoria
01x16,"I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",Ted
01x16,"Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?",Victoria
01x16,"Well, that's just crazy.",Ted
01x16,"Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.",Victoria
01x16,But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,Ted
01x16,You'd have me.,Victoria
01x16,"We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",Ted
01x16,So... we're breaking up?,Victoria
01x16,I guess so. I guess so.,Ted
01x16,"God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",Marshall
01x16,"It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",Ted
01x16,"Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",Marshall
01x16,She's leaving tomorrow.,Ted
01x16,"Yeah, but she's still in town.",Marshall
01x16,"Yeah, she... she's still in town.",Ted
01x16,"Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?",Marshall
01x16,"Awesome air kicks, huh?",Ted
01x16,New pajama bottoms?,Marshall
01x16,You know it.,Ted
01x16,"So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",Ted
01x16,"Wait, so we're sharing the leg?",Victoria
01x16,"No, the leg is a metaphor.",Ted
01x16,"How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.",Victoria
01x16,"Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",Ted
01x16,"Well, what would you want to do?",Victoria
01x16,Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,Ted
01x16,Like go to the Mets.,Victoria
01x16,"Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",Ted
01x16,See some monkeys at the zoo?,Victoria
01x16,Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,Ted
01x16,Wow! We better get going.,Victoria
01x16,"Yeah, big day.",Ted
01x16,Yeah.,Victoria
01x16,"And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things.",Ted from 2030
01x16,"Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",Robin
01x16,"No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",Lily
01x16,"Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",Robin
01x16,"Yeah, but only, like, second base.",Lily
01x16,"Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.",Barney
01x16,"Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",Marshall
01x16,"So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",Barney
01x16,"Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",Marshall
01x16,"Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",Barney
01x16,"B... Barney, this says 4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",Marshall
01x16,"Yeah, must be a 12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",Barney
01x16,You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,Marshall
01x16,I most certainly did...,Barney
01x16,"Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",Marshall
01x16,"I destroyed an 8,000 wedding dress.",Lily
01x16,What time is the interview?,Marshall
01x16,"9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.",Barney
01x16,I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.,Victoria
01x16,"Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sx.",Ted
01x16,I'm going to miss you so much.,Victoria
01x16,"I'm going to miss you, too.",Ted
01x16,"Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...",Victoria
01x16,Even if we're not.,Ted
01x16,Okay.,Victoria
01x16,"Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",Ted
01x16,Yes. Yes!,Victoria
01x16,We can beat the odds.,Ted
01x16,"Odds, schmodds.",Victoria
01x16,It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.,Ted
01x16,"It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later.",Ted from 2030
01x17,"When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old, he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas. It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.",Ted from 2030
01x17,What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?,Marshall
01x17,So you want to be an anthropologist?,Dr. Birnholz
01x17,"Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.",Marshall
01x17,What she said next changed his life.,Ted from 2030
01x17,"Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't. They'll all be dead by then...",Dr. Birnholz
01x17,"...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.",Marshall
01x17,So you don't want coffee.,Ted
01x17,I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...,Marshall
01x17,All right. I'm pouring it out.,Ted
01x17,"Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.",Marshall
01x17,I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. The kid has become the man.,Ted
01x17,"Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.",Marshall
01x17,Well... I mean... they did their best.,Ted from 2030
01x17,Here's your sack lunch.,Lily
01x17,"Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word sack.",Marshall
01x17,"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
01x17,I love you.,Marshall
01x17,"I love you too, Marshmallow.",Ted
01x17,Uh-oh. Ted?,Marshall
01x17,"Oh, no. No, she didn't.",Ted
01x17,"Yeah. Yeah, she did.",Marshall
01x17,Another care package?,Ted
01x17,Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.,Ted from 2030
01x17,How many is that so far?,Marshall
01x17,Three.,Ted
01x17,And how many have you sent her?,Lily
01x17,"In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.",Ted
01x17,"God, that is so me at 15.",Marshall
01x17,"Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there.",Ted from 2030
01x17,Go for Barney.,Barney
01x17,"Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.",Voice
01x17,A sasquatch?,Barney
01x17,"That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.",Voice
01x17,Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.,Barney
01x17,Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.,Marshall
01x17,"Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...",Barney
01x17,There's one for awesomeness?,Marshall
01x17,"Yeah, I had it made. Sit.",Barney
01x17,"Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?",Marshall
01x17,Please.,Barney
01x17,My dawg!,Man  1
01x17,My dawg!,Man  2
01x17,"Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.",Barney
01x17,Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.,Marshall
01x17,Nice tie. Steak sauce.,Bilson
01x17,"Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.",Blauman
01x17,"Where, I don't, I don't see...",Marshall
01x17,Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.,Barney
01x17,"Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?",Bilson
01x17,I don't have a back door.,Marshall
01x17,"Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise. Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.",Bilson
01x17,"Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--",Marshall
01x17,Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.,Bilson
01x17,"We're still engaged, even if she's...",Marshall
01x17,"Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.",Bilson
01x17,Sure you don't want one?,Ted
01x17,How many of those have you eaten?,Robin
01x17,"Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.",Ted
01x17,"Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!",Ted
01x17,"So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.",Ted
01x17,"Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.",Ted
01x17,Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.,Ted
01x17,"Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
01x17,"Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.",Ted
01x17,"All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some HH bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.",Robin
01x17,"That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.",Ted
01x17,That is funny.,Robin
01x17,And here's why it was funny.,Ted from 2030
01x17,"Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.",Ted from 2030
01x17,"Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.",Robin
01x17,"Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.",Ted
01x17,"The irony is clear, Ted.",Robin
01x17,Hey! How was your first day?,Lily
01x17,I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.,Marshall
01x17,What?,Lily
01x17,They're jerks!,Marshall
01x17,What makes them jerks?,Lily
01x17,"Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch..",Marshall
01x17,"What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?",Bilson
01x17,"For your information, my fiancee did.",Marshall
01x17,"Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?",Blauman
01x17,No.,Marshall
01x17,What's that?,Blauman
01x17,Nothing. Give it.,Marshall
01x17,Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad.,Bilson
01x17,Give it.,Marshall
01x17,"P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it.",Bilson
01x17,"Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!",Marshall
01x17,"Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.",Lily
01x17,"I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable.",Marshall
01x17,"Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.",Lily
01x17,I quit.,Marshall
01x17,"What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",Barney
01x17,"We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?",Marshall
01x17,Please.,Barney
01x17,"I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",Marshall
01x17,"Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.",Barney
01x17,What?,Marshall
01x17,Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,Barney
01x17,The package?,Marshall
01x17,The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,Barney
01x17,Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,Marshall
01x17,"Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",Barney
01x17,She'll be happy.,Marshall
01x17,Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,Barney
01x17,And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.,Bilson
01x17,"I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.",Marshall
01x17,"Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.",Bilson
01x17,"So, did she get the awesome care package yet?",Robin
01x17,Yep. Yesterday.,Ted
01x17,Did she love it?,Robin
01x17,"Ooh, she loved it.",Ted
01x17,So what's the problem?,Robin
01x17,"So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.",Ted
01x17,What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.,Ted
01x17,"Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
01x17,"I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.",Ted
01x17,It's pretty clear.,Robin
01x17,I have to go to Germany and surprise her.,Ted
01x17,"Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!",Robin
01x17,"Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?",Marshall
01x17,"Marshall, consider the penguins.",Barney
01x17,The penguins?,Marshall
01x17,On the wall.,Barney
01x17,Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold. This is a motivational poster?,Marshall
01x17,"Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",Barney
01x17,"Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",Lily
01x17,"Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",Marshall
01x17,It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,Lily
01x17,"No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.",Marshall
01x17,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.",Lily
01x17,I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.,Marshall
01x17,"All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?",Lily
01x17,Only when I'm drunk.,Marshall
01x17,Good boy.,Lily
01x17,"And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.",Ted from 2030
01x17,"Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.",Barney
01x17,"Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.",Marshall
01x17,"Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.",Barney
01x17,I'm psyched!,Marshall
01x17,"What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",Barney
01x17,"Wow, that was really specific.",Marshall
01x17,Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,Barney
01x17,So badly.,Marshall
01x17,And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.,Barney
01x17,Right. Get what done?,Marshall
01x17,Whatever.,Barney
01x17,Cool. And what guy is this?,Marshall
01x17,There's always a guy.,Barney
01x17,"Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.",Marshall
01x17,You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?,Barney
01x17,"All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs. So I'm, like, Snapadoo! So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.",Marshall
01x17,Eriksen...that was steak sauce!,Blauman
01x17,Great story.,Bilson
01x17,"The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.",Ted from 2030
01x17,Uh-oh.,Ted
01x17,"Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night. This long-distance thing sucks, huh? Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight. I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria. So?",Victoria's voice
01x17,"So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, Listen, I've been thinking, and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?",Ted
01x17,"I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.",Robin
01x17,"Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?",Ted
01x17,I'd wait.,Robin
01x17,"'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.",Marshall
01x17,Okay...what do you think?,Lily
01x17,Steak sauce.,Marshall
01x17,Steak sauce?,Lily
01x17,Yeah.,Marshall
01x17,"Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here.",Lily
01x17,"Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...",Marshall
01x17,"No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.",Lily
01x17,Why?,Marshall
01x17,"Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.",Lily
01x17,"Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?",Marshall
01x17,Okay.,Lily
01x17,"But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go.",Blauman
01x17,"Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah.",Bilson
01x17,You're right. They're delightful.,Lily
01x17,"So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?",Marshall
01x17,Nah. I'm so over karaoke.,Barney
01x17,Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,Marshall
01x17,"Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",Barney
01x17,"Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do Don't Go Breaking My Heart.",Lily
01x17,What?,Bilson
01x17,"Don't Go Breaking My Heart. Elton John, Kiki Dee.",Marshall
01x17,No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.,Bilson
01x17,"Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.",Lily
01x17,Iron Man. I could do Iron Man.,Marshall
01x17,Steak sauce.,Blauman
01x17,"Steak sauce, dude.",Bilson
01x17,"Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes!",Blauman
01x17,That's my man!,Bilson
01x17,"I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office.",Blauman
01x17,"Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?",Lily
01x17,"Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.",Marshall
01x17,"The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.",Lily
01x17,"Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.",Marshall
01x17,"Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.",Lily
01x17,Hello.,Robin
01x17,Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
01x17,"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
01x17,"No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
01x17,"I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.",Robin
01x17,"Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg.",Ted
01x17,"And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.",Ted from 2030
01x17,I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.,Ted
01x17,"He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...",Barney
01x17,Marshall.,Ted
01x17,"Hey, hey.",Marshall
01x17,"Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.",Ted
01x17,Yeah. Yeah. How you doing?,Marshall
01x17,I think Victoria's about to break up with me.,Ted
01x17,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.",Marshall
01x17,"Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.",Ted
01x17,Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.,Marshall
01x17,"I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",Ted
01x17,"Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap... Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?",Barney
01x17,Don't go breakin' my heart,Marshall
01x17,I couldn't if I tried,Lily
01x17,"Honey, if I get restless",Marshall
01x17,"Baby, you're not that kind...",Lily
01x17,"It turns out some things are worth preserving. But here's the real question: It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany, who was supposed to call four hours ago. And then the phone rings.",Ted from 2030
01x17,Hello.,Ted
01x17,"Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?",Robin
01x17,What do you do? Go.,Ted from 2030
01x18,Previously on How I Met Your Mother...,Ted from 2030
01x18,She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and...,Ted
01x18,You have feelings for Ted.,Lily
01x18,Maybe.,Robin
01x18,I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.,Victoria
01x18,Do you want to try long distance?,Ted
01x18,Yes.,Victoria
01x18,"This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.",Robin
01x18,She's going to dump me!,Ted
01x18,"She's not going to break up with you, Ted.",Robin
01x18,Hello?,Ted
01x18,Do you want to come over?,Robin
01x18,"Kids, your grandma always used to say to me, Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m., and she was right. When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep. Case in point:",Ted from 2030
01x18,Hello.,Ted
01x18,"Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?",Robin
01x18,Let's back up a little bit.,Ted from 2030
01x18,"Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight.",Robin
01x18,"And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?",Robin
01x18,Do you have a fianc?,Little Girl
01x18,Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word fianc.,Lily
01x18,"Oh, no, I don't have a fianc.",Robin
01x18,Then who do you live with?,Little Girl
01x18,"Well, actually, I've got five dogs.",Robin
01x18,Don't you get lonely?,Little Girl
01x18,"No, I've got five dogs.",Robin
01x18,My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.,Little Girl
01x18,"Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...",Robin
01x18,Does anyone else have a...? Yes?,Robin
01x18,Are you a lesbian?,Little Boy
01x18,No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...,Robin
01x18,"Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...",Lily
01x18,"So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.",Barney
01x18,"Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.",Robin
01x18,He has a job doing... What do you do?,Lily
01x18,"Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?",Barney
01x18,No.,All
01x18,No. I know what you want. Magic.,Barney
01x18,Hello.,Robin
01x18,Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
01x18,"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
01x18,"What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
01x18,I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.,Robin
01x18,And we're clear.,Director
01x18,"So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?",Man
01x18,"No, and why does this keep coming up today?",Robin
01x18,"Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...",Man
01x18,"What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things.",Robin
01x18,We should have sx.,Man
01x18,What?,Robin
01x18,"Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.",Man
01x18,"Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with.",Robin
01x18,"Get involved? Who said get involved? I'm just saying we should have sx, it could be fun.",Man
01x18,Having sx is fun.,Ted from 2030
01x18,Home number. Call me anytime. A lot of local teens in action tonight...,Man
01x18,"Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?",Robin
01x18,"Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.",Ted
01x18,Do you want to come over?,Robin
01x18,Why? What's up?,Ted
01x18,"Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, You know who likes juice? Ted.",Robin
01x18,I love juice.,Ted
01x18,Great. So you want to come over and make juice?,Robin
01x18,"When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.",Ted from 2030
01x18,"Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.",Ted
01x18,"Yes, we'll juice.",Robin
01x18,Okay.,Ted
01x18,Okay... bye.,Robin
01x18,Bye.,Ted
01x18,This is fine. This is totally fine.,Ted
01x18,What's fine?,Cab driver
01x18,"Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.",Ted
01x18,Nice.,Cab driver
01x18,"No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?",Ted
01x18,"You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip?",Cab driver
01x18,You can just let me out right up here.,Ted
01x18,"Where you going to, buddy?",Cab driver
01x18,"Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...",Ted
01x18,"And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?",Victoria
01x18,"Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.",Ted
01x18,Right. You're going to go make some juice.,Victoria
01x18,"Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.",Ted
01x18,"Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?",Victoria
01x18,"I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.",Ted
01x18,"Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head.",Victoria
01x18,Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.,Ted
01x18,Right.,Victoria
01x18,"Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.",Ted
01x18,"Hey, did she call?",Marshall
01x18,"No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.",Ted
01x18,"Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?",Marshall
01x18,"Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?",Barney
01x18,What?,Marshall  Lily
01x18,"Yeah, she told me already. Go on.",Barney
01x18,Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?,Marshall
01x18,"Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.",Barney
01x18,"Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.",Marshall
01x18,That is a lie!,Barney
01x18,It is not a lie.,Marshall
01x18,"Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!",Barney
01x18,I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army!,Marshall
01x18,"Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!",Ted
01x18,Cupcake?,Victoria
01x18,"No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?",Ted
01x18,"Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.",Victoria
01x18,Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.,Ted
01x18,"Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.",Marshall
01x18,"Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.",Ted
01x18,"Ted, what does your mom always say?",Marshall
01x18,Nothing good ever...,Ted
01x18,Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.,Marshall
01x18,"Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.",Ted
01x18,"Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.",Lily
01x18,What?,Ted
01x18,"It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.",Lily
01x18,She-she likes me?,Ted
01x18,"Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.",Lily
01x18,She likes me?,Ted
01x18,"Go home, Ted.",Lily
01x18,"Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.",Ted
01x18,Good. He's going home.,Lily
01x18,He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.,Marshall
01x18,What do you mean?,Lily
01x18,"Lily, here's what you just said: Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sx with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice.",Marshall
01x18,"No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.",Lily
01x18,I did have more sense than that.,Ted from 2030
01x18,Keep the change.,Ted
01x18,Thanks.,Cab driver
01x18,"But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep.",Ted from 2030
01x18,So you're doing this? You're going up there?,Victoria
01x18,You want to get out of the way?,Ted
01x18,I'm not in the way.,Victoria
01x18,"You know, if you had just called me, I...",Ted
01x18,Hi.,Robin
01x18,"Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.",Ted
01x18,Or we could just drink wine.,Robin
01x18,"Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.",Ted
01x18,Thanks.,Robin
01x18,Make it a big glass.,Ted
01x18,Sure.,Robin
01x18,"So, how's it hanging?",Ted
01x18,Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?,Robin
01x18,"Uh, about once a week.",Ted
01x18,"I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?",Robin
01x18,"When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.",Ted from 2030
01x18,We broke up.,Ted
01x18,What?,Robin
01x18,"Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.",Ted
01x18,"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.",Robin
01x18,You're smiling.,Ted
01x18,"Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.",Robin
01x18,Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.,Ted
01x18,How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.,Marshall
01x18,"Okay, it's time for bed.",Lily
01x18,What? No. It's 2:30.,Barney
01x18,Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.,Lily
01x18,"You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.",Barney
01x18,You never had a four-way.,Marshall
01x18,"I said almost. All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.",Barney
01x18,We're going home.,Lily
01x18,"What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",Barney
01x18,Rock 'n' roll.,Korean Elvis
01x18,And it begins.,Barney
01x18,"So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",Ted
01x18,"Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",Robin
01x18,"Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",Ted
01x18,Wow. Weird.,Robin
01x18,"Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",Ted
01x18,I'll be here.,Robin
01x18,Hello?,Ted
01x18,"Ted, this is your main man, K.E. I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?",Korean Elvis
01x18,Sorry about that.,Marshall
01x18,Was that Korean Elvis?,Ted
01x18,"I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",Marshall
01x18,"Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",Ted
01x18,"Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",Marshall
01x18,"What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",Ted
01x18,Gonna?,Lily
01x18,Yes. First thing tomorrow.,Ted
01x18,"Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.",Lily
01x18,I hate how you're always right.,Ted
01x18,It's my best and most annoying trait.,Lily
01x18,Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,Ted
01x18,Hey.,Robin
01x18,I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,Ted
01x18,"Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",Robin
01x18,Can I call you tomorrow?,Ted
01x18,Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,Robin
01x18,"Okay. Good night, Robin.",Ted
01x18,"Good night, Ted.",Robin
01x18,"Oh, my God. We're making out.",Robin
01x18,Right.,Ted
01x18,This is crazy.,Robin
01x18,Right? Right?,Ted
01x18,"Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",Robin
01x18,Yeah.,Ted
01x18,Yeah?,Robin
01x18,"Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",Ted
01x18,Okay.,Robin
01x18,Stop doing that.,Ted
01x18,Whatcha doin'?,Victoria
01x18,"I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",Ted
01x18,"Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...",Victoria
01x18,What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,Ted
01x18,Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.,Victoria
01x18,It's not ideal.,Ted
01x18,"Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.",Ted from 2030
01x18,"Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",Barney
01x18,I think he just spat on me.,Lily
01x18,"Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",Marshall
01x18,"No! No, come on.",Barney
01x18,Yes!,Marshall
01x18,"Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the le. We still got the gen. The da. The ry.",Barney
01x18,"Okay, if we're at the le, then I say we follow it up with a t's go home.",Lily
01x18,"Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.",Marshall
01x18,"No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh?",Korean Elvis
01x18,"Okay, seriously.",Lily
01x18,"Hey, I know what you like.",Korean Elvis
01x18,"And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.",Ted from 2030
01x18,"Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",Marshall
01x18,You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,Ted
01x18,Good. So you're gonna go home?,Victoria
01x18,"Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",Ted
01x18,Ted.,Victoria
01x18,"It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gn by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",Ted
01x18,"Oh, please. You just want to get laid.",Victoria
01x18,"Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",Ted
01x18,That's not your phone.,Victoria
01x18,This isn't my phone.,Ted
01x18,"Okay. Bye.  I thought it was mine, so I answered it.",Robin
01x18,Was it...?,Ted
01x18,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
01x18,"I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up. Yes... And there you have it, kids. The stupidest thing I've ever done. In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this: when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep.",Ted from 2030
01x19,"Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.",Ted
01x19,What do you mean could?,Lily
01x19,"I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",Ted
01x19,"Trust that impulse, Ted.",Barney
01x19,"Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",Robin
01x19,A... LAME-A?,Lily
01x19,"We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",Robin
01x19,Yes! Word up!,All
01x19,"Yeah, put me down for two.",Ted
01x19,Really? It's three months away.,Robin
01x19,"I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",Ted
01x19,I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,Ted
01x19,You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,Barney
01x19,"Yes, that's what I meant by you know. I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",Ted
01x19,"You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",Marshall
01x19,"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",Barney
01x19,That's only two.,Ted
01x19,Count again.,Barney
01x19,"Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",Ted
01x19,So get an escort.,Barney
01x19,"By escort, you mean prostitute?",Ted
01x19,Why not?,Barney
01x19,Because... gross?,Ted
01x19,"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",Barney
01x19,You really think that's true?,Marshall
01x19,"Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",Barney
01x19,"Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",Marshall
01x19,"Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",Barney
01x19,"Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sx with?",Ted
01x19,Yes.,Barney
01x19,No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,Ted
01x19,"That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",Barney
01x19,You just made that up.,Marshall
01x19,Withdrawn.,Barney
01x19,"Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",Marshall
01x19,57 days.,Ted
01x19,Is that your water? May I?,Barney
01x19,"Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
01x19,"Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",Barney
01x19,"No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",Ted
01x19,"Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",Barney
01x19,"Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",Ted
01x19,You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.,Barney
01x19,"You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",Ted
01x19,I said good day!,Barney
01x19,So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,Robin
01x19,What?,Lily
01x19,You okay?,Robin
01x19,"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",Lily
01x19,"Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",Robin
01x19,"Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",Lily
01x19,"Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",Robin
01x19,Yep.,Lily
01x19,"Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",Robin
01x19,"Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",Lily
01x19,"No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",Robin
01x19,"No, it's not going to be weird at all.  Robin's bringing a date.",Lily
01x19,Boy. That's going to be really weird.,Marshall
01x19,I know.,Lily
01x19,Robin's bringing a date.,Marshall
01x19,Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,Ted
01x19,"Dude, it's going to be weird.",Marshall
01x19,"No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",Ted
01x19,"Yeah, it won't be weird.",Barney
01x19,Thank you.,Ted
01x19,Because you're going to bring your own date.,Barney
01x19,"Hello, Barney.",Woman
01x19,"Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",Barney
01x19,Nice to meet you Ted.,Mary
01x19,"Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",Ted
01x19,So we're going to an award show?,Mary
01x19,"Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",Ted
01x19,"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",Barney
01x19,What the hell?,Ted
01x19,"Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",Barney
01x19,You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!,Ted
01x19,"Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have sx with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: B all night long.",Barney
01x19,I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.,Ted
01x19,"The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.",Barney
01x19,500 bucks?,Ted
01x19,"Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless trnny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.",Barney
01x19,"I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.",Ted
01x19,And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.,Ted from 2030
01x19,Check out Robin's date.,Marshall
01x19,I know.,Ted
01x19,Is that who I think it is?,Marshall
01x19,Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.,Ted
01x19,"Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One, the most low-budget cable news network ever.",Ted from 2030
01x19,Sandy time. Sandy time!,Ted
01x19,"He was best known for his morning segment In Today's Paper, during which he literally flipped through today's papers, reading them aloud to viewers.",Ted from 2030
01x19,"Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting.",Sandy
01x19,These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.,Ted from 2030
01x19,"Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, prn star Sandy...?",Ted
01x19,"Yosemite Sandy, definitely.",Marshall
01x19,Excellent choice. I love this guy.,Ted
01x19,I hate this guy.,Ted
01x19,Hey.,Lily
01x19,Hi.,Mary
01x19,I'm Lily.,Lily
01x19,Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.,Mary
01x19,"Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer.",Marshall
01x19,Hey.,Ted
01x19,Hi.,Robin
01x19,You look nice.,Ted
01x19,"Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.",Robin
01x19,Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.,Sandy
01x19,"Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...",Ted
01x19,Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way.,Sandy
01x19,"Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.",Ted
01x19,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards. Please say hello to our host for the evening, king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie, Vampire Lou!",Voice
01x19,Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting and the triumph of the human spirit.,Vampire Lou
01x19,"Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.",Marshall
01x19,I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.,Ted
01x19,"Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.",Marshall
01x19,"Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sx for money.",Barney
01x19,Who has sx for money?,Lily
01x19,Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?,Marshall
01x19,"No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.",Lily
01x19,"Lily, you okay?",Ted
01x19,"Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.",Lily
01x19,Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.,Sandy
01x19,Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.,Lily
01x19,Wow. Why are you so tired?,Mary
01x19,"Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.",Lily
01x19,"Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.",Barney
01x19,"Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.",Lily
01x19,"Well, it's just an internship, for the record.",Marshall
01x19,"Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?",Lily
01x19,A prostitute.,Mary
01x19,"Exactly. Thank you, Mary.",Lily
01x19,"So, Mary, what do you do for a living?",Robin
01x19,She's a paralegal.,Barney
01x19,"Yes, I'm a paralegal.",Mary
01x19,"Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?",Robin
01x19,I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.,Mary
01x19,"Oh, what firm?",Lily
01x19,"Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.",Mary
01x19,That's a real law firm.,Marshall
01x19,I know.,Mary
01x19,Nice.,Marshall
01x19,You're pretty good on your feet.,Ted
01x19,Are you flirting with me?,Mary
01x19,Is that allowed?,Ted
01x19,"Yes, it's encouraged.",Mary
01x19,"You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!",Ted
01x19,"Well, thank you.",Mary
01x19,You're welcome.,Ted
01x19,"Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.",Robin
01x19,"So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.",Ted
01x19,"You got me. What do you do, Ted?",Sandy
01x19,"Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.",Ted
01x19,Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.,Sandy
01x19,"Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?",Mary
01x19,"You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.",Ted
01x19,"And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.",Ted from 2030
01x19,Hey.,Ted
01x19,"Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?",Robin
01x19,"I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.",Ted
01x19,"And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.",Robin
01x19,"So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?",Ted
01x19,We're still friends.,Robin
01x19,"Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?",Ted
01x19,"Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?",Robin
01x19,"Oh, so now she's a whore?",Ted
01x19,What?,Robin
01x19,"You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.",Ted
01x19,I like that guy.,Sandy
01x19,Hey.,Ted
01x19,Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?,Sandy
01x19,"Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.",Ted
01x19,"Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.",Sandy
01x19,"Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.",Ted
01x19,Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.,Mary
01x19,"Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",Barney
01x19,Sleep with a prostitute?,Ted
01x19,"No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75 more likely to have success in future relationships.",Barney
01x19,You just made that up.,Marshall
01x19,Withdrawn.,Barney
01x19,"Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.",Marshall
01x19,I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.,Ted
01x19,"Yeah, well... there we go.",Marshall
01x19,"Scooter Bam-Bam Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky.",Vampire Lou
01x19,"Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.",Robin
01x19,Congratulations.,Marshall
01x19,"Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?",Robin
01x19,Sure. Let's go.,Sandy
01x19,"Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.",Ted
01x19,"Dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
01x19,What's it look like?,Ted
01x19,"It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.",Marshall
01x19,"Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.",Ted
01x19,"Oh, that's real mature.",Marshall
01x19,"Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?",Lily
01x19,"Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.",Marshall
01x19,Should we go?,Mary
01x19,Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.,Ted
01x19,Good night.,Robin
01x19,"So, did you and Barney ever...?",Ted
01x19,There's not enough money in the world.,Mary
01x19,"Oh, thank God.",Ted
01x19,"Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?",Marshall
01x19,I put him in a cab.,Robin
01x19,So you and he aren't...?,Barney
01x19,I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?,Robin
01x19,He's off trying to make you jealous.,Marshall
01x19,"Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.",Robin
01x19,"Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.",Marshall
01x19,Mary's a prostitute?,"Lily, waking up"
01x19,What?!,Robin
01x19,Barney paid for her.,Marshall
01x19,Is that true?,Lily
01x19,"We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.",Marshall
01x19,"Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?",Robin
01x19,"You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",Lily
01x19,That's her napkin.,Marshall
01x19,No!,Lily
01x19,"Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",Barney
01x19,Mary's not really a prostitute.,Vampire Lou
01x19,What?,Marshall
01x19,"That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",Barney
01x19,So she's not...?,Marshall
01x19,"No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Barney
01x19,I feel kind of like Richard Gere.,Ted
01x19,"Not shy about your looks, are you?",Mary
01x19,"No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.",Ted
01x19,Done what?,Mary
01x19,"You know, been... on a date.",Ted
01x19,"Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right?",Mary
01x19,"No. Why, is that so odd?",Ted
01x19,"Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.",Mary
01x19,"God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...",Ted
01x19,"Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.",Mary
01x19,Must be tough.,Ted
01x19,"Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about al. Well, here we are.",Mary
01x19,"Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.",Ted
01x19,What?,Mary
01x19,"Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have sx with a prostitute.",Ted
01x19,"No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.",Mary
01x19,"Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.",Ted
01x19,"No, Ted... I'm a paralegal.",Mary
01x19,"No, you're a hooker.",Ted
01x19,"No, I'm a paralegal.",Mary
01x19,You're a paralegal.,Ted
01x19,That was not funny.,Ted
01x19,"Not funny, dude.",Marshall
01x19,"I know, it was hilarious.",Barney
01x19,Why would you do that?,Ted
01x19,I did it to prove a point.,Barney
01x19,What point?,Ted
01x19,"Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",Barney
01x19,"So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",Ted
01x19,"Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.",Barney
01x19,She slapped me and stormed off.,Ted
01x19,Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,Barney
01x19,"I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.",Marshall
01x19,"Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.",Ted
01x19,Your room?,Barney
01x19,"Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.",Ted
01x19,"Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Marshall
01x20,"Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement, there occurred a game-changing emergency.",Ted from 2030
01x20,Van Smoot is available.,Marshall
01x20,"Oh, my God!",Lily
01x20,"Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River. It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding, but it was never available. And then, suddenly, it was.",Ted from 2030
01x20,There was a cancellation two months from now.,Marshall
01x20,You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.,Lily
01x20,"It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!",Marshall
01x20,"No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.",Lily
01x20,"Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.",Marshall
01x20,Todd and Valerie?,Lily
01x20,"When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple.",Ted from 2030
01x20,We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!,Marshall
01x20,"Oh! Kids, color! Come on, baby.",Lily
01x20,"Come on, come on, come on.",Marshall
01x20,"Hello, Marshall. Lily.",Todd
01x20,Todd. Valerie. Stairs.,Marshall
01x20,I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.,Lily
01x20,It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.,Marshall
01x20,What?,Robin
01x20,You're a wonder.,Marshall
01x20,Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,Ted
01x20,How are you going to get everything done?,Robin
01x20,"Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",Lily
01x20,Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.,Ted from 2030
01x20,Was it...?,Ted
01x20,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
01x20,"Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",Lily
01x20,"Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",Marshall
01x20,"Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",Barney
01x20,"Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",Lily
01x20,"Lil, you know I can't promise that.",Barney
01x20,"Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",Marshall
01x20,Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,Lily
01x20,"Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",Marshall
01x20,Who?,Lily
01x20,The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.,Marshall
01x20,"I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.",Ted
01x20,John Bonzo Bonham from Led Zeppelin?,Lily
01x20,"Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.",Ted
01x20,"Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",Lily
01x20,"Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",Marshall
01x20,"Well, then... I have to say no.",Lily
01x20,"Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",Marshall
01x20,"Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?",Lily
01x20,Let me check their Website.,Marshall
01x20,What?,Lily
01x20,"Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.",Ted
01x20,"Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?",Lily
01x20,Wow.,Ted
01x20,Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.,Barney
01x20,We already have a caterer.,Lily
01x20,"Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...",Barney
01x20,It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.,Marshall
01x20,A prom? Can... can we go to that?,Lily
01x20,"Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.",Marshall
01x20,"Yeah. No, they won't.",Lily
01x20,Why not?,Marshall
01x20,'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.,Lily
01x20,"No sweat, we'll just sneak in.",Barney
01x20,We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.,Marshall
01x20,"Yes, we are. It's the only way.",Lily
01x20,"You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",Ted
01x20,"It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",Lily
01x20,Well...,Barney
01x20,"No, Barney.",Lily
01x20,"And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.",Ted from 2030
01x20,I'll go with you.,Robin
01x20,Really?,Lily
01x20,Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.,Robin
01x20,Lesbian.,Barney
01x20,The cough is supposed to cover the lesbian.,Robin
01x20,"No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.",Barney
01x20,Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,Lily
01x20,"Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got statutory written all over your body.",Barney
01x20,"Hey, why don't we all go?",Ted
01x20,I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,Robin
01x20,"Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",Ted
01x20,Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,Marshall
01x20,Yeah.,Ted
01x20,"'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.",Marshall
01x20,"Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.",Barney
01x20,"All right, what do you think?",Lily
01x20,Horrible.,Barney
01x20,You're gonna make such a great dad.,Lily
01x20,"You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",Barney
01x20,"Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",Lily
01x20,"Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",Robin
01x20,All right.,Lily
01x20,"That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",Barney
01x20,"I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",Robin
01x20,I didn't know I still had this.,Lily
01x20,What?,Robin
01x20,The dress I wore to my actual prom.,Lily
01x20,"Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.",Scooter
01x20,"Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",Lily
01x20,So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in!,Scooter
01x20,"Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",Lily
01x20,"You mean happy for us, right, babe?",Scooter
01x20,"Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",Lily
01x20,"No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.",Scooter
01x20,"Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",Barney
01x20,"No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",Robin
01x20,Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,Barney
01x20,Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,Lily
01x20,"Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",Barney
01x20,"No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",Robin
01x20,We got to go. See ya.,Lily
01x20,"Bye, have fun. See you.",Ted
01x20,"They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?",Marshall
01x20,"So, what, we ready for tonight?",Ted
01x20,Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,Marshall
01x20,Shot of Jim Beam?,Ted
01x20,Yeah.,Marshall
01x20,Yes!,Ted
01x20,And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,Marshall
01x20,What?!,Ted
01x20,"I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",Marshall
01x20,"Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",Ted
01x20,"Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",Marshall
01x20,"Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",Ted
01x20,"Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",Lily
01x20,Is this gonna work?,Robin
01x20,"Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",Lily
01x20,"Uh, you're adults.",Security guard
01x20,"Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",Lily
01x20,And you're just finding a band?,Security guard
01x20,"Hey, ho, hey!",Barney
01x20,"I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.",Security guard
01x20,Wow. Ma'am? Check and mate.,Lily
01x20,"It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",Barney
01x20,"Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",Robin
01x20,We don't have that kind of money.,Boy
01x20,For free.,Robin
01x20,"Oh, hell yeah!",Boy
01x20,"Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",Robin
01x20,Hi. Shall we?,Lily
01x20,Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.,Boy
01x20,"Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",Robin
01x20,Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,Barney
01x20,We're in!,Lily
01x20,Thank you. We're going to take a break.,Singer
01x20,"Oh, you're kidding me.",Lily
01x20,"Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?",Boy  1
01x20,"Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",Robin
01x20,"Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them.",Boy  1
01x20,"Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",Robin
01x20,"Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play Good Feeling by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fianc wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play Good Feeling because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",Lily
01x20,"Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.",Man
01x20,"So, you buzzing, baby?",Boy  1
01x20,My phlegm feels looser.,Robin
01x20,"This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",Ted
01x20,You know it.,Marshall
01x20,"I'd have your back, too.",Ted
01x20,That's cool.,Marshall
01x20,"What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",Ted
01x20,"Okay, Ted.  Hello.",Marshall
01x20,"Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for Good Feeling and bring it out here, like, now.",Robin
01x20,Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,Marshall
01x20,Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,Ted
01x20,"Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",Robin
01x20,What'd she say? What'd she say?,Ted
01x20,"He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",Robin
01x20,"Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",Marshall
01x20,"All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",Robin
01x20,There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,Lily
01x20,How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.,Scooter
01x20,I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,Lily
01x20,"What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!",Scooter
01x20,"Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",Lily
01x20,"You're, you're breaking up with me?",Scooter
01x20,"There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",Lily
01x20,"I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby.",Scooter
01x20,Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,Lily
01x20,"It's just one dance, God!",Boy  2
01x20,What?,Lily
01x20,"Well, we did promise them one dance.",Robin
01x20,"Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",Lily
01x20,"Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.",Andrew
01x20,"No, you won't.",Lily
01x20,I won't?,Andrew
01x20,"No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?",Lily
01x20,Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend?,Andrew
01x20,"So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?",Boy  1
01x20,"Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",Robin
01x20,"Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.",Giant Turtle
01x20,Okay.,Ted
01x20,How'd you get in here?,Giant Turtle
01x20,"What's it to you, giant turtle?",Marshall
01x20,"It's me, Barney.",Giant Turtle
01x20,"Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",Marshall
01x20,She's in the bathroom.,Barney
01x20,"Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",Marshall
01x20,All right.,Ted
01x20,How did you guys get in here?,Barney
01x20,We just snuck in the back.,Ted
01x20,You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,Barney
01x20,But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,Ted
01x20,"Hey, bro, have you seen my fiance Lily?",Marshall
01x20,"Your fiance? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble.",Andrew
01x20,"Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",Marshall
01x20,"No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.",Andrew
01x20,"Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",Marshall
01x20,Yah! Nunchaku!,Andrew
01x20,I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,Lily
01x20,"I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",Robin
01x20,Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,Lily
01x20,"I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafs for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",Lily
01x20,Marshall.,Man
01x20,"Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",Lily
01x20,Yeah.,Marshall
01x20,It works.,Lily
01x20,Violent Femmes. I love this song.,Marshall
01x20,"Me, too.",Lily
01x20,"I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",Lily
01x20,"Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",Robin
01x20,Yeah.,Lily
01x20,"And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",Robin
01x20,"Yeah. So field hockey, huh?",Lily
01x20,Shut up.,Robin
01x20,"Trespassing, assaulting a minor. This mascot costume you stole cost 5,000.",Security guard  1
01x20,"We can have you guys arrested, you know that?",Security guard  2
01x20,"Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",Ted
01x20,I totally could have taken that kid.,Marshall
01x20,"Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",Ted
01x20,"Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",Marshall
01x20,"Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",Ted
01x20,"No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",Marshall
01x20,Absolutely not.,Security guards
01x20,"You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?",Barney
01x20,Hey!,Security guard  1
01x20,"You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.",Ted
01x20,This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.,Singer
01x20,So how was your first prom?,Ted
01x20,"You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",Robin
01x20,"So, basically, it was a prom.",Ted
01x20,"Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",Robin
01x20,I'll take what I can get.,Ted
01x20,"And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",Barney
01x20,"So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",Marshall
01x20,"Yeah, it's good.",Lily
01x20,"Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.",Marshall
01x20,Two months.,Lily
01x21,"Kids, life is a dark road. You never really know what's up ahead. One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"And for the birthday boy, lasagna.",Waitress
01x21,Thank you.,Ted
01x21,Careful. The plate is very hot.,Waitress
01x21,"'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.",Ted
01x21,"Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
01x21,"All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?",Ted
01x21,"Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.",Robin
01x21,"I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.",Barney
01x21,"You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.",Marshall
01x21,"Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.",Ted
01x21,"Oy, gevalt.",Marshall
01x21,"Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.",Barney
01x21,Whoo-hoo!,Ted
01x21,"Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.",Barney
01x21,What?,Woman
01x21,Oh! Call an ambulance!,Barney
01x21,What's going on?,Woman
01x21,"Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.",Barney
01x21,Is she okay?,Waitress
01x21,"I'm serious, call 911.",Barney
01x21,What's wrong? What's the matter?,Woman
01x21,"Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!",Barney
01x21,"You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.",Robin
01x21,Wait for it.,Ted
01x21,"28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.",Lily
01x21,"Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad. Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story. But I'll get to that later.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?",Lily
01x21,Nope. I hit the snooze button.,Ted
01x21,And here come the paramedics.,Robin
01x21,"Oh, thank God, you're here.",Barney
01x21,What is going on?!,Paramedic
01x21,I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.,Barney
01x21,What are you talking about?,Woman
01x21,You've had a terrible fall.,Barney
01x21,"No, I haven't.",Woman
01x21,Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?,Barney
01x21,Give him your number.,All
01x21,"Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.",Barney
01x21,Give him your number.,All
01x21,What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.,Barney
01x21,All right!,Woman
01x21,It works!,Barney
01x21,I cannot believe that she gave him her number.,Marshall
01x21,Maybe she really does have a brain injury.,Robin
01x21,"Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.",Barney
01x21,"I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",Ted
01x21,"Well, what's perfect?",Lily
01x21,It's not like I have a list.,Ted
01x21,"Oh, yes, you do.",Robin
01x21,"Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",Ted
01x21,That's not hard. I know at least...,Lily
01x21,"I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",Ted
01x21,Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,Marshall
01x21,"Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",Ted
01x21,You're never going to find this girl.,Lily
01x21,Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,Ted
01x21,"So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",Marshall
01x21,That's the plan.,Ted
01x21,"And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"Whoa, you're up early.",Ted
01x21,"Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",Lily
01x21,Does Marshall know?,Ted
01x21,He's still sound asleep.,Lily
01x21,"Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",Marshall
01x21,"Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
01x21,"Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",Marshall
01x21,"God, why didn't you throw it away?",Ted
01x21,I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,Lily
01x21,Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,Marshall
01x21,"What's wrong, baby?",Lily
01x21,This is the high point of my day.,Marshall
01x21,"It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",Marshall
01x21,Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,Barney
01x21,"I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",Marshall
01x21,"Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",Barney
01x21,So?,Marshall
01x21,"So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",Barney
01x21,Oh! Sweet Lord.,Marshall
01x21,And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,Barney
01x21,Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,Marshall
01x21,Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.,Barney
01x21,You?,Marshall
01x21,"Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",Barney
01x21,What?,Marshall
01x21,"Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is wr, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",Barney
01x21,This is stupid.,Marshall
01x21,"Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",Barney
01x21,"This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",Marshall
01x21,"Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",Barney
01x21,"Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...",Tracy
01x21,"I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",Marshall
01x21,Hello?,Ted
01x21,Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?,Man
01x21,Speaking.,Ted
01x21,"Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.",Man
01x21,"Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",Ted
01x21,"Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate.",Bob
01x21,I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,Ted
01x21,"Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.",Bob
01x21,So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,Ted
01x21,There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.,Bob
01x21,"No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",Ted
01x21,She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.,Bob
01x21,"So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"All right, fine. Set it up.",Ted
01x21,"You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",Marshall
01x21,Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,Barney
01x21,Tastes normal to me.,Marshall
01x21,"That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",Barney
01x21,"Oh, God!",Marshall
01x21,It got me as well.,Barney
01x21,"Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",Marshall
01x21,Because now... you're in.,Barney
01x21,Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that bstrd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,Marshall
01x21,"Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",Barney
01x21,"So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started...",Ted from 2030
01x21,Lily?,Ted
01x21,"Hey, Ted, are you busy?",Lily
01x21,Um... yes.,Ted
01x21,"Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",Lily
01x21,What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,Ted
01x21,"Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",Lily
01x21,"I can't, I'm waiting...",Ted
01x21,"Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",Lily
01x21,"Come on, Lily.",Ted
01x21,But you see my point.,Lily
01x21,"All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",Ted
01x21,"And so, one 90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",Lily
01x21,Yes.,Ted
01x21,And was she okay about pushing it back?,Lily
01x21,Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,Ted
01x21,You can never tell Marshall.,Lily
01x21,I won't.,Ted
01x21,Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,Lily
01x21,I swear on Luke and Leia.,Ted
01x21,"About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",Lily
01x21,Did you talk to Marshall about it?,Ted
01x21,"He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",Lily
01x21,That was you? Awesome!,Ted
01x21,"I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",Lily
01x21,Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,Ted
01x21,"San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",Lily
01x21,You don't want to get married.,Ted
01x21,Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,Lily
01x21,"Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",Ted
01x21,"Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",Lily
01x21,I don't think you're stupid.,Ted
01x21,I love Marshall.,Lily
01x21,I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,Ted
01x21,But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,Lily
01x21,So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,Marshall
01x21,All done.,Ted
01x21,"Ted, let's go to New Haven.",Lily
01x21,"Lily, don't do this to yourself.",Ted
01x21,"I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",Lily
01x21,"No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",Ted
01x21,"Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, Yep. That was a mistake. So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",Lily
01x21,"I don't know. You said mistake a lot. Lily, don't do this.",Ted
01x21,"Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",Lily
01x21,"Forgive you for what?  Hey, I need a big favor.",Ted
01x21,"Anything, bro.",Barney
01x21,I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,Ted
01x21,No.,Barney
01x21,It's kind of an emergency.,Ted
01x21,What are you doing in Duchess County?,Barney
01x21,Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,Ted
01x21,"I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",Barney
01x21,Is that Ted?,Marshall
01x21,Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,Barney
01x21,Don't you have a big date tonight?,Marshall
01x21,"Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",Ted
01x21,So what are you doing in Duchess County?,Marshall
01x21,Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,Ted
01x21,"Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",Marshall
01x21,No!,Ted
01x21,"Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",Marshall
01x21,"No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",Ted
01x21,So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,Marshall
01x21,Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,Ted
01x21,"Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",Barney
01x21,"You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",Marshall
01x21,You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,Barney
01x21,"Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",Marshall
01x21,Taking off for the night.,Tracy
01x21,"Thanks, Tracy.",Barney
01x21,Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?,Tracy
01x21,Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,Barney
01x21,No.,Marshall
01x21,That would have been bad.,Barney
01x21,Horrible.,Marshall
01x21,"Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"Need a ride, cowboy?",Robin
01x21,Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,Ted
01x21,"Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",Robin
01x21,Candy?!,Ted
01x21,So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,Robin
01x21,Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,Ted
01x21,"Oh, come on.",Robin
01x21,I like your hat.,Ted
01x21,Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,Robin
01x21,"Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",Ted
01x21,"Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took highlights to mean, I want to look like a tiger, hence the hat.",Robin
01x21,Oh. I gotta see this.,Ted
01x21,No way.,Robin
01x21,Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,Ted
01x21,"So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",Robin
01x21,"Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",Ted
01x21,"Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",Robin
01x21,"Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",Ted
01x21,I read that. More like Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.,Robin
01x21,"You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",Ted
01x21,We're not indoors. We're in a van.,Robin
01x21,Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,Ted
01x21,Never. What else?,Robin
01x21,She loves lasagna.,Ted
01x21,Barf.,Robin
01x21,"You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",Ted
01x21,What else?,Robin
01x21,"Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",Ted
01x21,And she's looking to get married and have kids?,Robin
01x21,Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,Ted
01x21,"Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",Robin
01x21,Really? You don't want kids?,Ted
01x21,"You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.",Robin
01x21,"Hey, thanks for picking me up.",Ted
01x21,Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,Robin
01x21,Thanks.,Ted
01x21,"All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",Robin
01x21,You're going to show me your hair?,Ted
01x21,"Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",Robin
01x21,You just made my night.,Ted
01x21,Go.,Robin
01x21,"Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",Marshall
01x21,"Hey, guys.",Ted
01x21,Hi.,Lily
01x21,"Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",Ted
01x21,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",Lily
01x21,You think you might want to... drink the milk?,Ted
01x21,"No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",Lily
01x21,"Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",Marshall
01x21,I didn't go.,Ted
01x21,What? Why?,Marshall
01x21,I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,Ted
01x21,Why? She sounds perfect.,Marshall
01x21,I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,Ted
01x21,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",Marshall
01x21,Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,Ted
01x21,Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,Marshall
01x21,"Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.",Ted from 2030
01x21,"Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
01x21,"Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
01x21,Even really really dumb mistakes.,Ted from 2030
01x22,It was May of 2006 in New York City and life was good. But everything was about to change.,Ted from 2030
01x22,So... what do you think?,Ted
01x22,"Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",Barney
01x22,But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,Ted
01x22,Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,Marshall
01x22,"Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this.  Ow! What the hell?",Ted
01x22,That wasn't me. That was the universe.,Barney
01x22,"The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm.",Ted from 2030
01x22,"And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin?",Weather man
01x22,"Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",Robin
01x22,"Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.",Sandy
01x22,Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,Robin
01x22,"And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.",Sandy
01x22,Have a great night.,Robin
01x22,"And, we're clear.",Man
01x22,"Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sx with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.",Sandy
01x22,"Well, I'd give you the I don't date coworkers speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",Robin
01x22,"Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.",Sandy
01x22,"Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, enough?",Marshall
01x22,"One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",Ted
01x22,"So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",Lily
01x22,"I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",Ted
01x22,"I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...",Barney
01x22,"Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",Lily
01x22,Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,Ted
01x22,"Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",Marshall
01x22,She should be here any second.,Ted
01x22,"Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?",Musician
01x22,"Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",Ted
01x22,Damn it.,Robin
01x22,Hello.,Lily
01x22,"Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",Robin
01x22,Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,Lily
01x22,"Yes, I gave it to you.",Robin
01x22,"Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",Lily
01x22,"Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",Robin
01x22,"No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",Lily
01x22,"Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",Robin
01x22,"Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.",Voice mail
01x22,"Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",Lily
01x22,Summer fellowship?,Marshall
01x22,Just knock. Okay.,Robin
01x22,Hi.,Ted
01x22,Hi.,Robin
01x22,"Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",Ted
01x22,Yes. No. I don't know.,Robin
01x22,Those are the three options.,Ted
01x22,"Ted, this is so...",Robin
01x22,I know.,Ted
01x22,"I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",Robin
01x22,"Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",Ted
01x22,"Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.",Musician
01x22,"No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",Ted
01x22,Sure. We're not getting any pizza.,Musician
01x22,Okay. Let's talk.,Robin
01x22,"Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",Ted
01x22,"Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks.  You're crazy.",Robin
01x22,Right. Come on.,Ted
01x22,"It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",Robin
01x22,I know. But... come on...,Ted
01x22,"And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",Robin
01x22,"Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",Ted
01x22,"I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",Robin
01x22,I thought that thing was canceled.,Ted
01x22,"Well, it's back on.",Robin
01x22,Since when?,Ted
01x22,Since like an hour ago.,Robin
01x22,..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin?,Weather man
01x22,"Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York.",Sandy
01x22,And we're clear.,Man
01x22,You're leaving?,Robin
01x22,There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.,Sandy
01x22,"Oh, congratulations.",Robin
01x22,Congratulations yourself.,Sandy
01x22,What do you mean?,Robin
01x22,"Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.",Sandy
01x22,"Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",Robin
01x22,"Yes, what?",Sandy
01x22,"Yes, let's go get dinner.",Robin
01x22,How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.,Sandy
01x22,"Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",Ted
01x22,"Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",Robin
01x22,Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,Ted
01x22,I don't-I don't know.,Robin
01x22,"So, what? You actually like this guy now?",Ted
01x22,I don't know.,Robin
01x22,Are you gonna hook up with him?,Ted
01x22,I don't know.,Robin
01x22,"Yes, you do.",Ted
01x22,"No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",Robin
01x22,I don't plan out every...,Ted
01x22,"Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi? No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",Robin
01x22,"Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",Ted
01x22,I need to think about this.,Robin
01x22,Fine.,Ted
01x22,"No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",Robin
01x22,"If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",Ted
01x22,"Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",Robin
01x22,Then I guess it's not meant to be.,Ted
01x22,"Nice try, buddy.",Barney
01x22,Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,Marshall
01x22,Screw that. This ain't over.,Ted
01x22,"Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",Marshall
01x22,"I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",Ted
01x22,Unpause?,Lily
01x22,Unpause.,Marshall
01x22,"Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days.",Ted from 2030
01x22,A painting fellowship?,Marshall
01x22,I was never going to take it.,Lily
01x22,In California?,Marshall
01x22,I was never going to take it.,Lily
01x22,"Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",Barney
01x22,"Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",Ted
01x22,What are you talking about?,Barney
01x22,I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,Ted
01x22,"Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",Barney
01x22,"Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",Ted
01x22,Yeah.,Barney
01x22,Are you still in touch with her?,Ted
01x22,"Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sx, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",Barney
01x22,"Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",Ted
01x22,Did you just say a rain dance?,Barney
01x22,Yes.,Ted
01x22,A rain dance.,Barney
01x22,Yes.,Ted
01x22,A dance to make it rain.,Barney
01x22,Yes.  We're finding Penelope!,Ted
01x22,"No, we are not!",Barney
01x22,"Yes, we are!",Ted
01x22,"Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",Barney
01x22,Why the hell should I help you?,Penelope
01x22,"Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",Barney
01x22,"We had sx twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?",Penelope
01x22,Twice!,Barney
01x22,"Barney, there is no way...",Penelope
01x22,Shh!,Barney
01x22,"Seriously, come on.",Penelope
01x22,"Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",Ted
01x22,Why?,Penelope
01x22,There's this girl...,Ted
01x22,"There's this girl. You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.",Penelope
01x22,"Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",Ted
01x22,"This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?",Penelope
01x22,Absolutely.,Ted
01x22,Kind of like Barney?,Penelope
01x22,Kind of.,Ted
01x22,Hey.,Barney
01x22,You hit on my mom!,Penelope
01x22,We weren't exclusive!,Barney
01x22,I'm in.,Penelope
01x22,And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.,Ted from 2030
01x22,Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.,Penelope
01x22,"Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",Barney
01x22,I will throw you off this roof.,Penelope
01x22,There's so much of your mom in you.,Barney
01x22,And she's been throwing up ever since.,Robin
01x22,So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?,Veterinary
01x22,"Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",Robin
01x22,"Oh, that's so sweet.",Veterinary
01x22,"Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",Robin
01x22,Nobody does that.,Veterinary
01x22,Exactly.,Robin
01x22,"No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.",Veterinary
01x22,So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,Lily
01x22,"Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",Marshall
01x22,"Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",Lily
01x22,So now we've gone from I was never gonna do it to I need to do this? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?,Marshall
01x22,"Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",Lily
01x22,"I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",Marshall
01x22,Maybe not.,Lily
01x22,Pause.,Marshall
01x22,"So, are you just, like, starving?",Lily
01x22,Totally. Red Lobster?,Marshall
01x22,"Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",Lily
01x22,"Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",Marshall
01x22,"I wouldn't dare.  Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!",Lily
01x22,"Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy...",Waiters
01x22,"Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",Barney
01x22,"Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",Ted
01x22,I think so.,Penelope
01x22,"Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",Ted
01x22,I think so.,Penelope
01x22,"Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",Ted
01x22,No.,Penelope
01x22,No?,Ted
01x22,"I've read extensively on the subject: firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...",Penelope
01x22,Have you ever seen a rain dance?,Ted
01x22,I've seen a film strip.,Penelope
01x22,"Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",Ted
01x22,"What do you mean we, white man?",Penelope
01x22,"How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",Marshall
01x22,I think there's still one left.,Lily
01x22,Dibs.,Marshall
01x22,Unpause?,Lily
01x22,Unpause.,Marshall
01x22,Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,Lily
01x22,"I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",Marshall
01x22,Why not?,Lily
01x22,"Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",Marshall
01x22,Marshall...,Lily
01x22,"'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",Marshall
01x22,"Marshall, I love you.",Lily
01x22,Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,Marshall
01x22,Pause.,Lily
01x22,"No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!",Marshall
01x22,Pause!,Lily
01x22,"Why do you want me to pause?!  That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.",Marshall
01x22,Thank you.,Lily
01x22,"Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",Barney
01x22,A rain dance.,Ted
01x22,"Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",Barney
01x22,"Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",Ted
01x22,These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,Barney
01x22,Yeah. I know that.,Ted
01x22,"Well, then why are you doing this?",Barney
01x22,"Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",Ted
01x22,"Oh, come on!",Barney
01x22,Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.,Weather man
01x22,How about that? He did it.,Barney
01x22,"Robin! Hey, Robin!  Oh, thank God you're here!",Ted
01x22,My camping trip got rained out.,Robin
01x22,I know. I'm sorry.,Ted
01x22,It's not your fault.,Robin
01x22,"Yeah, it is. Come down here.",Ted
01x22,It's pouring. You come up.,Robin
01x22,"No, you have to come down here.",Ted
01x22,Why?,Robin
01x22,"Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",Ted
01x22,"I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",Robin
01x22,"I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",Ted
01x22,I was gonna...,Robin
01x22,I know.,Ted
01x22,"And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed.",Ted from 2030
02x01,"OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.",Ted
02x01,Can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year,Ted's daughter
02x01,"Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",Ted
02x01,Can I go to the bathroom?,Ted's son
02x01,"No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. .",Ted
02x01,So that's it? We're breaking up?,Marshall
02x01,"Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.",Lily
02x01,"For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",Marshall
02x01,I should call her.,Marshall
02x01,"No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",Ted
02x01,You're a good friend Ted.,Marshall
02x01,"Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",Robin
02x01,"You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",Ted
02x01,Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,Robin
02x01,"Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",Marshall
02x01,"I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.",Barney
02x01,Thanks.,Marshall
02x01,I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?,Barney
02x01,Sure.,Marshall
02x01,"For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting What's up New York? we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... . Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!",Barney
02x01,One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning .,Ted from 2030
02x01,Hey Marshall.,Ted
02x01,Hey Ted.,Marshall
02x01,Are you hungry?,Ted
02x01,"What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.",Marshall
02x01,"At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!",Ted
02x01,"Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.",Marshall
02x01,"Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?",Ted
02x01,Beer.,Marshall
02x01,"No, that's what you had for dinner.",Ted
02x01,Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover,Marshall
02x01,"So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiance. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.",Barney
02x01,You should write and illustrate children's books.,Ted
02x01,"You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",Barney
02x01,"It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.",Ted
02x01,"Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.",Robin
02x01,"Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...",Ted
02x01,What?,Robin
02x01,"God, your eyes are so blue.",Ted
02x01,Teddy bear...,Robin
02x01,"Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. .",Ted from 2030
02x01,"So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.",Marshall
02x01,That's my shampoo.,Robin
02x01,Oh. Sorry.,Marshall
02x01,I thought he's never go to sleep.,Robin
02x01,Uh-oh.,Ted
02x01,Already?,Robin
02x01,He's calling her. Dammit!,Ted
02x01,I don't hear anyth...Ted  Argh!,Robin
02x01,"Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.",Marshall
02x01,"Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!",Marshall
02x01,Does he know I'm in here?,Robin 
02x01,"Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...",Marshall
02x01,"This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...",Robin
02x01,Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!,Barney
02x01,They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.,Ted
02x01,He slept on our floor last night Ted.,Robin
02x01,He watched a scary movie.,Ted
02x01,It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.,Robin
02x01,Mmm. Sunshine.,Barney
02x01,"Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!",Man
02x01,"Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",Marshall
02x01,"Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.",Barney
02x01,There are a lot of them.,Marshall
02x01,"They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.",Barney
02x01,"Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!",Ted
02x01,"I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.",Marshall
02x01,"Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.",Man
02x01,"Oh, no.",Ted
02x01,"It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart!  You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!",Marshall
02x01,"We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.",Ted
02x01,"See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.",Robin
02x01,"So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat Hauml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up?",Barney
02x01,"Yeah, that's the stuff.",Robin
02x01,Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?,Marshall
02x01,"My Dad taught me to sht when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... gns are fun!",Robin
02x01,"Um, you know, Ted is kinda against gns.Robin : That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a gn, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try?",Marshall
02x01,"Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is...",Marshall
02x01,I should have mention the recoil.,Robin
02x01,"I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.",Ted
02x01,"Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.",Robin
02x01,"Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.",Ted
02x01,Oh! What do I win?,Robin
02x01,I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.,Ted
02x01,You are? That's so nice!,Robin
02x01,"My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.",Ted
02x01,"Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?",Robin
02x01,"Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.",Marshall
02x01,"Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?",Ted
02x01,It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.,Marshall
02x01,So?,Ted
02x01,I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.,Marshall
02x01,"No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.",Ted
02x01,"I know, but I just...",Marshall
02x01,"August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?",Marshall
02x01,"Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.",Lily
02x01,Only the best for my little Lily Pad.,George Clinton
02x01,"Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.",Lily
02x01,I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.,George Clinton
02x01,"Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.",Lily
02x01,I got you a gift.,George Clinton
02x01,"Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.",Lily
02x01,I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody.,George Clinton
02x01,"It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.",Lily
02x01,"I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.",George Clinton
02x01,That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.,Ted
02x01,"Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.",Robin
02x01,"Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.",Marshall
02x01,Those charges are from a month ago.,Barney
02x01,Exactly!,Ted
02x01,"For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... .",Barney
02x01,Why do you talk? Why do you talk?,Ted
02x01,"He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.",Barney
02x01,"There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York.  I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.",Marshall
02x01,This has been holding in together?,Robin 
02x01,"OK, you know what? I'm calling her.",Marshall
02x01,No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. . While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.,Ted
02x01,You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.,Barney
02x01,Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this.,Ted
02x01,"OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.",Barney
02x01,Marshall!,Robin
02x01,Marshall! Marshall!,Ted
02x01,"Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!",Marshall
02x01,Everything we've worked so hard for...!,Ted
02x01,"Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.",Marshall
02x01,Hang up now!,Ted
02x01,"Ted, I can't hang up now.",Marshall
02x01,Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!,Ted
02x01,Hello?!  A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.,Marshall
02x01,No!,Barney
02x01,"Dude, you can't...",Ted
02x01,I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.,Marshall
02x01,"Marshall, you can't do that!",Robin
02x01,Really? Why not?,Marshall
02x01,56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.,Ted from 2030
02x01,"Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",Ted
02x01,Bold. Bold to go for the car.,Barney
02x01,What?,Ted
02x01,I didn't say a thing.,Robin
02x01,You think I was too hard on him.,Ted
02x01,I didn't say a thing.,Robin
02x01,I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.,Ted
02x01,"Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.",Robin
02x01,"Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gn nut?",Ted
02x01,"No, I'm a gn enthusiast.",Robin
02x01,Do you know how many people are klled...,Ted
02x01,The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...,Robin
02x01,"Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.",Ted
02x01,A little.,Robin
02x01,"I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.",Ted
02x01,Barney.,Barney
02x01,"Uh, hey. Where are you guys?",Ted
02x01,We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.,Barney
02x01,Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?,Ted
02x01,"Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.",Barney
02x01,Already?,Stripper
02x01,What? What uh-oh?,Ted
02x01,He's gone.,Barney
02x01,You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.,Ted
02x01,"Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!",Barney
02x01,Barney! End of the phone call,Ted
02x01,Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?,Robin
02x01,A really nice one.,Ted
02x01,"Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!",Ted
02x01,Hey.,Marshall
02x01,What happened?,Ted
02x01,"Well, I went up to Lily's floor...",Marshall
02x01,"...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. .",Marshall
02x01,You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?,Ted
02x01,Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.,Marshall
02x01,What? Who was he?,Ted
02x01,"His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer...",Ted from 2030
02x01,"Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?",Lily
02x01,"Yes, I do. End of flashback",Waiter Joey Adalian
02x01,"So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?",Ted
02x01,Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.,Marshall
02x01,"You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.",Ted
02x01,Ted.,Marshall
02x01,Yeah.,Ted
02x01,I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.,Marshall
02x01,"What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.",Ted
02x01,"OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.",Marshall
02x01,Cheers.,Ted
02x01,"But it wasn't. 'cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning...","DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment.Ted from 2030"
02x01,Ted. Ted you should see this.,Robin
02x01,"Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?",Ted
02x01,It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.,Marshall
02x01,"It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and gns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.",Ted from 2030
02x02,"Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward.",Ted from 2030

02x02,I'll walk you out.,Ted
02x02,See ya.,Marshall

02x02,"Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?",Barney
02x02,Candy.,Marshall
02x02,Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?,Barney
02x02,Mounds.,Ted

02x02,Lily.,Robin

02x02,You went home with her!,Marshall
02x02,"Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...",Barney
02x02,"Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.",Marshall
02x02,Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!,Barney

02x02,"I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.",Lily
02x02,She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.,Ted
02x02,"Oh, the art program, best thing ever.",Lily
02x02,"Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. .",Man

02x02,You never chose sides. I respect that.,Robin
02x02,She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!,Ted
02x02,Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?,Marshall

02x02,Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.,Robin
02x02,Way to go.,Marshall
02x02,"OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.",Ted

02x02,"Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?",Ted
02x02,"No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.",Robin

02x02,"Wow. So, maybe I should call him?",Lily
02x02,"Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word maybe. Maybe cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost klled him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.",Ted
02x02,This guy like pennies!,Robin 
02x02,Hi Marshall.,Barney
02x02,"No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.",Marshall
02x02,"OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had sx with you.",Barney
02x02,"There is no would in sx. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.",Marshall
02x02,"You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.",Barney
02x02,That's not possible.,Marshall
02x02,"Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!",Barney
02x02,A twin isn't the same person.,Marshall
02x02,"Of course, it is. What do you think identical means? Ident- - same. -ical - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.",Barney
02x02,Fine.,Marshall

02x02,Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.,Barney
02x02,So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.,Ted from 2030

02x02,Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.,Marshall

02x02,It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.,Marshall
02x02,But they're twins.,Barney
02x02,You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.,Marshall

02x02,Ted's my best friend.,Marshall
02x02,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is.

02x02,"Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.",Lily
02x02,"Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.",Marshall
02x02,I know. It was the worst summer of my life.,Lily
02x02,It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.,Marshall
02x02,Can we please get back together?,Lily
02x02,"All that crap you said to me about we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.. It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.",Marshall
02x02,Can we please get back together?,Lily
02x02,"Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.",Marshall
02x02,Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?,Lily
02x02,Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.,Marshall
02x02,"Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. . And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.",Lily
02x02,Yeah.,Marshall
02x02,"Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.",Lily
02x02,"Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.",Marshall
02x02,"So then, I was promoted to assistant mnage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that?  Lily?",Barney
02x02,"You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk!",Lily
02x02,"So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant mnage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!",Barney
02x02,You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! .,Lily
02x02,"Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played.",Barney
02x03,"Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.",Ted
02x03,I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
02x03,I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
02x03,I hate you.,Lily
02x03,I hate you more.,Marshall
02x03,I'm going to kll him.,Ted
02x03,I can't say I blame you.,Barney
02x03,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to kll him.",Ted
02x03,I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
02x03,Not now.,Ted's mother
02x03,"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
02x03,Robin...!,Ted's mother
02x03,"Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.",Ted from 2030
02x03,"As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend.","The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030"
02x03,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.",Ted's mother
02x03,You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit coca1ne?,Ted
02x03,Coffee?,Ted's mother
02x03,"You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real.",Ted from 2030
02x03,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.",Lily
02x03,"Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.",Ted's father
02x03,Good to see you.,Marshall
02x03,I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.,Lily
02x03,"Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...",Ted's mother
02x03,Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?,Marshall
02x03,Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?,Lily
02x03,I love your hair.,Ted's mother
02x03,"This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.",Ted from 2030
02x03,"Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.",Marshall
02x03,"Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00. Lily, would you like to join us?",Ted's mother
02x03,Um...,Lily 
02x03,What?,Marshall
02x03,"Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.",Lily
02x03,Why would it?,Marshall
02x03,"Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.",Lily
02x03,"Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.",Marshall
02x03,"Brother and sister?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro.",Lily
02x03,See? Not awkward at all.,Ted from 2030
02x03,"Hello, everyone.",Lily
02x03,Hi.,All
02x03,"Hello, Marshall.",Lily
02x03,"Lily, that is a stunning dress.",Ted's mother
02x03,"Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, Hey, we're all family. Right, bro? Ooh, ah...",Lily
02x03,What's wrong?,Ted
02x03,"Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just...  Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.",Lily
02x03,"No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.",Marshall
02x03,"Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.",Marshall
02x03,"Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.",Barney
02x03,"No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.",Marshall
02x03,That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.,Barney
02x03,"Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.",Marshall
02x03,I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.,Barney
02x03,So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.,Ted from 2030
02x03,Hello.,Marshall
02x03,"Oh, hi.",Ted's father
02x03,"Hey, Marshall.",Ted
02x03,Hey.,Robin
02x03,Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.,Lily
02x03,"Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?",Marshall
02x03,"Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of...  What are you doing?",Lily
02x03,"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable.  Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.",Marshall
02x03,Take off your dress.,Marshall
02x03,Take off the rest of your pants.,Lily
02x03,I really wasn't expecting that to happen.,Lily
02x03,"Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?",Marshall
02x03,"Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.",Lily
02x03,"Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.",Marshall
02x03,"Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.",Lily
02x03,Seduce you? You seduced me.,Marshall
02x03,You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.,Lily
02x03,You went to San Francisco for three months.,Marshall
02x03,How is that seducing you?,Lily
02x03,"Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.",Marshall
02x03,"All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.",Lily
02x03,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.",Marshall
02x03,You are evil.,Lily
02x03,Smile!,The waitress 
02x03,I'm going to kll him.,Ted
02x03,I can't say I blame you.,Barney
02x03,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to kll him.",Ted
02x03,Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.,Ted from 2030
02x03,"This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous.","The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030"
02x03,"Barney, what are you doing here?",Ted
02x03,Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.,Barney
02x03,I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.,Ted
02x03,What?,Barney
02x03,"Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.",Ted
02x03,But I'm your best friend.,Barney
02x03,"Well, actually Marshall's my...",Ted
02x03,I'm the most important person in your life.,Barney
02x03,"Well, Robin's actually...",Ted
02x03,How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.,Barney
02x03,"To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.",Robin
02x03,"Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.",Barney
02x03,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Ted
02x03,Ted.,Ted's father
02x03,I know you've all been excited to meet...,Ted
02x03,Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint Bless This Mess pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen?,Barney
02x03,"Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",Ted
02x03,Hello.,Ted's father
02x03,Hello.,Robin
02x03,"Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?",Ted's mother
02x03,A real looker.,Ted's father
02x03,"That's funny, I didn't even look in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.",Robin
02x03,"San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.",Barney
02x03,I love salmon risotto.,Ted's mother
02x03,I know.,Barney
02x03,How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.,Robin
02x03,"Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...",Barney
02x03,"Stop it! Don't, don't!",Ted
02x03,"Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?",Barney
02x03,"What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.",Robin
02x03,"Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!",Barney
02x03,Can I help?,Ted's mother
02x03,"Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.",Barney
02x03,"Well, funny you should ask...",Ted's mother
02x03,"Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!",Barney
02x03,"That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.",Ted's mother
02x03,"No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.",Barney
02x03,"Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.",Lily
02x03,"All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.",Marshall
02x03,Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?,Barney
02x03,"No, I'm kind of tired.",Robin
02x03,"Me, too.",Lily
02x03,"Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...",Ted
02x03,I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.,Ted's father
02x03,Cervezas? Did he fall?,Ted
02x03,"I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.",Ted's mother
02x03,"St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.",Barney
02x03,Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,Ted
02x03,I'll save you a seat.,Barney
02x03,"Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?",Ted's mother
02x03,Robin.,Robin
02x03,"Susan, her name is Virginia.",Barney
02x03,"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.",Barney
02x03,Why?,Ted
02x03,"Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",Barney
02x03,"So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety.",Ted's father 
02x03,Wow. You're like a hero.,Girl
02x03,"Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",Barney
02x03,"You poor, brave man.",Girl
02x03,Why don't you give the guy a hug?,Ted's father
02x03,I'm... oh. .,Barney
02x03,"My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",Ted
02x03,"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.",Barney
02x03,Sure.,Ted
02x03,"Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",Barney
02x03,"Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!",Ted
02x03,I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?,Barney
02x03,"My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.",Ted
02x03,"Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83 of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.",Barney
02x03,"Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use 83?",Ted
02x03,"You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.",Barney
02x03,That's not a real Web site.,Ted
02x03,"Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.",Barney
02x03,"Hi, Dad.",Ted
02x03,"Hey, Ted. Barney!",Ted's father
02x03,Enjoying your vacation so far?,Ted
02x03,"Oh, yeah.",Ted's father
02x03,"Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?",Ted
02x03,Sure.,Ted's father
02x03,So you went out with Barney last night?,Ted
02x03,Yeah.,Ted's father
02x03,You have a good time?,Ted
02x03,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us.",Ted's father
02x03,Yeah. So...,Ted
02x03,What?,Ted's father
02x03,Well...,Ted
02x03,Well what?,Ted's father
02x03,You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?,Ted
02x03,"I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene",Ted
02x03,"Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.",Barney
02x03,Smile!,The waitress 
02x03,I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
02x03,Not now.,Ted's mother
02x03,"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
02x03,Robin...!,Ted's mother
02x03,"Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story.",Ted from 2030
02x03,We were expecting my parents at any minute.,Ted from 2030
02x03,One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.,Ted
02x03,But this is the first time she's meeting me.,Robin
02x03,Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.,Ted
02x03,But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?,Robin
02x03,You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.,Ted
02x03,I'm gonna lie.,Robin
02x03,I would.,Ted
02x03,Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.,Lily
02x03,I know how important it is to you.,Marshall
02x03,I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again.,Ted's mother
02x03,"Oh, good for her.",Ted
02x03,"So, dear...",Ted's mother 
02x03,"Oh, boy.",Robin
02x03,Tell us what it's like being a journalist.,Ted's mother
02x03,I'm just not ready.,Robin
02x03,Okay. No pressure.,Ted's mother
02x03,"Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.",Robin
02x03,"Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.",Ted's mother
02x03,"Ooh, a piano!",Barney
02x03,"You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?",Ted
02x03,"Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.",Robin
02x03,Hooray?,Ted
02x03,"I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.",Robin
02x03,"Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.",Ted
02x03,What happened to Marshall and Lily?,Barney
02x03,They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.,Ted
02x03,More coffee?,Waitress
02x03,"Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?",Ted's mother
02x03,"Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.",Robin
02x03,Excuse me?,Ted's mother
02x03,Nothing.,Robin
02x03,Just a minute.,Lily
02x03,Maybe less.,Marshall
02x03,"Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?",Ted's mother
02x03,Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?,Robin
02x03,Do you want to have my grandkids?,Ted's mother
02x03,"No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...",Robin
02x03,Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.,Marshall
02x03,"Marshall, your zipper.",Lily
02x03,"Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.",Ted's mother
02x03,"Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?",Robin
02x03,"Well... Okay, there's something you don't know...",Ted's mother
02x03,Smile!,Waitress
02x03,I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
02x03,I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
02x03,I'm gonna kll him.,Ted
02x03,"I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.",Robin
02x03,Not now.,Ted's mother
02x03,"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
02x03,Robin...!,Ted's mother
02x03,"Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart.",Ted's father
02x03,"Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy!  I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.",Ted
02x03,"Ted, what are you talking about?",Ted's mother
02x03,"Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?",Ted
02x03,Okay. I hooked up with a waitress.,Ted's father
02x03,Oh.,Ted's mother
02x03,Oh?,Ted
02x03,"I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh!",Ted's mother
02x03,"Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?",Ted
02x03,Mrs. Mosby?,Robin
02x03,"Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this...",Ted's mother
02x03,Your mother and I are divorced.,Ted's father
02x03,What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?,Ted
02x03,"Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now.",Ted's mother
02x03,"Closer to ten, I think.",Ted's father
02x03,Time flies.,Ted's mother
02x03,"So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?",Ted
02x03,"No, it wasn't a snap decision.",Ted's mother
02x03,We'd been separated almost two years.,Ted's father
02x03,How could you not tell me this?!,Ted
02x03,"We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.",Ted's mother
02x03,So last Christmas...?,Ted
02x03,"We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy.",Ted's father
02x03,I got you a tandem bike.,Ted
02x03,"Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time.",Ted's father
02x03,Who the hell is Frank?!,Ted
02x03,"Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.",Ted's father
02x03,"Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving.",Ted
02x03,"Teddy bear, oh...",Ted's mother
02x03,"You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.",Barney
02x03,Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.,Marshall
02x03,"Me, too.",Lily
02x03,I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,Marshall
02x03,It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.,Lily
02x03,"Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?",Marshall
02x03,Did you Mystic Tan your calves?,Lily
02x03,I withdraw the question.,Marshall
02x03,We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.,Outside.Ted's father
02x03,It was wrong not to tell you.,Ted's mother
02x03,Thank you.,Ted
02x03,"But listen, don't tell your sister.",Ted's father
02x03,It would just upset her.,Ted's mother
02x03,"No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.",Ted
02x03,Indians won today on a walk-off double.,Ted's father
02x03,"Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.",Ted
02x03,I never told you how I met your mother?,Ted's father
02x03,No.,Ted
02x03,"Oh, great story. At a bar.",Ted's father
02x03,"That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",Ted
02x03,I think it was an Irish bar.,Ted's father
02x03,"I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",Ted
02x03,We just realized we're very different people.,Ted's father
02x03,"Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.",Ted's mother
02x03,So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,Ted
02x03,I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.,Ted's father
02x03,Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,Ted
02x03,"On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.",Ted's mother
02x03,"Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.",Ted's father
02x03,But we love Robin.,Ted's mother
02x03,"Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.",Ted's father
02x03,We'll see you inside.,Ted's mother
02x03,Sorry.,Ted's father
02x03,Wow.,Robin
02x03,I know.,Ted
02x03,They love me!,Robin
02x03,So we are definitely going to try and communicate more.,"Back inside, later.Ted's mother"
02x03,"From now on, full disclosure.",Ted's father
02x03,"Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",Ted
02x03,I'm gonna get some juice.,Ted's mother
02x03,No. No.,Ted
02x03,You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker.,Ted's father
02x04,"Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is.",Ted from 2030
02x04,"Well, we just had our first fight.",Ted
02x04,We had our first fight.,Robin
02x04,"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? .",Barney
02x04,"A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",Ted
02x04,It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,Robin
02x04,"And if we don't get it, we could go under.",Ted
02x04,"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",Robin
02x04,No.,Barney
02x04,Yes.,Ted
02x04,"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",Marshall
02x04,"Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",Ted
02x04,"Wow, so it's the whole package.",Marshall
02x04,"Yeah, you did.",Barney
02x04,Had to.,Marshall
02x04,"Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",Barney
02x04,"Yeah, you did.",Marshall
02x04,Had to.,Barney
02x04,"It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",Ted
02x04,"Yeah, you did.",Marshall
02x04,That wasn't one.,Ted
02x04,"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",Lily
02x04,"Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",Robin
02x04,"Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",Lily
02x04,"The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",Robin
02x04,Hey.,Ted
02x04,Hey.,Robin
02x04,How was your day?,Ted
02x04,Good.,Robin
02x04,"Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",Ted
02x04,"No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",Robin
02x04,"You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",Ted
02x04,"Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",Robin
02x04,Robin!,Lily
02x04,What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,Robin
02x04,You should work at a su1c1de hotline.,Lily
02x04,And then it got ugly.,Robin
02x04,"What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.",Robin
02x04,So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?,Ted
02x04,It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,Robin
02x04,"So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",Robin
02x04,"Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",Lily
02x04,How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,Ted
02x04,"Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",Lily
02x04,I guess I don't know how to do that.,Robin
02x04,"Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",Lily
02x04,"No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",Robin
02x04,What the hell comes before Q?,Lily
02x04,"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",Ted
02x04,Can we talk about something else?,Barney
02x04,"You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",Marshall
02x04,"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",Barney
02x04,"That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",Marshall
02x04,"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",Barney
02x04,"I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",Ted
02x04,Your job's not boring.,Marshall
02x04,Robin thinks so.,Ted
02x04,"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",Barney
02x04,I love it when you quote Scripture.,Ted
02x04,"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",Barney
02x04,"Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",Ted
02x04,"That's 'cause you're always like...  Ted Mosby, architect. Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",Barney
02x04,"Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..",Marshall 
02x04,"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. Ted Mosby, architect. Trust me.",Barney
02x04,"Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",Ted
02x04,Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,Girl
02x04,Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,Ted
02x04,"Yes, she did.",Girl
02x04,Mm-hmm.,Ted
02x04,"Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",Robin
02x04,"No. Hey, Lily. You still single?",Carl
02x04,Yes.,Lily
02x04,You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.,Carl
02x04,"Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade sx for beer?",Lily
02x04,Only if you're into it. It's on me.,Carl
02x04,Thanks.,Lily
02x04,I wonder where Ted went.,Robin
02x04,"Ted Mosby, the architect?",A girl
02x04,"Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",Robin
02x04,And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?,Girl 1
02x04,"Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",Ted
02x04,"I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me.",Girl 1
02x04,"Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",Ted
02x04,Yeah.,Girls
02x04,"He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",Lily
02x04,"Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",Robin
02x04,"What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",Lily
02x04,"I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",Robin
02x04,She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.,Girl
02x04,"All right, we'll swing by the party.",Robin
02x04,"Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...",Ted from 2030
02x04,"Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",Robin
02x04,Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!,Guy 1
02x04,That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.,Ted from 2030
02x04,"Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",Lily
02x04,"Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!",Guy 2
02x04,"Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",Robin
02x04,"You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here.",Guy 2
02x04,"Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",Ted
02x04,Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.,Girl
02x04,I know you would. It's the job.,Ted
02x04,Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.,Guy 2 
02x04,No way.,Guy 1
02x04,"Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?",Girl 2
02x04,"I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",Marshall
02x04,"Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move.",Guy 2
02x04,"Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",Marshall
02x04,"And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days.",Girl 2
02x04,"Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",Marshall
02x04,You should sue her.,Girl 2
02x04,"Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",Marshall
02x04,On the grounds of... shut up.,Kara
02x04,That's our Attorney General.,Ted from 2030
02x04,See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,Lily
02x04,"Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",Robin
02x04,The girl with the smackable ass.,Guy 2
02x04,"Yes, that's the young lady.",Robin
02x04,"So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?",Girl
02x04,"Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",Robin
02x04,"Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",Ted
02x04,Yay!,Girl
02x04,"Wait, let me just check with my friend.",Ted
02x04,Okay.,Girl
02x04,"Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",Ted
02x04,Um... only always.,Marshall
02x04,Let's go.,Ted
02x04,"Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to sx.",Robin
02x04,Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,Lily
02x04,"I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",Robin
02x04,"Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",Lily
02x04,He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,Robin
02x04,Hello.,Marshall
02x04,"Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",Robin
02x04,"Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",Marshall
02x04,"Uh, okay. Bye.  Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.",Robin
02x04,"Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating bstrd.",Robin
02x04,You're going to need to refresh my memory.,Bouncer
02x04,"Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a 20 help your memory?",Lily
02x04,"Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory.",Bouncer
02x04,Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,Lily
02x04,So these guys... One of them's an architect.,Robin
02x04,"Ted Mosby, the architect?",Bouncer
02x04,That's the one.,Robin
02x04,"Oh, yeah, he was here.",Bouncer
02x04,"And then I was all, No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time. And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",Ted
02x04,I live across the street.,Girl
02x04,That is one hell of a non sequitur.,Ted
02x04,You want to come over?,Girl
02x04,"Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on.",Ted
02x04,"I'll see you at book club, Vinny.",Girl 
02x04,Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudits.,Bouncer
02x04,Nice. Giddy up!,Girl
02x04,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
02x04,Galloping.,Ted
02x04,"You proved it, all right? The whole Ted Mosby, architect things works.",Marshall
02x04,Architects rule! Whoo-hee!,Girl
02x04,"Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
02x04,It is tonight. Whoo!,Ted
02x04,You know this girl. Where does she live?,Robin
02x04,I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.,Bouncer
02x04,"Well, I'm out of money.",Lily
02x04,"I'm cashed, too.",Robin
02x04,I'll take your purse.,Bouncer
02x04,My purse?,Robin
02x04,"Yeah, my girl likes clutches.",Bouncer
02x04,"Okay, fine.",Robin
02x04,You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,Lily
02x04,Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gn. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,Robin
02x04,"The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.",Bouncer
02x04,"Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",Lily
02x04,Yeah... And steal her purse.,Robin
02x04,"I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",Robin
02x04,"3-C, let's do this. You ready?",Lily
02x04,Should I just kick the door in?,Robin
02x04,"Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",Lily
02x04,I'm the problem.,Robin
02x04,What?,Lily
02x04,You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,Robin
02x04,"Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",Lily
02x04,Let's do this.,Robin
02x04,Bring it.,Lily
02x04,What do you think you're...? Barney?,Robin
02x04,Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.,Barney
02x04,"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",Robin
02x04,Ted? He's at work.,Barney
02x04,How did you get here?,Robin
02x04,Awesome story. As per usual.,Barney
02x04,How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,Girl
02x04,Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,Ted
02x04,"Yes, she did.",Girl
02x04,"Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.",Barney
02x04,"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",Ted
02x04,Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.,Girl
02x04,"Yeah, stay",Barney
02x04,"Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.",Ted
02x04,"Yeah, you did.",Barney
02x04,"Yeah, had to. See ya.",Ted
02x04,"Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.",Barney
02x04,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.",Girl
02x04,Ted Mosby... Architect.,Barney
02x04,But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,Barney
02x04,"Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!",Anna
02x04,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
02x04,Galloping.,Barney
02x04,"All right, you proved it. The whole Ted Mosby, architect thing works.",Marshall
02x04,Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.,Anna
02x04,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
02x04,It is tonight.,Barney
02x04,"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",Barney
02x04,But why would you use Ted's name?,Robin
02x04,I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole using my real name thing.,Barney
02x04,"Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",Lily
02x04,Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,Robin
02x04,This is how people act in relationships.,Lily
02x04,And that's why I avoid relationships.,Robin
02x04,"Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",Lily
02x04,"And thus ended this chapter of, Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand. Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",Barney
02x04,You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,Robin
02x04,"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a A. A... A... I'll just put resident. Go, go, go, go.",Barney
02x04,Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.,Ted from 2030
02x04,Hey.,Robin
02x04,Hey. What are you doing here?,Ted
02x04,"I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",Robin
02x04,"Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",Ted
02x04,It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,Robin
02x04,You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,Ted
02x04,"Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.",Robin
02x04,What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,Ted
02x04,"Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",Robin
02x04,"Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",Ted
02x04,Obviously. Wow.,Robin
02x04,Yes.,Ted
02x04,"You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.",Robin
02x04,"You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?",Ted
02x04,You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.,Ted from 2030
02x04,"Wow. Ted, this is amazing.",Robin
02x04,Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.,Ted
02x04,"I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot.",Robin
02x04,"Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything.",Ted
02x04,"Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond. Barney.",Barney
02x04,Barney? Who the hell is Barney?,Anna
02x05,"Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did.",Ted 
02x05,Aaaaaaah!,Barney
02x05,Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
02x05,"It's a pretty good story. And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role. It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming.",Ted 
02x05,Welcome to my new home.,Lily
02x05,"Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.",Ted
02x05,"Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.",Lily
02x05,"Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?",Ted
02x05,Or a stove in your bathroom?,Robin
02x05,"Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator: a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic?",Lily
02x05,"God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.",Ted
02x05,"It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...",Lily
02x05,Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.,Robin
02x05,"Hold on, I got it.",Ted
02x05,"That was something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.",Lily
02x05,Uh. Other cultures!,Robin
02x05,"Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...?  Aaaaaah!",Lily
02x05,"Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.",Ted
02x05,"I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.",Robin
02x05,Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.,Ted
02x05,"What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.",Robin
02x05,The fortress of barnitude? No way.,Barney
02x05,Come on. She's desperate.,Robin
02x05,"Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.",Barney
02x05,"One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?",Marshall 
02x05,Absolutely not.,Robin
02x05,No.,Ted
02x05,"Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!",Marshall
02x05,"Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.",Ted
02x05,"Oh, you don't think I've tried?",Marshall
02x05,Table for one.,Marshall
02x05,One... Couple?,Head waiter
02x05,"Um, no, just me.",Marshall
02x05,Really? For brunch?,Head waiter
02x05,You're right. Who am I kidding?,Marshall
02x05,"Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?",Robin
02x05,"Of course, sweetie.",Ted
02x05,Can I go with you guys?,Marshall
02x05,Really? For brunch?,Ted
02x05,"God, I hate being single!",Marshall
02x05,Ted gave me your spare key.,Lily
02x05,Spare key! Brilliant!,Ted
02x05,"I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...",Lily
02x05,"That's terrible. Well, see ya.",Barney
02x05,"Wait, can I stay here maybe?",Lily
02x05,"I'd let you, but I don't have any room.",Barney
02x05,You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.,Lily
02x05,"Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a sx visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.",Barney
02x05,"Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.",Lily
02x05,"Wow, you really are desperate.",Barney
02x05,I really am.,Lily
02x05,"Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.",Barney
02x05,Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.,Lily
02x05,"See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.",Barney
02x05,It hurts my eyes.,Lily
02x05,Yeah. That doesn't go away.,Barney
02x05,"Hey, where have you been?",Ted
02x05,The Alanis Morissette concert.,Marshall
02x05,By yourself?,Ted
02x05,"No,actually I went with a friend from law school.",Marshall
02x05,"Oh,really? Who's this friend?",Robin
02x05,Brad.,Marshall
02x05,"Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!",Brad
02x05,Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.,Marshall
02x05,Let me guess: you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you.,Brad
02x05,"Yeah, how'd you know?",Marshall
02x05,I just got dumped myself.,Brad
02x05,"What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?",Marshall
02x05,You invited him to brunch?,Ted
02x05,"Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?",Marshall
02x05,Yes. That's why I was all you invited him to brunch?,Ted
02x05,Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?,Marshall
02x05,Because brunch is kind of...,Ted
02x05,Girly.,Robin
02x05,Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?,Marshall
02x05,"I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.",Ted
02x05,"I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.",Marshall
02x05,"Uhm, smells delicious.",Barney
02x05,"Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...  What are you doing?",Lily
02x05,"Lily, what was the first rule again?",Barney
02x05,Don't change anything?,Lily
02x05,And what was the second rule?,Barney
02x05,There was no second rule.,Lily
02x05,Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.,Barney
02x05,I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?,Lily
02x05,"Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says our work here is done. Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gracirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their prn...",Barney
02x05,Marshall doesn't have prn.,Lily
02x05,"Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their prn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.",Barney
02x05,"And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.",Lily
02x05,"No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.",Barney
02x05,"God, I love brunch.",Marshall
02x05,"Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous.",Brad
02x05,"This isn't weird, right?",Marshall
02x05,"I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny.",Brad
02x05,Right? Right?,Marshall
02x05,"I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?",Brad
02x05,"Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.",Marshall
02x05,This must be destiny.,Brad
02x05,What are you talking about?,Marshall
02x05,"I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?",Brad
02x05,Yeah!,Marshall
02x05,Hey. Did the cold wake you?,Barney
02x05,"No,I've just been watching you sleep.",Girl
02x05,"Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.",Barney
02x05,I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.,Girl
02x05,"Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...",Barney
02x05,"I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.",Girl
02x05,"I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look  Oh, I'm disgusting.",Barney
02x05,"Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you.",Girl
02x05,"Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...",Barney
02x05,Barney... Oh!,Lily 
02x05,Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?,Girl
02x05,What? No. Yes!,Barney
02x05,Yes?,Girl
02x05,Yes.,Barney
02x05,You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.,Girl
02x05,"Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?  You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.",Barney
02x05,"Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?",Lily
02x05,She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than prn.,Barney
02x05,Thank you.,Lily
02x05,"How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",Barney
02x05,I'll do it.,Lily
02x05,Really?,Barney
02x05,"Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",Lily
02x05,I'll take it.,Barney
02x05,Mamma mia!?,Ted
02x05,"Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff.",Marshall
02x05,"No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.",Ted
02x05,"Ooh, third date. You know what that means.",Robin
02x05,"It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.",Marshall
02x05,You bros going to get dinner beforehand?,Ted
02x05,"We might grab a steak, yeah.",Marshall
02x05,Where at?,Ted
02x05,"Caf l'amour.  Brad says the food is really good there, okay?",Marshall
02x05,Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your A game. That means no granny panties.,Robin
02x05,"All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",Marshall
02x05,What are you going to wear?,Ted
02x05,"I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...  Oh, you know what? Shut up.",Marshall
02x05,Can you pass the arts and leisure?  Can you pass the arts and leisure?,Barney
02x05,I just did.,Girl
02x05,"Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?",Lily 
02x05,"Lily, I can explain...",Barney
02x05,How could you? In our own home?  You bstrd!,Lily
02x05,I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...,Girl
02x05,Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I...  I was just about to turn on the tears.,Lily
02x05,Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.,Barney
02x05,"Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.",Lily
02x05,"Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.",Barney
02x05,"You know... Oh nah, never mind.",Lily
02x05,What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.,Barney
02x05,"Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.",Lily
02x05,What did you have in mind?,Barney
02x05,"Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.",Ted
02x05,"Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.",Marshall
02x05,"Oh, you really don't have to do that.",Marshall
02x05,"No, I insist. You're my guest.",Brad
02x05,"Thanks, Brad.",Marshall
02x05,Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy.,Brad
02x05,Woah!,Ted
02x05,"Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.",Robin
02x05,It gets worse.,Marshall
02x05,"No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.",Marshall
02x05,"So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?",Brad
02x05,You want me to go to a wedding with you?,Marshall
02x05,"Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like Wedding crashers.",Ted
02x05,Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.,Robin
02x05,It gets worse.,Marshall
02x05,It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.,Brad
02x05,Vermont?,Marshall
02x05,"Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome BB. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro.",Brad
02x05,"You said no, right?",Ted
02x05,Of course.,Marshall
02x05,I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much.,Brad
02x05,I'll go to Vermont with you.,Marshall
02x05,"That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.",Brad
02x05,I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.,Ted
02x05,"Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?",Marshall
02x05,"Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.",Ted
02x05,And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up.,Robin
02x05,"You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.",Marshall
02x05,Good man.,Ted
02x05,"Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.",Lily
02x05,"Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?",Barney
02x05,Oh. Ooooh!,Lily 
02x05,"All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?",Barney
02x05,"Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here.  Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?",Lily
02x05,Please.,Barney
02x05,I thought you were going out.,Lily
02x05,Eh. After the monologue.,Barney
02x05,"The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there...",Ted 
02x05,"No. No... No. No! No!  Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers.",Marshall
02x05,Hold on.,Ted
02x05,"Oh, hey...",Brad
02x05,"No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...",Marshall
02x05,"Hey,sweetie.",Girl
02x05,Hey.,Brad
02x05,"Aww. Hey, Marshall.",Girl
02x05,"Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?",Marshall
02x05,"Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you.",Brad
02x05,"Yeah, you should have.",Marshall
02x05,"Well, I didn't mean to hurt...",Brad
02x05,"Don't, Brad. Just don't.",Marshall
02x05,"Oh, what was with him?",Kara
02x05,I don't know. I think he's in love with me.,Brad
02x05,Aaaaaah!,Barney
02x05,Aaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
02x05,I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?,Barney
02x05,Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.,Lily
02x05,Just went to sleep? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.,Barney
02x05,"Hey,it takes two to cuddle.",Lily
02x05,"We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch Letterman, and then slept together and didn't have sx? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!",Barney
02x05,That's what you think a relationship is?,Lily
02x05,"You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.",Barney
02x05,"Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.",Lily
02x05,Uh-uh. You gotta go.,Barney
02x05,"Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.",Lily
02x05,A certain standard of living? You didn't pay a single...,Barney
02x05,"And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.",Ted 
02x05,Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.,Ted 
02x05,"Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny.",Marshall
02x05,That was great.,Ted
02x05,Right? Right?,Marshall
02x05,"Hey, Marshall.",Brad
02x05,"Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?",Marshall
02x05,"It's good.  Hey, I'm uh...",Brad
02x05,"Yeah, I know who you are.",Ted
02x05,"Well,I got to go. I got this thing.",Brad
02x05,"Yeah, me too, but more important.",Marshall
02x05,"So, I guess I'll see you around.",Brad
02x05,"Sure. Sure.  Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.",Marshall
02x05,Totally looks fat.,Ted
02x06,"Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.",Ted from 2030
02x06,It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,Lily
02x06,And she did find it.,Ted from 2030
02x06,I'm going to be a life coach.,Lily 
02x06,"In fact, she found it again and again.",Ted from 2030
02x06,I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily
02x06,Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.,Robin 
02x06,What is she doing for money through all this?,Ted
02x06,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
02x06,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
02x06,No.,Robin
02x06,Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
02x06,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
02x06,I'm sorry.,Robin
02x06,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",Barney
02x06,What do you want?,Lily
02x06,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
02x06,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
02x06,I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
02x06,No.,Ted
02x06,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
02x06,"Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
02x06,No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
02x06,Thank you.,Lily
02x06,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
02x06,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
02x06,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, dude, my semester is gonna be this.",Ted
02x06,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
02x06,"Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
02x06,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
02x06,She hot?,Barney
02x06,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
02x06,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
02x06,A what?,Robin
02x06,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
02x06,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
02x06,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney
02x06,I didn't challenge you to have sx with...,Marshall
02x06,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",Barney
02x06,"So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...",Lily 
02x06,Classic.,Marshall
02x06,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",Robin
02x06,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,Ted
02x06,"So, where should we eat today?",Ted
02x06,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
02x06,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
02x06,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
02x06,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
02x06,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
02x06,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
02x06,What would I be doing?,Lily
02x06,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
02x06,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
02x06,"Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
02x06,Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
02x06,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,Lily
02x06,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
02x06,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
02x06,I know.,Ted
02x06,And the way it...,Lily
02x06,I know.,Ted
02x06,And the two little...,Lily
02x06,I know.,Ted
02x06,It is just...,Lily
02x06,"Spectacular? Why, thank you.",Mr Druthers 
02x06,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
02x06,Ah.,Mr Druthers
02x06,Nice to meet you.,Lily
02x06,"Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",Mr Druthers
02x06,"I, uh... I am an architect.",Ted
02x06,"Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",Ted
02x06,"Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",Mr Druthers
02x06,Absolutely.,Ted
02x06,So you're going to design the...,Mr Druthers
02x06,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
02x06,"Once again, with feeling.",Mr Druthers
02x06,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
02x06,Styrofoam trees!,Mr Druthers
02x06,Styrofoam trees!,Ted
02x06,"That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm?",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Man, that guy is a total, well...",Lily
02x06,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",Marshall
02x06,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",Barney
02x06,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",Marshall
02x06,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",Barney
02x06,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",Marshall
02x06,"Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",Barney
02x06,Tell me what you want or get out.,Pr Lewis
02x06,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Barney
02x06,Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.,Pr Lewis
02x06,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,Lily
02x06,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. . All right stop.",Ted
02x06,Did you show lily your design?,Robin
02x06,No.,Ted
02x06,What design?,Lily
02x06,It's nothing.,Ted
02x06,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",Robin
02x06,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",Lily
02x06,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!",Ted
02x06,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",Barney
02x06,Hmm... C minus.,Pr Lewis
02x06,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Barney
02x06,"You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",Pr Lewis
02x06,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,Lily
02x06,"Okay, I'm done.",Ted
02x06,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,Lily
02x06,Great. Thanks.,Ted
02x06,"Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",Ted
02x06,Too green.,Mr Druthers
02x06,Too green?,Ted
02x06,"Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",Mr Druthers
02x06,I can't un-picture it.,Ted
02x06,"Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",Mr Druthers
02x06,What? What's gone?,Ted
02x06,My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Mr Druthers
02x06,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",Ted
02x06,"What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",Ted
02x06,"Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints?",Ted
02x06,Hey.,Lily
02x06,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",Ted
02x06,That's easy. I took it.,Lily
02x06,Why?,Ted
02x06,It's simple.,Lily
02x06,"Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",Mr Druthers
02x06,"What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",Mr Druthers 
02x06,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",Lily
02x06,What does his ball have to do with anything?,Ted
02x06,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",Lily
02x06,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",Robin
02x06,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Ted
02x06,Why? Was he being mean?,Robin
02x06,You know about this?,Ted
02x06,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,Robin
02x06,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",Lily
02x06,I gave them to you for your birthday.,Robin
02x06,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,Ted
02x06,I prefer to call them justice khakis.,Lily
02x06,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",Ted
02x06,So is being mean.,Lily
02x06,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",Ted
02x06,"Well, that's why I left a note.",Lily
02x06,A note?,Ted
02x06,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",Lily
02x06,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",Ted
02x06,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,Lily
02x06,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",Marshall
02x06,"I know, I know.",Barney
02x06,You claim to have so much sx. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,Marshall
02x06,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney
02x06,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",Marshall
02x06,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",Barney
02x06,I think I'm falling in love with you.,Barney
02x06,"Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",Pr Lewis
02x06,What? No.We had sx yesterday.,Barney
02x06,"Oh, right. That. Well, you had sx yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",Pr Lewis
02x06,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, who wants espresso? So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
02x06,No.,Lily
02x06,"What do you mean, no?",Ted
02x06,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",Lily
02x06,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",Ted
02x06,Everybody get in here now!,Mr Druthers
02x06,Who wants espresso?,Lily
02x06,"Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",Mr Druthers
02x06,Interesting.,Lily
02x06,"Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever allegedly did!",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",Lily
02x06,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,Ted
02x06,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",Lily
02x06,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
02x06,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
02x06,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
02x06,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
02x06,Then you're fired.,Ted
02x06,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
02x06,"Dude, you're klling me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall
02x06,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,Barney
02x06,So you're going back over there?,Marshall
02x06,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",Barney
02x06,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
02x06,"Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",Pr Lewis
02x06,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
02x06,Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.,Pr Lewis
02x06,"Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",Mr Druthers
02x06,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
02x06,"Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",Mr Druthers
02x06,Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
02x06,You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,Mr Druthers
02x06,Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted
02x06,"Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",Mr Druthers
02x06,The clients are here.,Man
02x06,Excellent. Bring them in.,Mr Druthers
02x06,Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,Ted from 2030
02x06,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",Mr Druthers
02x06,That's a pen1s!,Client
02x06,That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,Mr Druthers
02x06,We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?,Client
02x06,Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,Mr Druthers
02x06,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",Client
02x06,The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,Ted from 2030
02x06,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,Ted
02x06,"Ted, what are you doing?",Mr Druthers
02x06,I have another design.,Ted
02x06,"Sit down, shut up right now.",Mr Druthers
02x06,No.,Ted
02x06,To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,Robin
02x06,Probably!,All
02x06,"Congrats, ted.",Lily
02x06,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",Ted
02x06,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",Lily
02x06,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",Ted
02x06,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",Lily
02x06,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",Lily
02x06,"Barney! Oh, my god!",Robin
02x06,What happened?,Ted
02x06,He broke his hip.,Pr Lewis
02x06,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",Barney
02x06,"No, he's not fine.",Pr Lewis
02x06,"Professor Lewis, hi.",Marshall
02x06,Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.,Pr Lewis
02x06,"Yeah, she was.",Barney
02x06,B plus.,Pr Lewis
02x06,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that A!",Barney
02x06,Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,Marshall
02x06,It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!,Barney
02x07,"Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.",Ted from 2030
02x07,It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,Lily
02x07,And she did find it.,Ted from 2030
02x07,I'm going to be a life coach.,Lily 
02x07,"In fact, she found it again and again.",Ted from 2030
02x07,I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily
02x07,Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.,Robin 
02x07,What is she doing for money through all this?,Ted
02x07,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
02x07,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
02x07,No.,Robin
02x07,Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
02x07,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
02x07,I'm sorry.,Robin
02x07,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",Barney
02x07,What do you want?,Lily
02x07,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
02x07,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
02x07,I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
02x07,No.,Ted
02x07,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
02x07,"Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
02x07,No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
02x07,Thank you.,Lily
02x07,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
02x07,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
02x07,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, dude, my semester is gonna be this.",Ted
02x07,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
02x07,"Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
02x07,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
02x07,She hot?,Barney
02x07,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
02x07,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
02x07,A what?,Robin
02x07,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
02x07,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
02x07,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney
02x07,I didn't challenge you to have sx with...,Marshall
02x07,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",Barney
02x07,"So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...",Lily 
02x07,Classic.,Marshall
02x07,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",Robin
02x07,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,Ted
02x07,"So, where should we eat today?",Ted
02x07,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
02x07,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
02x07,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
02x07,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
02x07,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
02x07,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
02x07,What would I be doing?,Lily
02x07,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
02x07,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
02x07,"Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
02x07,Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
02x07,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,Lily
02x07,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
02x07,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
02x07,I know.,Ted
02x07,And the way it...,Lily
02x07,I know.,Ted
02x07,And the two little...,Lily
02x07,I know.,Ted
02x07,It is just...,Lily
02x07,"Spectacular? Why, thank you.",Mr Druthers 
02x07,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
02x07,Ah.,Mr Druthers
02x07,Nice to meet you.,Lily
02x07,"Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",Mr Druthers
02x07,"I, uh... I am an architect.",Ted
02x07,"Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",Ted
02x07,"Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",Mr Druthers
02x07,Absolutely.,Ted
02x07,So you're going to design the...,Mr Druthers
02x07,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
02x07,"Once again, with feeling.",Mr Druthers
02x07,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
02x07,Styrofoam trees!,Mr Druthers
02x07,Styrofoam trees!,Ted
02x07,"That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm?",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Man, that guy is a total, well...",Lily
02x07,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",Marshall
02x07,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",Barney
02x07,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",Marshall
02x07,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",Barney
02x07,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",Marshall
02x07,"Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",Barney
02x07,Tell me what you want or get out.,Pr Lewis
02x07,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Barney
02x07,Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.,Pr Lewis
02x07,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,Lily
02x07,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. . All right stop.",Ted
02x07,Did you show lily your design?,Robin
02x07,No.,Ted
02x07,What design?,Lily
02x07,It's nothing.,Ted
02x07,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",Robin
02x07,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",Lily
02x07,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!",Ted
02x07,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",Barney
02x07,Hmm... C minus.,Pr Lewis
02x07,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Barney
02x07,"You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",Pr Lewis
02x07,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,Lily
02x07,"Okay, I'm done.",Ted
02x07,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,Lily
02x07,Great. Thanks.,Ted
02x07,"Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",Ted
02x07,Too green.,Mr Druthers
02x07,Too green?,Ted
02x07,"Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",Mr Druthers
02x07,I can't un-picture it.,Ted
02x07,"Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",Mr Druthers
02x07,What? What's gone?,Ted
02x07,My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Mr Druthers
02x07,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",Ted
02x07,"What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",Ted
02x07,"Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints?",Ted
02x07,Hey.,Lily
02x07,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",Ted
02x07,That's easy. I took it.,Lily
02x07,Why?,Ted
02x07,It's simple.,Lily
02x07,"Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",Mr Druthers
02x07,"What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",Mr Druthers 
02x07,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",Lily
02x07,What does his ball have to do with anything?,Ted
02x07,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",Lily
02x07,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",Robin
02x07,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Ted
02x07,Why? Was he being mean?,Robin
02x07,You know about this?,Ted
02x07,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,Robin
02x07,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",Lily
02x07,I gave them to you for your birthday.,Robin
02x07,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,Ted
02x07,I prefer to call them justice khakis.,Lily
02x07,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",Ted
02x07,So is being mean.,Lily
02x07,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",Ted
02x07,"Well, that's why I left a note.",Lily

02x07,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",Ted
02x07,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,Lily
02x07,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",Marshall
02x07,"I know, I know.",Barney
02x07,You claim to have so much sx. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,Marshall
02x07,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney

02x07,What? No.We had sx yesterday.,Barney
02x07,"Oh, right. That. Well, you had sx yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",Pr Lewis
02x07,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, who wants espresso? So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
02x07,No.,Lily
02x07,"What do you mean, no?",Ted
02x07,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",Lily
02x07,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",Ted

And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever allegedly did!",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",Lily
02x07,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,Ted
02x07,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",Lily
02x07,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
02x07,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
02x07,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
02x07,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
02x07,Then you're fired.,Ted
02x07,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
02x07,"Dude, you're klling me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall
02x07,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,Barney
02x07,So you're going back over there?,Marshall
02x07,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",Barney
02x07,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
02x07,"Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",Pr Lewis
02x07,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
02x07,Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.,Pr Lewis
02x07,"Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",Mr Druthers
02x07,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
02x07,"Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",Mr Druthers
02x07,Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
02x07,You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,Mr Druthers
02x07,Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted
02x07,"Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",Mr Druthers
02x07,The clients are here.,Man
02x07,Excellent. Bring them in.,Mr Druthers
02x07,Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,Ted from 2030
02x07,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",Mr Druthers
02x07,That's a pen1s!,Client
02x07,That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,Mr Druthers
02x07,We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?,Client
02x07,Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,Mr Druthers
02x07,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",Client
02x07,The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,Ted from 2030
02x07,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,Ted
02x07,"Ted, what are you doing?",Mr Druthers
02x07,I have another design.,Ted
02x07,"Sit down, shut up right now.",Mr Druthers
02x07,No.,Ted
02x07,To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,Robin
02x07,Probably!,All
02x07,"Congrats, ted.",Lily
02x07,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",Ted
02x07,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",Lily
02x07,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",Ted
02x07,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",Lily
02x07,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",Lily
02x07,"Barney! Oh, my god!",Robin
02x07,What happened?,Ted
02x07,He broke his hip.,Pr Lewis
02x07,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",Barney
02x07,"No, he's not fine.",Pr Lewis
02x07,"Professor Lewis, hi.",Marshall
02x07,Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.,Pr Lewis
02x07,"Yeah, she was.",Barney
02x07,B plus.,Pr Lewis
02x07,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that A!",Barney
02x07,Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,Marshall
02x07,It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!,Barney
02x08,"And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.",Ted from 2030
02x08,"Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!",Lily
02x08,"Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.",Marshall
02x08,Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?,Lily
02x08,"Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?",Marshall
02x08,And things were back to normal... Almost.,Ted from 2030
02x08,"You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.",Lily
02x08,"Oh, uhm...",Marshall
02x08,"I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?",Lily
02x08,Really?,Marshall
02x08,"Of course, I love you.",Lily
02x08,"No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? Do you still wanna? That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.",Marshall
02x08,"Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...",Lily 
02x08,"No, no, no, no, no, no.",Marshall
02x08,What?!,Lily
02x08,"You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.",Marshall
02x08,Do you remember your proposal to me?,Lily
02x08,I had a speech prepared.,Marshall
02x08,What do you want to hear?,Lily
02x08,"I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.",Marshall
02x08,Marshall... You are good-looking...,Lily
02x08,Thank you.,Marshall
02x08,Funny...,Lily
02x08,"Oh, thanks.",Marshall
02x08,Smart...,Lily
02x08,And a few tears wouldn't hurt.,Marshall
02x08,"Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?",Lily
02x08,"I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.",Marshall
02x08,"Yeah, right.",Lily
02x08,I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.,Marshall
02x08,"I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!",Lily
02x08,"I know, I know.",Marshall
02x08,"It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family.",Ted from 2030
02x08,"Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?",Lily
02x08,"It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?",Marshall
02x08,"God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.",Lily
02x08,Yeah...,Marshall
02x08,Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.,Robin
02x08,Robin! Stop the news!,Marshall
02x08,What the hell?,Woman
02x08,It's okay. They're my friends.,Robin
02x08,We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.,Lily
02x08,"Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.",Robin
02x08,"It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight.  Hey, Mike... You can read, right?",Woman
02x08,"Yeah, I'm the best at reading.",Mike
02x08,Let's go to Atlantic City!,Robin
02x08,Yeah!,All
02x08,"You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?",Ted
02x08,I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.,Lily
02x08,"Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",Ted
02x08,"Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",Lily
02x08,Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!,Ted
02x08,Yeah!,Marshall
02x08,"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",Ted
02x08,You got it.,Marshall
02x08,"Hey, guys.",Barney
02x08,Wow. A pedicure.,Ted
02x08,"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",Barney
02x08,We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,Lily
02x08,"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",Barney
02x08,So are you in or not?,Marshall
02x08,"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",Barney
02x08,"No, we got to get going to the...",Marshall
02x08,"Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...",Lily
02x08,So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.,Ted from 2030
02x08,Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.,Lily
02x08,And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,Marshall
02x08,"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",Barney
02x08,You been here before?,Ted
02x08,"Oh, uh, once or twice.",Barney
02x08,Barney!,Chinese 1
02x08,"Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",Barney
02x08,The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?,Lily
02x08,I'm ready. Let's get married.,Marshall
02x08,Yeah.,Barney
02x08,"Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",Lily
02x08,"Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",Robin
02x08,"Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",Lily
02x08,"Oh, really? Thanks.",Robin
02x08,"Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.",Lily
02x08,Done.,Robin
02x08,I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break.,Lily
02x08,You guys want to go gamble?,Ted
02x08,"No, we got to go get the veil.",Marshall
02x08,"Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",Ted
02x08,"Yeah, okay.",Marshall
02x08,"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil.",Barney
02x08,"So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.",Ted
02x08,Thanks.,Marshall
02x08,How are you feeling?,Ted
02x08,"Great, a little nervous.",Marshall
02x08,Yeah? Craps?,Ted
02x08,Not that nervous.,Marshall
02x08,"No, I mean do you want to play craps.",Ted
02x08,"Oh, yeah, definitely.",Marshall
02x08,"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",Barney
02x08,What did you just say?,Ted
02x08,"Barney, no.",Marshall
02x08,"Marshall, I'm your best man.",Barney
02x08,You're not my best man.,Marshall
02x08,Right here.,Ted
02x08,"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",Barney
02x08,You're not my best friend.,Marshall
02x08,Right here.,Ted
02x08,"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",Marshall
02x08,18 minutes...,Ted
02x08,"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",Lily
02x08,Of course.,Barney
02x08,And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.,Marshall
02x08,Dude!,Ted
02x08,Unbelievable!,Barney
02x08,We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.,Marshall
02x08,Your last lap dance ever.,Lily
02x08,Right. What?,Marshall
02x08,"Okay, I'm here. Right?",Robin 
02x08,"Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",Ted
02x08,Does it smell like strippers in here?,Robin
02x08,"That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",Ted
02x08,"Hell, yeah, look at this.",Lily
02x08,"Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",Marshall
02x08,Hi. We're here to get married.,Lily
02x08,Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.,Woman
02x08,We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.,Marshall
02x08,"Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?",Woman
02x08,"Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",Robin
02x08,What?,Ted 
02x08,It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.,Woman
02x08,"No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",Lily
02x08,"Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.",Woman
02x08,"Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",Ted
02x08,"Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.",Woman
02x08,Have you been outside?,Lily
02x08,There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.,Ted
02x08,"You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",Marshall
02x08,"About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",Woman
02x08,Bright side: the bachelor party continues!,Barney
02x08,Yes! Continues? You mean start. He means start. We went to a strip club.,Ted
02x08,Twenty-seven.,Woman
02x08,Is there any way that we could get a license today?,Lily
02x08,"You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.",Woman
02x08,"Well, we're in love.",Lily
02x08,What better reason could there be?,Marshall
02x08,"The last one I heard was, I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country, but, you know, give yours a whirl.",Woman
02x08,So we went to the courthouse.,Ted from 2030
02x08,"God, this is taking forever.",Marshall
02x08,Can't believe they're getting married.,Robin 
02x08,"I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",Ted
02x08,"Ted, up here.",Robin
02x08,Uhm?,Ted
02x08,You were just staring at my shirt boobs.,Robin
02x08,"No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",Ted
02x08,"Hey, it's Barney! Barney!",Chinese 2
02x08,Hi.,Barney
02x08,Legen-...-dary!,Chinese 2
02x08,See you.,Barney
02x08,What the hell was that?,Ted
02x08,A... Chinese guy?,Barney
02x08,"Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",Marshall
02x08,Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.,Woman 2
02x08,"Oh, really?!",Lily
02x08,"Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.",Woman 2
02x08,"Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",Lily
02x08,Absolutely.,Woman 2
02x08,Really?!,Lily
02x08,"Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.",Woman 2
02x08,Why are you doing this to us?!,Marshall
02x08,'Cause you're on Candid Camera!,Woman 2
02x08,Really?!,Robin
02x08,Is what I would say...,Woman 2
02x08,You know what? We get it.,Marshall
02x08,"Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",Lily
02x08,"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",Marshall
02x08,Vultures.,Barney
02x08,What? Here?,Robin
02x08,Yeah. Got a little time to kll.,Ted
02x08,"Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",Robin
02x08,No. A little.,Ted
02x08,Something is seriously wrong with you.,Robin
02x08,"So what, is that a no?",Ted
02x08,"All right, let's do it.",Robin
02x08,"All right. Um, also...?",Ted
02x08,"Yes, I'll leave it on.",Robin
02x08,Sweet.,Ted
02x08,"Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.",Barney
02x08,"Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",Lily
02x08,"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bllet.",Barney
02x08,"Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",Lily
02x08,Turn it off.,Judge
02x08,Okay. May we please get married today?,Lily
02x08,"Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?",Judge
02x08,What was what?,Lily
02x08,That little look. What was that?,Judge
02x08,A look of love.,Marshall
02x08,"You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?",Judge
02x08,"You know, what's thick? what's thin?",Marshall
02x08,"Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",Lily
02x08,I have.,Marshall
02x08,"All right, what was that look? What's going on?",Judge
02x08,They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sx in the closet. What? We're under oath.,Barney
02x08,"No, we're not.",Ted
02x08,"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",Barney
02x08,Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,Ted
02x08,"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",Barney
02x08,Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.,Marshall
02x08,"No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",Lily
02x08,"Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",Marshall
02x08,Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.,Lily
02x08,"Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",Ted
02x08,This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.  Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?,Lily
02x08,This is my machine.,Woman
02x08,I should go talk to her.,Marshall
02x08,"No, let me.",Robin
02x08,Blackjack?,Ted
02x08,Yeah.,Marshall
02x08,"Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",Lily
02x08,"Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",Robin
02x08,"Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",Lily
02x08,Nobody's gonna do that.,Robin
02x08,"No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",Lily
02x08,"Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",Robin
02x08,"Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",Marshall
02x08,What?,Lily
02x08,Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?,Ted
02x08,"See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",Lily
02x08,"I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making 5,000.",Captain
02x08,What?,Marshall
02x08,"Deal. 5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",Lily
02x08,I can get us that money.,Barney
02x08,How?,Ted
02x08,Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,Barney
02x08,Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,Ted
02x08,"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called Shing Hasabu Shing. Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",Barney
02x08,"No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",Robin
02x08,"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.",Barney
02x08,"Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.",Ted from 2030
02x08,Do you understand what's happening?,Lily
02x08,Not a clue.,Ted
02x08,Do you think he's winning?,Robin
02x08,I don't even know if he's playing.,Ted
02x08,"Wait, I get it. I understand this game.",Marshall
02x08,"No, you don't.",Ted
02x08,"I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.",Marshall
02x08,"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.",Barney
02x08,Wow. It's beautiful.,Lily
02x08,"Thanks, Barney.",Marshall
02x08,"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!",Barney
02x08,"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?",Ted
02x08,Why can't I do it just a little?,Barney
02x08,Okay. Let's get this started.,Lily
02x08,"Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?",Captain
02x08,"You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.",Captain
02x08,"Yeah, serious is probably good.",Marshall
02x08,"We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...",Captain
02x08,This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.,Ted
02x08,I never said never.,Robin
02x08,"...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you. What was that?",Captain
02x08,What was what?,Marshall
02x08,That little look. You two just shared a look.,Captain
02x08,We don't want to do this.,Lily
02x08,We don't.,Marshall
02x08,Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?,Ted
02x08,After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,Robin
02x08,"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",Barney
02x08,You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,Ted
02x08,"Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",Lily
02x08,"So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",Marshall
02x08,"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
02x08,"I love you, too, Lilypad.",Marshall
02x08,I now pronounce you man and wife.,Captain
02x08,What?!,Lily
02x08,Is that not right?,Captain
02x08,Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,Marshall
02x08,Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.,Captain
02x08,Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us!,Both Marshall and Lily
02x08,"All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.",Captain
02x08,"Oh, whew... That was close.",Lily
02x08,And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City.,Ted from 2030
02x08,"Hey, guys.",Ted 
02x08,Hey... Ted.,Marshall
02x08,Is Robin here?,Lily
02x08,"Man, I hope so.",Marshall
02x09,...learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone.,Future Ted VO
02x09,You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.,Ted
02x09,Some aren't as nice.,Future Ted VO
02x09,"And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...",Robin
02x09,"Oh, I got your total...counting along...",Ted
02x09,And some are just weird.,Future Ted VO
02x09,You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?,Ted
02x09,"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",Robin
02x09,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.",Barney
02x09,Why?,Robin
02x09,"Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",Barney
02x09,"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.",Robin
02x09,"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.",Barney
02x09,"Come on, let's go.",Barney
02x09,"All right, I'm in.",Robin
02x09,To the Willowbrook Mall!,Barney
02x09,To the Willowbrook Mall!,"Ted, Marshall"
02x09,"Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.",Robin
02x09,What? Why not?,Ted
02x09,I just don't feel like going to a mall.,Robin
02x09,We can split a cinnabun.,Lily
02x09,"No, I'm really not gonna go.",Robin
02x09,"Come on, it'll be fun.",Ted
02x09,"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.",Robin
02x09,Why not?,Barney
02x09,I'd rather not say.,Robin
02x09,"Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.",Ted
02x09,Thanks Ted.,Robin
02x09,"So, what's the deal with you and malls?",Ted
02x09,"You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.",Robin
02x09,"Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?",Ted
02x09,No.,Robin
02x09,Dumped in a mall?,Ted
02x09,Ted.,Robin
02x09,Found out you were Canadian at a mall?,Ted
02x09,Let it go.,Robin
02x09,Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.,Ted
02x09,Mauled at the mall?,Ted
02x09,"Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.",Robin
02x09,"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?",Ted
02x09,"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.",Barney
02x09,The 'oh' moment?,Marshall
02x09,"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",Barney
02x09,It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.,Girl  1
02x09,Oh.,Barney
02x09,"I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.",Girl  2
02x09,Oh.,Barney
02x09,I just turned 30.,Girl  3
02x09,Oh.,Barney
02x09,"So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",Barney
02x09,"I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?",Ted
02x09,I now pronounce you man and wife.,Priest
02x09,I love you.,Ted
02x09,I used to be a dude.,Robin
02x09,"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",Lily
02x09,"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",Barney
02x09,It's true. They tell each other everything.,Ted
02x09,I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,Barney
02x09,Try me.,Lily
02x09,Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,Barney
02x09,Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,Lily
02x09,Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,Barney
02x09,"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",Lily
02x09,"OK, Seattle.",Barney
02x09,"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",Lily
02x09,Damn.,Barney
02x09,I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,Marshall
02x09,"Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",Ted
02x09,"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",Marshall
02x09,What happened next?,Lily
02x09,"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",Barney
02x09,You know?,Ted
02x09,"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do prn, wait for it, ography.",Barney
02x09,"Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",Ted
02x09,"I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",Lily
02x09,Hey.,Ted
02x09,What? The walls are thin.,Lily
02x09,That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,Ted
02x09,You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,Marshall
02x09,Married? What does have to do with the mall?,Ted
02x09,"Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",Marshall
02x09,We're not getting married at the mall.,Lily
02x09,Just meet with the guy.,Marshall
02x09,She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,Ted
02x09,"Because she already got married, at the mall.",Marshall
02x09,"No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",Lily
02x09,"Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",Ted
02x09,She's a pretty private person.,Marshall
02x09,Except when she's talking about...,Lily
02x09,A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,Robin
02x09,What do you think of this wedding cake?,Lily
02x09,"Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",Robin
02x09,No.,Lily
02x09,"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",Robin
02x09,They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,Barney
02x09,"So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",Ted
02x09,"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",Marshall
02x09,"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",Barney
02x09,Thank you Barney.,Ted
02x09,'Cause it's prn.,Barney
02x09,I need another beer.,Ted
02x09,Robin is not in prn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,Marshall
02x09,"20,000 says it's prn.",Barney
02x09,"I don't have 20,000.",Marshall
02x09,"Well then, what do you have?",Barney
02x09,Well.,Marshall
02x09,No.,Lily
02x09,I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,Barney
02x09,"Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",Ted
02x09,What the hell's a slap bet?,Lily
02x09,"Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",Marshall
02x09,Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall: You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
02x09,"Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",Lily
02x09,"Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.",Marshall
02x09,"And your tombstone will read, got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.",Marshall
02x09,"All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",Ted
02x09,You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,Lily
02x09,"Yeah, you're right.",Ted
02x09,Husband.,Ted
02x09,There's no 'p' in husband.,Robin
02x09,"Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",Ted
02x09,"Fine, I'll take it back.",Ted
02x09,"Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",Ted
02x09,Huh.,Robin
02x09,"I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",Ted
02x09,"Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.",Robin
02x09,"What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, no, I'm not married.",Robin
02x09,"Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",Robin
02x09,"Just say, no, I'm not married.",Ted
02x09,"I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",Robin
02x09,Oh.,Ted
02x09,You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.,Ted
02x09,Why didn't you get divorced?,Ted
02x09,"He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",Robin
02x09,"Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",Ted
02x09,I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,Robin
02x09,OK.,Ted
02x09,Your hand is monstrous.,Barney
02x09,"Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.",Marshall
02x09,I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,Lily
02x09,How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,Ted
02x09,No I didn't.,Lily
02x09,"Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",Lily
02x09,"Fine, Robin's married.",Ted
02x09,Ha ha ha.,Marshall
02x09,"Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",Lily
02x09,"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",Ted
02x09,I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,Barney
02x09,What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,Ted
02x09,"Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",Lily
02x09,It's serious to me.,Ted
02x09,"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",Marshall
02x09,I can see my hand print on your face.,Marshall
02x09,"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of prn from Canada I have to go through.",Barney
02x09,I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,Marshall
02x09,Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,Barney
02x09,"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch prn.",Lily
02x09,"Canadian prn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go oat of my mind.",Barney
02x09,Hey.,Ted
02x09,"Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",Marshall
02x09,"Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",Ted
02x09,Robin's not married.,Marshall
02x09,"What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",Ted
02x09,I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,Marshall
02x09,There must be some mistake.,Ted
02x09,"I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",Marshall
02x09,"So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",Ted
02x09,"You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",Marshall
02x09,"Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",Ted
02x09,Thanks Ted.,Robin
02x09,"Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",Ted
02x09,I say we just move on.,Robin
02x09,"In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.",Ted
02x09,"Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",Ted
02x09,Sit down or buffet.,Ted
02x09,Um...,Robin
02x09,Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,Ted
02x09,"No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",Robin
02x09,Hm. Band of DJ?,Ted
02x09,"String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",Robin
02x09,How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.,Ted
02x09,Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.,Ted
02x09,Color scheme?,Ted
02x09,Dusty rose and sienna.,Robin
02x09,Husband's name?,Ted
02x09,Um.,Robin
02x09,You were never married.,Ted
02x09,Yes I was.,Robin
02x09,No you weren't.,Ted
02x09,How do you know?,Robin
02x09,I looked it up at the library.,Ted
02x09,What library?,Robin
02x09,The one on 5th.,Ted
02x09,When did you go?,Robin
02x09,Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,Ted
02x09,"I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",Robin
02x09,I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,Ted
02x09,You told Marshall?,Robin
02x09,You lied to me!,Ted
02x09,"See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",Robin
02x09,But it was a fake secret.,Ted
02x09,"Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",Robin
02x09,"Testing me, that's insane.",Ted
02x09,"Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",Robin
02x09,That wasn't a real secret.,Ted
02x09,"Yeah, but it could have been.",Robin
02x09,You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,Ted
02x09,He moved there for business.,Robin
02x09,"You, you got something to say to me?",Barney
02x09,What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.,Marshall
02x09,How could you possibly know that?,Marshall
02x09,"Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",Marshall
02x09,"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.",Marshall
02x09,Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,Barney
02x09,Barney gets three slaps.,Lily
02x09,Three?,Marshall
02x09,One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,Lily
02x09,Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.,Barney
02x09,I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,Ted
02x09,"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",Robin
02x09,So I just got a very interesting phone call.,Barney
02x09,What are you talking about?,Ted
02x09,I know Robin's secret.,Barney
02x09,What?,Robin
02x09,"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.",Barney
02x09,"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",Barney
02x09,Yeah. No I don't.,Ted
02x09,What?,Barney
02x09,Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,Ted
02x09,"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",Barney
02x09,"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",Barney
02x09,"Barney, don't, okay.",Robin
02x09,"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",Barney
02x09,"No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",Ted
02x09,"No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",Robin
02x09,Are you as terrified as I am?,Lily
02x09,I don't wanna get slapped again.,Marshall
02x09,I wanna stress that I was young.,Robin
02x09,Yeah you were.,Barney
02x09,And I didn't know any better.,Robin
02x09,They never do.,Barney
02x09,And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,Robin
02x09,It always does.,Barney
02x09,"Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?",Robin Sparkles
02x09,Oh my God.,Ted
02x09,"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",Barney
02x09,What the hell was that?,Robin
02x09,"I slap bet Marshall that you did prn, so I win.",Ted
02x09,"prn? I wish it was prn, it would be less embarrassing.",Robin
02x09,"I know, how about I sing you a song!",Robin Sparkles
02x09,"Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori.",Robin Sparkles
02x09,I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,Robin
02x09,"Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about.",Robin Sparkles
02x09,This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,Lily
02x09,That's you?,Marshall
02x09,Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,Robin
02x09,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today.",Robin Sparkles
02x09,This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,Marshall
02x09,The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,Robin
02x09,"Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't prn.",Marshall
02x09,And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
02x09,Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,Marshall
02x09,"Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",Ted
02x09,Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend.,Robin Sparkles
02x09,"OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",Lily
02x09,Cool.,"Marshall, Ted"
02x09,Go with the 10 now.,Ted
02x09,"No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",Robin
02x09,"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",Ted
02x09,I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,Barney
02x09,Good call.,Robin
02x09,Horrible call.,Ted
02x09,"Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",Marshall
02x09,Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall,Robin Sparkles
02x09,"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",Lily
02x09,"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.",Barney
02x09,"Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",Ted
02x09,"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",Robin
02x09,Aw.,Barney
02x09,That's one.,Marshall
02x09,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!",Robin Sparkles
02x09,Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.,Barney
02x09,There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me.,Robin Sparkles
02x09,But don't forget the robot.,Robot
02x09,The robot! Hey!,Marshall
02x09,"But, baby, I don't wanna wait.",Robin Sparkles
02x09,"No, she doesn't wanna wait.",Ted
02x09,"I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall ...",Robin Sparkles
02x10,"Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold.",Ted 
02x10,"Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?",Barney
02x10,- Nope.,Ted
02x10,- No.,Robin
02x10,"Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?",Barney
02x10,- Nope.,Ted
02x10,"- No, thanks.","Marshall, lily, Robin"
02x10,"One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?",Barney
02x10,Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.,Marshall
02x10,"It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.",Ted 
02x10,Hi. Have you met me?,Barney
02x10,"Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements.",Ted 
02x10,- No.,Tous
02x10,"Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.",Barney
02x10,- Hey!,Tous
02x10,- You have a brother?,Robin
02x10,"- Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.",Barney
02x10,He's exactly like Barney.,Lily
02x10,That's what I just said.,Barney
02x10,"Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay.",Ted
02x10,"Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.",Robin
02x10,"Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.",Ted
02x10,"What up, New York.",James
02x10,Thanks for the heads up.,Robin
02x10,"How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?",Robin
02x10,"Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.",Ted
02x10,"Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.",Marshall
02x10,"Anyway, James, how have you been?",Lily
02x10,"Awesome, as per yoozh. I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.Legendarier. And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five.",James
02x10,Is gimme five back?,Barney
02x10,"Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.",James
02x10,"Guys, gimme five is back!",Barney
02x10,"Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",Ted
02x10,- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.,Robin
02x10,"- You, too.",James
02x10,"So, I have to ask, there's a story here.",Robin
02x10,Please.,Barney
02x10,"The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years.",Ted 
02x10,"Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?",Mere
02x10,- Coffee?,James
02x10,"- No, James, I ate chocolate ice cream. But I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you. Can't smoke without my coffee.",Mere
02x10,"I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things.",Mere
02x10,Stop asking me! You know what you two are? You're little racists!,Mere
02x10,So what are you guys gonna do tonight?,Ted
02x10,"I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.",Barney
02x10,Okay.,Ted
02x10,"Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?",Marshall
02x10,"Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement. But I will say this: way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have.",James
02x10,And then there was the time they scored the brother sister combo.,Lily
02x10,It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.,Barney
02x10,He was a little bit way into black guys.,James
02x10,"Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist.",Tes 
02x10,Whoa. Your scarf... it is fierce!,James
02x10,Thanks. H  M.,Women
02x10,"What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- ulous. Okay?",James
02x10,And Barney always returned the favor.,Ted 
02x10,"Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?",Barney
02x10,"Oh, my God, I do!",Man
02x10,"Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?",Barney
02x10,"Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.",Barney
02x10,"You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?",James
02x10,- No.,Ted
02x10,- Jammies.,Lily
02x10,Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...I have warm soup belly.,Marshall
02x10,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a hell, yeah?",James
02x10,"- Hell, yeah!",Tous
02x10,"Can I get a hell, yeah?",James
02x10,"- Hell, yeah!",Tous
02x10,Can I get a woo-woo?,James
02x10,- Woo-woo!,Tous
02x10,Go do it for Wyoming!,James
02x10,Yes!,Tous
02x10,Testify!,James
02x10,"So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.",Ted 
02x10,"Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?",Barney
02x10,"Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man.",James
02x10,I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?,Barney
02x10,"Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?",James
02x10,- Let's ride.,Barney
02x10,"- Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!",James
02x10,"- Get off me, you pig!",Women
02x10,"- Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.",Barney
02x10,- What? What?,James
02x10,- What? What?,Barney
02x10,Cool.,James
02x10,Let me know if he bothers you again.,Barney
02x10,Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.,Women
02x10,Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.,Barney
02x10,"Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs.",Ted 
02x10,- Break.,James
02x10,- Boiling hot.,Barney
02x10,Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.,Ted 
02x10,"- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?",James
02x10,Have you met my brother?,Barney
02x10,"Oh, hello. Have a drink.",Barney
02x10,Nice to meet ya.,James
02x10,"Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma.",Ted 
02x10,"I wish I would've worn sneakers. I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied.",James
02x10,I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this.,Lily
02x10,Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.,Robin
02x10,"Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.",Lily
02x10,"Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?",Man
02x10,"Oh, please go sweat on someone else.",Lily
02x10,Poor guy.,Marshall
02x10,Poor guy? Poor my boobs.,Lily
02x10,"Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him.",Marshall
02x10,"Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.",Lily
02x10,"Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end.",Robin
02x10,"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have sx with me. Waa.",Ted
02x10,"Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of.",Marshall
02x10,- Dude.,Ted
02x10,- They're delicious!,Marshall
02x10,Excuse me. Join me in a shot?,Man
02x10,"Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can.",James
02x10,"You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight.",Lily
02x10,"Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are.",Marshall
02x10,"He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?",Ted
02x10,No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.,Robin
02x10,Look at that. He's texting!,Marshall
02x10,"Oh, my God! He is in a couple.",Ted
02x10,This is gonna kll Barney.,Lily
02x10,What's gonna kll me? What's going on?,Barney
02x10,B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?,Marshall
02x10,"No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.",Barney
02x10,"We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.",Ted
02x10,"That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had sx with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had sx with anyone in a bathroom stall.",Barney
02x10,"And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.",Robin
02x10,"No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...",Barney
02x10,"Hey, bro.",James
02x10,Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.,Barney
02x10,Why?,James
02x10,I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.,Barney
02x10,"No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?",James
02x10,I got... Who is this? And the answer better be: I don't remember his name.,Barney
02x10,That is Tom. And he's my fianc.,James
02x10,Hey.,James
02x10,I don't support this.,Barney
02x10,Gay marriage?,James
02x10,"Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!",Barney
02x10,"Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.",James
02x10,"Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.",Barney
02x10,"Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man.",James
02x10,What? No way.,Barney
02x10,"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind.",James
02x10,"Two beers, one shot.",Woman
02x10,"Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.",Barney
02x10,"Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?",Lily
02x10,Yes.,Marshall
02x10,"Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.",Barney
02x10,I don't get manicures.,Ted
02x10,"Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.",Barney
02x10,You get your chest waxed?,Lily
02x10,"You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.",Barney
02x10,"Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.",Marshall
02x10,"No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom.",Barney
02x10,Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.,Marshall
02x10,Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.,Barney
02x10,"Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.",Ted
02x10,"You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.",Barney
02x10,Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?,James
02x10,"What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.",Barney
02x10,"Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.",Marshall
02x10,Hey. You work out?,Man
02x10,I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.,Marshall
02x10,"Well, I try. So you want to dance?",Man
02x10,"You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiance.",Marshall
02x10,"I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...",Man
02x10,"No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.",Marshall
02x10,"No, it isn't.",Lily
02x10,Whatever. How 'bout you?,Man
02x10,"Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.",Ted
02x10,"You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.",Marshall
02x10,"Hey, I really like your sweater.",Man
02x10,"Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.",Robin
02x10,"My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?",Man
02x10,I love this place! Let's dance!,Robin
02x10,- And not be groped!,Lily
02x10,- Whoo! Thank you.,Robin
02x10,- Thank you!,Ted
02x10,- We're hot.,Marshall
02x10,- Totally.,Ted
02x10,"And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!",James
02x10,Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.,Barney
02x10,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.",James
02x10,"And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?",Barney
02x10,"Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.",James
02x10,"Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?",Barney
02x10,Please.,James
02x10,"He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!",Barney
02x10,I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.,Marshall
02x10,"Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.",Ted
02x10,"Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!",Man
02x10,"Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...",Marshall
02x10,"Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?",Man
02x10,"God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?",Ted
02x10,"How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?",Robin
02x10,"That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,",Marshall
02x10,And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!,Ted
02x10,Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?,Lily
02x10,"Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.",Robin
02x10,"James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.",Barney
02x10,Barney.,James
02x10,"So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...",Barney
02x10,"Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.",James
02x10,Wow.- Best of luck to you both.,Charles
02x10,- Thank you.,James
02x10,My number's in here. I'm very discreet.,Charles
02x10,"Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...",James
02x10,"Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?",Barney
02x10,To get laid.,James
02x10,"To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!",Barney
02x10,"- Yes, I do.",James
02x10,- Why?!,Barney
02x10,Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.,James
02x10,What? There's gonna be a baby?,Barney
02x10,Yes. We're adopting.,James
02x10,"Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",Barney
02x10,For the rest of your life.,James
02x10,To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.,Barney
02x10,- Cheers.,Tous
02x10,Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to,Barney
02x10,It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.,Lily
02x10,Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?,Marshall
02x10,"Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.",Ted
02x10,"Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.",Robin
02x10,"All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.",Marshall
02x10,"Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.",Lily
02x10,"Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.",Barney
02x10,- May I?,Barney
02x10,- Yeah.,James
02x10,"Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?",Barney
02x10,I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?,Rosa
02x10,"Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...",Barney
02x11,"Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.",Ted 
02x11,"Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.",Marshall
02x11,"Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.",Ted
02x11,"No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?",Marshall
02x11,Yes.,Lily
02x11,"Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!",Marshall
02x11,"Hey, look. Our old answering machine.",Lily
02x11,"Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.",Ted
02x11,"Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.",Lily
02x11,"Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this",Ted's father
02x11,"Yes, same Clint.",Ted
02x11,"Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.",Ted 
02x11,"But I didn't say Grinch. I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.",Ted 
02x11,"Oh, fudge.",Ted
02x11,But I didn't say fudge.,Ted 
02x11,I'm... a what?,Lily
02x11,"I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.",Ted
02x11,"That was you, Ted.",Lily
02x11,That was Marshall.,Ted
02x11,Marshall left a message for Marshall?,Lily
02x11,"You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...",Ted
02x11,Why would you call me that?,Lily
02x11,It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...,Ted 
02x11,She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.,Marshall
02x11,Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.,Ted
02x11,There's only one of her?,Marshall
02x11,Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?,Ted
02x11,Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.,Marshall
02x11,There you go.,Ted
02x11,"And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.",Ted 
02x11,"Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.",Marshall
02x11,"She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.",Barney
02x11,"Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?",Ted
02x11,"And her art? I'm Lily, I'm an artist. She doesn't even own a beret.",Barney
02x11,"Yeah, and if she's such a great artist, why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?",Marshall
02x11,Yeah!,Ted
02x11,Another round!,Marshall
02x11,I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.,Ted
02x11,The best friend's job is to call me that word?,Lily
02x11,Yeah.,Ted
02x11,"Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
02x11,"Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.",Ted
02x11,Then why don't you say it now?,Barney
02x11,Grinch. You timed that didn't you?,Ted
02x11,Perfectly.,Barney
02x11,"Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?",Robin
02x11,"Oh, yeah. I'm sorry were the first words out of my mouth.",Ted
02x11,"I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.",Ted
02x11,Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?,Lily
02x11,No!,Ted
02x11,Why not?,Lily
02x11,"Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.",Ted
02x11,"Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.",Lily
02x11,Ted Vivian Mosby!,Barney
02x11,That's not my middle name.,Ted
02x11,Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?,Barney
02x11,Like you've never said that word.,Ted
02x11,I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet.,Barney
02x11,Are you sick?,Ted
02x11,Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?,Barney
02x11,"No, I meant do you have a cold?",Ted
02x11,"I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.",Barney
02x11,I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.,Ted
02x11,"Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.",Robin
02x11,"I don't see any mistletoe, but...",Barney
02x11,"Oh! Oh, God!",Woman
02x11,Uh... Bless you would have been nice.,Barney
02x11,You're sick.,Robin
02x11,I'm not sick.,Barney
02x11,You're sick.,Robin
02x11,You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?,Barney
02x11,"Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.",Ted
02x11,You sure this is gonna work?,Robin
02x11,"Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?",Ted
02x11,Totally. Plus free mug.,Robin
02x11,"Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.",Ted 
02x11,She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!,Ted
02x11,That time I did say Grinch.,Ted 
02x11,"All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.",Ted
02x11,"Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?",Robin
02x11,"Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive no cigars in the apartment rule. God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. . High five.",Barney
02x11,Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.,Robin
02x11,"Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it...",Barney
02x11,Lily!,Ted
02x11,"Merry Christmas, assface.",Lily
02x11,"Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?",Ted
02x11,At my apartment.,Lily
02x11,You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?,Ted
02x11,"Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.",Lily
02x11,"Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.",Ted
02x11,Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.,Lily
02x11,"Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...",Ted
02x11,She hung up.,Ted to Robin
02x11,She's just mad. She'll cool down.,Robin
02x11,Lily...,Ted
02x11,Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!,Lily
02x11,Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.,Ted
02x11,Where are you going?,Robin
02x11,"Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.",Ted
02x11,...dary.,Barney
02x11,"Hey, dude, how's the paper going?",Ted
02x11,"Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?",Marshall
02x11,Oh... so magical.,Ted
02x11,"When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?",Marshall
02x11,"Sure does. Look, I gotta go.",Ted
02x11,"Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!",Marshall
02x11,"Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?",Ted
02x11,"Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?",Marshall
02x11,"Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means More Christ to our Spanish friends.",Ted
02x11,"Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.",Marshall
02x11,Right. I gotta go.,Ted
02x11,"Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious?",Marshall
02x11,"You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.",Ted
02x11,"Well, tell Lily I love her.",Marshall
02x11,Right. - Hello?,Ted
02x11,Ted Evelyn Mosby!,His mother
02x11,"Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.",Ted
02x11,I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?,His mother
02x11,"Oh, God, she called you?",Ted
02x11,Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?,His mother
02x11,"No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?",Ted
02x11,"Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?",Clint
02x11,"Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...",Ted
02x11,"Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...",Clint
02x11,"This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous.",Barney
02x11,You just look like a regular guy.,Robin
02x11,Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.,Barney
02x11,And isn't it more comfy?,Robin
02x11,Yes.,Barney
02x11,"Come on, you need eat something.",Robin
02x11,Too weak... to hold... bowl.,Barney
02x11,"Fine, I'll feed you.",Robin
02x11,Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.,Barney
02x11,"No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.",Robin
02x11,But my throat hurts.,Barney
02x11,No!,Robin
02x11,I hate you!,Barney
02x11,Don't leave me.,Barney
02x11,Who is this?,Lily
02x11,Pizza delivery.,Ted
02x11,"Hey, you tricked me.",Lily
02x11,You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?,Ted
02x11,"No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.",Lily
02x11,"Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?",Ted
02x11,"No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.",Lily
02x11,"Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.",Ted
02x11,"Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.",Lily
02x11,I'm not mad at you.,Ted
02x11,"Yes, you are.",Lily
02x11,"I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...",Ted
02x11,I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?,Lily
02x11,"Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!",Ted
02x11,"Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.",Lily
02x11,You were a Grinch!,Ted
02x11,How can you...,Lily
02x11,"Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.",Ted
02x11,"Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.",Lily
02x11,"Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...",Ted
02x11,You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!,Voice
02x11,"That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.",Lily
02x11,Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.,Ted
02x11,"You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.",Robin 
02x11,"Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.",Ted
02x11,"Well, do you want me to go with you?",Robin
02x11,Was that a sincere offer?,Ted
02x11,First tell me your answer.,Robin
02x11,"Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?",Ted
02x11,"You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.",Robin
02x11,You're gonna be a great mom.,Ted
02x11,"Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.",Marshall
02x11,Merry Christmas! What's in the box?,Lily
02x11,Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.,Marshall
02x11,I thought you were writing a paper.,Lily
02x11,"Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...",Marshall
02x11,"It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.",Marshall
02x11,"Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.",Women
02x11,"What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.",Marshall
02x11,"Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...",Women
02x11,"Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?",Marshall
02x11,Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.,Truck driver
02x11,My bad.,Truck driver
02x11,"I'm okay.  Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.",Marshall
02x11,No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.,Truck driver
02x11,"Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?",Marshall
02x11,"Sadly, no.",Truck driver
02x11,"We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.",Marshall
02x11,"Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?",Lily
02x11,It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.,Marshall
02x11,"Wow, that's a great gift.",Ted
02x11,Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.,Marshall
02x11,"Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",Ted
02x11,"When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",Lily
02x11,Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.,Ted
02x11,Dude... how was the concert?,Ted
02x11,I couldn't find the outside.,Marshall
02x11,I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.,Lily
02x11,"Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?",Marshall
02x11,Staten Island.,Lily
02x11,Why?,Marshall
02x11,"Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.",Ted
02x11,Like the gift of God's love?,A kid
02x11,"No, dude, real presents.",Ted
02x11,Uncle Ted got us presents!,Kid
02x11,"That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.",Stacy
02x11,Yay!,Charity
02x11,"Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?",Stacy
02x11,"Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.",Ted
02x11,Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.,Charity
02x11,"That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",Ted
02x11,"Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.",Charity
02x11,"Who is it, Ted?",Stacy
02x11,"Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.",Ted
02x11,"I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.",Lily
02x11,I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.,Ted
02x11,Are you coming home?,Lily
02x11,"Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.",Ted
02x11,"Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?",Lily
02x11,Yes,Ted
02x11,Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?,Lily
02x11,"Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.",Ted
02x11,That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.,Lily
02x11,Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.,Ted
02x11,"Mom, what's a Grinch?",Kid
02x11,"Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...",Both kids
02x11,"Merry Christmas, Marshall.",Marshall
02x12,"Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.",Ted 
02x12,I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
02x12,What?!,Robin
02x12,"Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say I love you. Robin went through the usual stages.",Ted 
02x12,Spider! Spider!,Robin
02x12,I left something in the hallway.,Barney
02x12,Where?,Ted
02x12,Right there.,Robin
02x12,Got it.,Ted
02x12,First there's the moment when you think you think it.,Ted 
02x12,"Whoa, still alive.",Ted
02x12,There's the moment you think you know it.,Ted 
02x12,"Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.",Robin
02x12,Totally worth it.,Ted
02x12,"There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.",Ted 
02x12,"All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?",Ted
02x12,Good night.,Robin
02x12,Good night.,Ted
02x12,"Wait, Ted?",Robin
02x12,Yeah?,Ted
02x12,Good night.,Robin
02x12,"Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie.  Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.",Robin
02x12,That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.,Ted
02x12,Really? You'd do that?,Robin
02x12,Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.,Ted
02x12,"And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.",Ted 
02x12,Ted.,Robin
02x12,Yeah?,Ted
02x12,Falafel.,Robin
02x12,Falafel?,Lily
02x12,Falafel.,Robin
02x12,"Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said falafel?",Lily
02x12,I totally choked.,Robin
02x12,I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?,Lily
02x12,"Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.",Lily
02x12,"Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.",Robin
02x12,Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.,Lily
02x12,"Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.",Barney
02x12,"Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",Marshall
02x12,"No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have sx, you exit when she's in the shower.",Barney
02x12,"So every girl you have sx with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",Robin
02x12,"The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",Barney
02x12,What?,Ted
02x12,"Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, Are we there yet?",Barney
02x12,"So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",Robin
02x12,"Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",Lily
02x12,It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.,Robin
02x12,"Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",Lily
02x12,"Oh, here comes Katie.",Robin
02x12,"Aw, your sister's so cute.",Lily
02x12,"Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.",Robin
02x12,"Hello, Kitty.",Lily
02x12,"Oh, no. No. No. No.",Robin
02x12,"Hey, Robin. How are you?",Katie
02x12,"Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",Robin
02x12,"Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.",Katie
02x12,Looks like hotness runs in the family.,Kyle
02x12,"Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",Robin
02x12,Two whole months.,Katie
02x12,Yeah.,Kyle
02x12,"He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?",Katie
02x12,"My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...",Kyle
02x12,That's cool. This is my friend Lily.,Robin
02x12,Hot.,Kyle
02x12,"You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.",Robin
02x12,"Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.",Katie
02x12,"Uh, no, you're not.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.",Katie
02x12,What? Oh. Oh...,Robin
02x12,I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.,Robin 
02x12,Speech to talk a girl out of having sx.,Marshall
02x12,"Yeah, I don't have any of those.",Ted
02x12,Discouraging premarital sx is against my religion.,Barney
02x12,Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.,Robin
02x12,It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.,Lily
02x12,That's why I need your help.,Robin
02x12,"Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",Ted 
02x12,You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun,Ted
02x12,"When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.",fact number one
02x12,"You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, here we go.",Katie
02x12,Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.,Lily
02x12,"Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",Marshall
02x12,You told them?,Katie
02x12,"Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",Robin
02x12,Totally. You should wait.,All
02x12,sx is fun.,Barney
02x12,See?,Robin
02x12,You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.,Katie
02x12,"Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.",Robin
02x12,"I'll pay you 10,000 for that diary.",Barney
02x12,"Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...",Katie
02x12,"Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.",Robin
02x12,Even Kyle gets to do that.,Marshall
02x12,You have no right to tell me not to do it.,Katie
02x12,"But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.",Robin
02x12,"Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.",Katie
02x12,"You smoke now, too?",Robin
02x12,"Oh, remember cloves?",Lily
02x12,No!,Marshall
02x12,"No Aw, remember cloves? This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sx.",Robin
02x12,"Come on, you were only 16 when you had sx. I was 17.",Ted
02x12,We were 18.,Marshall
02x12,Barney was probably 12.,Ted
02x12,"Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?",Barney
02x12,17.,Ted
02x12,"Dude, me, too.",Barney
02x12,"Barney, you okay?",Lily
02x12,"Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...",Barney
02x12,What camp?,Marshall
02x12,This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.,Barney
02x12,What did you teach?,Robin
02x12,"Uh, dance.",Barney
02x12,Dance?,Ted
02x12,"Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.",Barney
02x12,Sylvia,Barney
02x12,"Yes, Mickey?",Sylvia
02x12,How you call your loverboy?,Barney
02x12,"Come here, loverboy",Sylvia
02x12,And if he doesn't answer,Barney
02x12,"Oh, loverboy",Sylvia
02x12,And if he still doesn't answer?,Barney
02x12,"I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby",Sylvia
02x12,That's Dirty Dancing.,Lily
02x12,It was on last night.,Ted
02x12,"No, it was two nights ago. She's Like the Wind has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!",Marshall
02x12,Do you remember our first time?,Lily
02x12,Yeah. It was back in college.,Marshall
02x12,"Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.",Lily
02x12,Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.,Marshall
02x12,"Yeah, New Year's Eve.",Lily
02x12,Okay.,Marshall
02x12,"Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.",Lily
02x12,That's not a good idea.,Marshall
02x12,Why not?,Lily
02x12,Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.,Marshall
02x12,"Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. : Oops. End of flashback.",Lily
02x12,"Oh, that's adorable.",Robin
02x12,"Yeah, tell her what happened next.",Ted
02x12,That was amazing.,Marshall
02x12,Yeah. Want to do it again?,Lily
02x12,Please don't. End of flashback.,Ted 
02x12,We said we were sorry.,Marshall
02x12,"Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?",Ted
02x12,"You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.",Marshall
02x12,"The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.",Lily
02x12,"Well, mine was terrible.",Robin
02x12,"Wait, I've never heard your story.",Lily
02x12,"Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.",Robin
02x12,Ready?,Brian
02x12,Yeah.,Robin
02x12,This feels so right.,Brian
02x12,"Oh, I know.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, Robin.",Brian
02x12,"Oh, Brian.",Robin
02x12,"Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.",Brian
02x12,I'm so sorry.,Lily
02x12,"Eh, I should've known. There were signs.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.",Brian
02x12,"What?! Oh, my God!",Robin
02x12,"You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had sx, it counts.",Robin
02x12,What do you mean just barely?,Lily
02x12,"Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.",Robin
02x12,Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.,Lily
02x12,"Yes, it does.",Robin
02x12,"No, it doesn't.",Lily
02x12,"Yes, it does.",Marshall
02x12,"No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.",Lily
02x12,"Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?",Barney
02x12,"No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?",Marshall
02x12,Who's Scooter?,Barney
02x12,"My high school boyfriend, who I did not have sx with.",Lily
02x12,"I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, Oh, look at them, they've only had sx with each other.",Marshall
02x12,"No, Marshall, they say,  Oh, look at them, they've only had sx with each other.",Barney
02x12,"But now that's not true anymore, now you've had sx with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.",Marshall
02x12,Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.,Katie
02x12,It's not stupid.,Ted
02x12,I'm going to see Kyle.,Katie
02x12,"Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having sx with someone who's special.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, please, you've had sx with, like, a hundred guys.",Katie
02x12,It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.,Robin
02x12,I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.,Katie
02x12,I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.,Robin
02x12,"Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?",Katie
02x12,"I, um...",Robin
02x12,"Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations.  You're off the hook, okay?",Ted
02x12,Just let me explain.,Robin
02x12,You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.,Ted
02x12,"Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... hm hm hm is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...",Robin
02x12,"Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.",Ted
02x12,"It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.",Robin
02x12,"What, you mean like I did?",Ted
02x12,"No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.",Robin
02x12,Weird... or courageous?,Ted
02x12,"Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?",Robin
02x12,"Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.",Ted
02x12,"No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.",Robin
02x12,"Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.",Ted
02x12,You... What?,Robin
02x12,I take my I love you back.,Ted
02x12,You can't take it back.,Robin
02x12,"Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.",Ted
02x12,"Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump.",Man
02x12,"Marshall, why is this such a big deal?",Lily
02x12,"Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter. Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...",Marshall
02x12,"Okay, Marshall, I get it.",Lily
02x12,It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.,Marshall
02x12,"No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.",Lily
02x12,"Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?",Marshall
02x12,"Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.",Marshall
02x12,You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!,Man
02x12,"Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.",Robin
02x12,"Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.",Katie
02x12,That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.,Robin
02x12,"But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have sx until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.",Ted  
02x12,Dad!,His kids
02x12,"Come on, what really happened?",The girl
02x12,"All right, here's what really happened.",Ted 
02x12,Hey.,Robin
02x12,Hey.,Ted
02x12,She didn't do it.,Robin
02x12,"Hey, that's great! You got through to her.",Ted
02x12,"No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.",Robin
02x12,"Hey, Katie.",Ted
02x12,Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?,Katie
02x12,"No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?",Ted
02x12,"I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.",Katie
02x12,"That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.",Ted
02x12,"Oh, really?",Katie
02x12,"Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.",Ted
02x12,"I love you, Ted.",Molly
02x12,"Oh, I love you, too, Molly.  But I didn't.",Ted
02x12,That was amazing.,Molly
02x12,"Look, I got to go.",Ted
02x12,Where are you going?,Molly
02x12,My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.,Ted
02x12,"Well, will you call me?",Molly
02x12,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.  But I didn't. Molly?",Ted
02x12,Yeah?,Molly
02x12,Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back. But I didn't.,Ted
02x12,"And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have sx. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.",Ted
02x12,So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.,Katie
02x12,"Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?",Robin
02x12,Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.,Katie
02x12,Don't tell Mom.,Robin
02x12,Thanks for doing that.,Robin
02x12,You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.,Ted
02x12,"But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.",Robin
02x12,"Yeah, well...",Ted
02x12,"I love you, Molly.",Ted
02x12,"Oh, I love you, too, Ted.",Molly
02x12,Wow. That was amazing.,Ted
02x12,"Look, I got to go.",Molly
02x12,Wh-Where are you going?,Ted
02x12,"Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome.",Molly
02x12,Will you call me?,Ted
02x12,"Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?",Molly
02x12,Yeah?,Ted
02x12,Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.,Molly
02x12,But she didn't.,Ted
02x12,"Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.",Robin
02x12,"I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.",Ted
02x12,Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.,Robin
02x12,Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.,Ted 
02x12,I am so glad we're finally doing this.,Ted
02x12,What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.,Barney
02x12,"Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.",Marshall
02x12,"Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.",Lily
02x12,"Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had sx with each other.",Marshall
02x12,We've only had sx with each other.,Lily
02x12,They've only had sx with each other.,Barney
02x12,"Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this...  Whoa, whoa! Come on!",Ted
02x12,"So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?",Ted
02x12,"Well, we're usually busy... drinking.",Marshall
02x12,"Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.",Lily
02x12,"That's right, I almost forgot.",Marshall
02x12,"Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...",Barney
02x12,Fast Times at Ridgemont High.,Marshall
02x12,"I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...",Barney
02x12,Risky Business.,Ted
02x12,I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...,Barney
02x12,"That's wr Games, and there's not even a sx scene in it.",Ted
02x12,"All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me Barry the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?",Barney
02x12,Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.,Marshall
02x12,Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.,Barney
02x12,Did anyone put Baby in a corner?,Ted
02x12,"Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.",Barney
02x13,"Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.",Ted 
02x13,That's stupid.,Boy
02x13,There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.,Ted 
02x13,"Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.",Ted
02x13,That's stupid.,Mr. Druthers
02x13,I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.,Ted
02x13,"Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?",Mr Druthers
02x13,"I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it.",Ted 
02x13,Stairs?,Mr Druthers
02x13,"And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.",Ted 
02x13,Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.,Ted
02x13,"Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.",Co-worker
02x13,But suddenly I was a different guy.,Ted 
02x13,"Hey, guys. What's so funny?",Ted
02x13,Nothing. Um... nice shirt.,Co-worker
02x13,Thanks.,Ted
02x13,The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.,Ted 
02x13,"Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.",Ted
02x13,"Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.",Robin
02x13,"Before, I used to be this guy.",Ted 
02x13,"Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.",Ted
02x13,But now...I was this guy.,Ted 
02x13,"Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... Foo Fighters. Get back to work.",Ted
02x13,"But still, the worst part was Druthers.",Ted 
02x13,"Well, I was thinking...",Ted
02x13,"Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.",Robin
02x13,Why would you say that?,Ted
02x13,"Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.",Robin
02x13,I have found that to be true.,Barney
02x13,It's a blessing and a curse really.,Marshall
02x13,"Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.",Lily
02x13,"Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?",Marshall
02x13,Tony.,Ted
02x13,Angela.,Robin
02x13,Mona.,Barney
02x13,Mona?,Robin
02x13,Watch it more closely. Rock your world.,Barney
02x13,"So, what are you gonna do?",Robin
02x13,"Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.",Ted
02x13,Fire him.,MP
02x13,"Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.",Ted
02x13,"Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.",MP
02x13,"Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.",Ted
02x13,"Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.",MP
02x13,You mind if I charge my phone?,Barney
02x13,Knock yourself out.,Ted
02x13,"Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?",Robin
02x13,"Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... : Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.",Robin
02x13,You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.,Ted
02x13,"Oh, my God!",Barney
02x13,What?,Ted
02x13,Do you know about this?,Barney
02x13,No.,Ted
02x13,What is that?,Robin
02x13,"Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.",Barney
02x13,"Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.",Ted
02x13,"I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.",Barney
02x13,"Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.",Robin
02x13,"Oh, come on, Robin.",Barney
02x13,"No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.",Robin
02x13,I know! We're gonna have so much fun!,Barney
02x13,"Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.",Ted
02x13,"Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.",Ted
02x13,Happy birthday to you.,Employees
02x13,"Oh, you had me. You so had me.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"So, you didn't fire him?",Robin
02x13,"I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.",Ted
02x13,"Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.",Barney
02x13,"Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.",Marshall
02x13,"And, uh... I... got you a rose.",Robin
02x13,Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.,Marshall
02x13,"Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.",Barney
02x13,"Oh, wow, a new dart.",Robin
02x13,"Hey, that new dart is great.",Ted
02x13,"I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.",Robin
02x13,"Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art.",Barney
02x13,Nude art.,Ted
02x13,Nude art.,Robin
02x13,"Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?",Marshall
02x13,I knew this day would come.,Lily
02x13,How did you know that?,Marshall
02x13,Because I didn't hide it very well.,Lily
02x13,"So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.",Ted 
02x13,"Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.",Marshall
02x13,"It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.",Lily
02x13,The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!,Marshall
02x13,"No, he's actually a little husky...",Lily
02x13,"Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.",Marshall
02x13,"Okay, just forget it.",Lily
02x13,"Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.",Marshall
02x13,"Well, then you'll have to do it.",Lily
02x13,Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?,Marshall
02x13,We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.,Lily
02x13,We totally saw your butt.,Barney
02x13,This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.,Marshall
02x13,"Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?",Barney
02x13,Where is it?,Marshall
02x13,I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.,Barney
02x13,"You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?",Marshall
02x13,"Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?",Barney
02x13,Field trip!,Ted
02x13,"Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.",Barney
02x13,"Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?",Carl
02x13,"What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!",Marshall
02x13,"Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.",Carl
02x13,I know that Barney gave you that painting.,Marshall
02x13,I don't know what you're talking about.,Carl
02x13,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.",Marshall
02x13,I doubt it.,Carl
02x13,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.",Marshall
02x13,I doubt it.,Carl
02x13,"All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.",Marshall
02x13,I doubt it.,Carl
02x13,This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.,Marshall
02x13,"Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?",Robin
02x13,"Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...",Barney
02x13,"One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.",Ted
02x13,"Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.",Robin
02x13,"You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.",Lily
02x13,"Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.",Barney
02x13,Are you serious?,Lily
02x13,Yeah.,Barney
02x13,"Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?",Lily
02x13,Paint me.,Barney
02x13,What?,Lily
02x13,Paint me.,Barney
02x13,Who's that? Who's out there?,Voice
02x13,"Hammond, is that you?",Ted
02x13,Mosby?,Mr Druthers
02x13,"Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.",Ted 
02x13,"Uh, look, just a second, Ted.",Mr Druters
02x13,"Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?",Ted
02x13,What are you doing?,Mr Druthers
02x13,I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?,Ted
02x13,"Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...",Ted
02x13,Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.,Mr Druthers
02x13,It's okay.,Ted
02x13,What did you want to say to me?,Mr Druthers
02x13,"Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?",Ted
02x13,Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?,Mr Druthers
02x13,"Yeah, I do.",Ted
02x13,Cause I design homes.,Mr Druthers
02x13,I see it.,Ted
02x13,But I don't have a home.,Mr Druthers
02x13,"Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.",Ted
02x13,"Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Uh, no, I don't.",Ted
02x13,"If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Well, that's the dream.",Ted
02x13,"I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Me too, Hammond.",Ted
02x13,Call me Ham.,Mr Druthers
02x13,"No, thanks.",Ted
02x13,Hammy D?,Mr Druthers
02x13,"No, I think just Hammond.",Ted
02x13,"So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.",Robin
02x13,I was this close.,Ted
02x13,"Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.",Ted 
02x13,"Oh honey, you're awake?",Lily
02x13,I'm awake. Is everything okay?,Marshall
02x13,Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?,Lily
02x13,"Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.",Marshall
02x13,"Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?",Lily
02x13,"It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.",Marshall
02x13,"Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?",Lily
02x13,Loch Ness?,Marshall
02x13,"Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...",Lily
02x13,"Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.",Marshall
02x13,Maybe we can.,Lily
02x13,Paint me.,Barney
02x13,"Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?",Lily
02x13,"We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.",Barney
02x13,"Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.",Lily
02x13,"Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.",Barney
02x13,Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.,Lily
02x13,"I'll give you 5,000.",Barney
02x13,We're going to Loch Ness!,Marshall
02x13,Yeah!,Lily
02x13,That cabby would not shut up.,Ted
02x13,"Yeah, we should call him a gabby.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"I think it, you say it.",Ted
02x13,"Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.",Ted
02x13,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.",Mr Druthers
02x13,What?,Ted
02x13,"You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...",Mr Druthers
02x13,Can I see you for one second?,Ted
02x13,"Ooh, I'm in trouble now.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.",Ted
02x13,We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.,Mr Druthers
02x13,"What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my",Ted
02x13,"Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Okay, let's get this over with.",Lily
02x13,"Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.",Barney
02x13,Thank you.,Lily
02x13,"I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, There's stands Barnabus Stinson. He was wise... and strong.",Barney
02x13,I don't think your sword will fit.,Lily
02x13,I get that a lot.,Barney
02x13,"And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the 5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.",Ted 
02x13,This isn't right. This isn't right at all.,Marshall
02x13,"Finally, he could take it no more.",Ted 
02x13,Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!,Lily
02x13,Paint faster!,Barney
02x13,"Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.",Lily
02x13,"Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...",Barney
02x13,"Oh, just drop them!",Lily
02x13,All right.,Barney
02x13,"No! No, this is not right!",Marshall
02x13,We had a deal!,Barney
02x13,"Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!",Marshall
02x13,You...!,Barney
02x13,It's over! . It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.,Marshall
02x13,"Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.",Barney
02x13,We accept.,Marshall
02x13,"You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",Barney
02x13,And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.,Ted 
02x13,"Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...",Ted
02x13,Looking for Hammond Druthers.,Man
02x13,"Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.",Mr Druthers
02x13,These are divorce papers. You've been served.,Man
02x13,"Oh, God.",Ted
02x13,She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.,Mr Druthers
02x13,"There is no easy way to say this, but...",Ted
02x13,"She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...",Ted
02x13,Happy birthday to you...,Men 
02x13,You've got to be kidding me!,Ted
02x13,"Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Wait, his birthday was yesterday!",Ted
02x13,"Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...",Man
02x13,"No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?",Ted
02x13,"Oh, God...",Mr Druthers
02x13,"Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired!  In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.",Ted
02x13,"And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career.",Ted 
02x13,"Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.",Man
02x13,"Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.",Lily
02x13,"Thank you very much, Lily.",Barney
02x13,"Marshall, do you have the money?",Lily
02x13,Yeah.,Marshall
02x13,Let's get out of here!,Lily
02x13,A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme.,Barney
02x14,"Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget.",Ted 
02x14,"Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.",Ted
02x14,"Problem. Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.",Barney
02x14,"And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.",Ted
02x14,"If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that.",Marshall
02x14,Here's the info for tomorrow night.,The waitress
02x14,What's tomorrow night?,Ted
02x14,"Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died.",The waitress
02x14,"Oh, my God.",Lily
02x14,"Oh, my gosh.",Marshall
02x14,"The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers.",The waitress
02x14,Stay strong. We're so sorry.,All
02x14,Who was Mark?,Ted
02x14,No idea.,Marshall
02x14,Not a clue.,Barney
02x14,"Well, I guess we should go, right?",Lily
02x14,"Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.",Marshall
02x14,"Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.",Ted
02x14,Mark.,Lily
02x14,"Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl : Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless bstrd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?",Ted
02x14,Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.,All
02x14,"Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt...",Ted
02x14,Mark.,Lily
02x14,"Mark, and start watching only an hour late.",Ted
02x14,"Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.",Marshall
02x14,"Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the",Ted
02x14,Amen.,Marshall
02x14,Amen.,Ted
02x14,We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.,Lily
02x14,"Yeah, they're the best part.",Robin
02x14,"Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?",Ted
02x14,"Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.",Robin
02x14,"Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.",Barney
02x14,So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?,Ted
02x14,"Have I taught you nothing, Ted?",Barney
02x14,Virtually.,Ted
02x14,Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.,Barney
02x14,Sartorial?,Ted
02x14,"Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade. Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!",Barney
02x14,Such a waste.,Barney
02x14,I know. He was so young.,Lily
02x14,"A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce  Gabbana. It must be so frightened.",Barney
02x14,"This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00.",Robin
02x14,"And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.",Carl
02x14,Dibs on the one Carl just told.,Marshall
02x14,"Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.",Robin
02x14,"Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.",Lily
02x14,"Oh, thank God! I'll find out.",Barney
02x14,"No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.",Ted
02x14,"Second down, everyone drink.",Ted
02x14,"Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens.",Barney
02x14,"Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things.",Marshall
02x14,"I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!",Ted
02x14,"Calm down, buddy.",Marshall
02x14,"Oh, commercials!",Lily
02x14,Everyone drink!,Ted
02x14,"God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?",Ted
02x14,"Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.",Marshall
02x14,I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.,Barney
02x14,"Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.",Marshall
02x14,Fine.,Barney
02x14,"See, there you go, he made it. You win.",Marshall
02x14,"Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?",Barney
02x14,"Nothing, it's the halftime show.",Marshall
02x14,"Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?",Lily
02x14,"God, how cool is Robin?",Ted
02x14,I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.,Marshall
02x14,"Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.",Barney
02x14,Are you crazy? Maybe for 50.,Marshall
02x14,"50?! What fun is 50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, 50.",Barney
02x14,"Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.",Robin
02x14,"Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.",Ted
02x14,That's impossible.,Barney
02x14,"I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?",Ted
02x14,I'm in.,Lily
02x14,I'm in.,Robin
02x14,I'm in.,Marshall
02x14,"What the hell, I'm in. High five!",Barney
02x14,"Dude, we're at a wake.",Ted
02x14,Sorry. Solemn low five.,Barney
02x14,"As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.",Ted 
02x14,"Hey, take this key and swallow it.",Barney
02x14,What? No.,Ted
02x14,"Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.",Barney
02x14,"Lots more, no.",Ted
02x14,"I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.",Barney
02x14,Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.,Ted
02x14,"The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.",Ted 
02x14,"But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.",Robin
02x14,Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.,Kevin
02x14,"You're right, Kevin.",Man
02x14,"Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update.",Kevin
02x14,No!,Robin
02x14,What?,Kevin
02x14,No.,Robin
02x14,"But it's, uh, time for Sports.",Kevin
02x14,"No, it's not. It's time for Weather.",Robin
02x14,"We, we just did Weather.",Kevin
02x14,"Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?",Robin
02x14,"Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin.",Lou
02x14,"Okay, now it's time for Sports.",Kevin
02x14,No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.,Robin
02x14,"Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid.",Kevin
02x14,"Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl.",Sid
02x14,"Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.",Ted 
02x14,And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.,Lily
02x14,"Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like Monster.",Marshall
02x14,"Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.",Lily
02x14,Hey. I'm Doug.,Doug
02x14,"Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.",Marshall
02x14,Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?,Doug
02x14,"Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.",Marshall
02x14,I know who won.,Doug
02x14,"Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.",Marshall
02x14,How badly do you not want to know?,Doug
02x14,Excuse me?,Marshall
02x14,Ten bucks.,Doug
02x14,Are you serious?,Marshall
02x14,Just went up to eight.,Doug
02x14,"Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.",Barney
02x14,Not until game time.,Ted
02x14,Where are you going?,Barney
02x14,Pick up the hot wings.,Ted
02x14,What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.,Barney
02x14,"Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.",Ted
02x14,"Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!",Ted
02x14,"And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin.",Sid
02x14,We'll be right back.,Kevin
02x14,And we're clear.,Man
02x14,I'm sorry.,Robin
02x14,"Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?",Woman
02x14,"I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.",Robin
02x14,That is crazy. I can't do that.,Woman
02x14,My friend Mark passed away this week.,Robin
02x14,"Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.",Woman
02x14,Back in five... four... three...,Man
02x14,It's just so hard.,Robin
02x14,Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked!  No...!,Ted
02x14,"And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.",Ted 
02x14,Where's the dipping sauce?,Ted
02x14,"The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?",Doug
02x14,"Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?",Marshall
02x14,I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.,Doug
02x14,"Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.",Marshall
02x14,"Okay, now who did this?",Lily
02x14,I did.,Marshall
02x14,Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?,Doug
02x14,"Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...",Lily
02x14,"When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.",Doug
02x14,Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.,Lily
02x14,"And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.",Robin
02x14,Hey. Hey.,Doug
02x14,I'm not talking to you.,Marshall
02x14,"Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath.",Doug
02x14,I'm not holding my breath.,Marshall
02x14,The winning team was the...  Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...,Doug
02x14,"And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...",Ted 
02x14,"Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.",Marshall
02x14,"No, I didn't.",Doug
02x14,"Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone...",Marshall
02x14,"Okay, okay. You win.",Doug
02x14,I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.,Marshall
02x14,"Sir, who won the Super Bowl?",Barney
02x14,Sorry. I missed the game.,Man
02x14,You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!,Barney
02x14,I... don't really follow sports.,Man 2
02x14,"Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.",Barney
02x14,"Yeah, I get that a lot.",Emmitt Smith
02x14,"You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?",Barney
02x14,"The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.",Emmitt Smith
02x14,"But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!",Barney
02x14,"Dance, my friend. Dance.",Emmitt Smith
02x14,No...!,Barney
02x14,Hello! It's me again.,Ted
02x14,Oh! I didn't recognize you.,Barman
02x14,"Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.",Ted
02x14,"It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong.",Ted 
02x14,And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.,Robin
02x14,"Hey, buddy.",Man 1
02x14,"Hey, dude, look out.",Man 2
02x14,And in honor of yesterday's big win...,Trish Sanchez
02x14,"Hey, buddy, look out.",Man 1
02x14,"Dude, watch out!",Man 2
02x14,...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...,Trish Sanchez
02x14,No...!,Robin
02x14,No...!,Marshall 
02x14,No...!,Barney
02x14,Yes...!,Ted
02x14,"Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?",Ted
02x14,Mission accomplished.,Robin
02x14,Didn't find out.,Lily
02x14,"Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready.  Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.",Ted
02x14,"Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.",Ted
02x14,"Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.",Ted
02x14,"Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.",Lily
02x14,Way to blow it.,Robin
02x14,"Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.",Marshall
02x14,There's no point in even watching the game.,Ted
02x14,"Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.",Lily
02x14,Wings are still good.,Marshall
02x14,Beer still works.,Robin
02x14,"Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money.",Ted
02x14,"Hey, so check this out: I got extorted by a five-year-old today.",Marshall
02x14,I almost got fired today.,Robin
02x14,I met Emmitt Smith today.,Barney
02x14,"Ooh, you go first.",Lily
02x14,I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.,Ted
02x14,"Yeah, go ahead, Barney.",Lily
02x14,"Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...",Barney
02x14,"And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?",Ted 
02x14,"I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?",Barney
02x14,"50-50, give or take.",Ted
02x14,"Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...",Barney
02x15,"Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago.",Ted 
02x15,That security guard was a little bit handsy.,Robin
02x15,"That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.",Ted
02x15,Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.,Ted 
02x15,"Hi, wait, two more.",Ted
02x15,"Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.",Woman
02x15,"Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.",Ted
02x15,"Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.",Woman
02x15,"Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.",Ted
02x15,"I'm sorry, sir.",Woman
02x15,"His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.",Robin
02x15,"Please, I have to be on this flight.",Ted
02x15,I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.,Woman
02x15,Thanks.,Ted
02x15,Your uniforms are pretty.,Robin
02x15,"Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.",Woman
02x15,"Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.",Ted
02x15,"Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.",Woman
02x15,"Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.",Ted
02x15,"Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.",Rubin
02x15,"You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel.  Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?",Woman
02x15,That thing better have call waiting.,Ted
02x15,Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?,Robin
02x15,It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?,Ted
02x15,"Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?",Robin
02x15,She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.,Ted 
02x15,"Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?",Robin
02x15,"Oh, man, it kills.",Marshall
02x15,"You want some aspirin, baby?",Lily
02x15,You know I don't believe in pain killers.,Marshall
02x15,"Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole Unbreakable theory.",Ted
02x15,Marshall used to think he was indestructible.,Lily
02x15,"Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.",Marshall
02x15,There was a really heavy door. He opened it.,Ted
02x15,On one pull.,Marshall
02x15,"Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.",Robin
02x15,"Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.",Marshall
02x15,Training for a marathon.,Barney
02x15,What?,Marshall
02x15,You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.,Barney
02x15,"You're kidding, right?",Marshall
02x15,Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.,Barney
02x15,"So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",Marshall
02x15,Absolutely.,Barney
02x15,"Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.",Robin
02x15,"Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.",Ted
02x15,"Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.",Barney
02x15,"50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it 10,000.",Barney
02x15,You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.,Marshall
02x15,"Fine, then no bet. Okay, 50.",Barney
02x15,"The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.",Ted 
02x15,"Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.",Marshall
02x15,"Ooh, he's starting!",Robin
02x15,This ought to be good. Wow.  He's already passing the second checkpoint.,Marshall
02x15,"This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.",Lily
02x15,Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.,Robin
02x15,"He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.",Marshall
02x15,"Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang Hungry Like the Wolf, and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?",Ted
02x15,"Well, it looks like, Barney should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.",Marshall
02x15,It's really him.,Marshall
02x15,"Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",Lily
02x15,"What up, non-finishers?",Barney
02x15,"Wow. Very impressive, Barney.",Ted
02x15,"Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.",Barney
02x15,I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.,Lily
02x15,So where's my 50 bucks?,Barney
02x15,"All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",Marshall
02x15,"Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.",Barney
02x15,"Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",Marshall
02x15,Wow. You know I really should check out this subway. Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.,Barney
02x15,You're dating a girl from New Jersey?,Ted
02x15,No.,Barney
02x15,So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.,Ted 
02x15,Hello?,Ted
02x15,"Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",Barney
02x15,"What, what are you talking about?",Ted
02x15,"I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.",Barney
02x15,"Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.",Barney
02x15,86th street.,Voice
02x15,"My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",Barney
02x15,Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.,Ted
02x15,Best 50 bucks I ever spent.,Marshall
02x15,"Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",Barney
02x15,All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.,Ted
02x15,"Ted, Ted.",Barney
02x15,"Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?",Woman
02x15,I'm sorry. I can't.,Barney
02x15,Douche.,Old lady
02x15,Barney?!,Ted
02x15,Ted!,Barney
02x15,Hey!,Policeman
02x15,No...!,Barney
02x15,"See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",Robin
02x15,You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.,Ted
02x15,So I was able to get you two seats.,Woman
02x15,Really? That's great!,Ted
02x15,"No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?",Woman
02x15,"Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?",Ted
02x15,I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.,Woman
02x15,"What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.",Ted
02x15,"Well, he never even called you back?",Robin
02x15,"Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.",Woman
02x15,"It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.",Ted 
02x15,What was the name of the airline again?,Robin
02x15,I think it was something like Flights R' Us.,Ted
02x15,Was the R backwards?,Robin
02x15,"God, I hope not.",Ted
02x15,Geez.,Robin
02x15,Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.,Ted
02x15,"If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",Robin
02x15,"You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",Ted
02x15,"Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",Robin
02x15,"For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",Ted 
02x15,My pants are starting to feel a little tight.,Marshall
02x15,"Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",Lily
02x15,I cannot allow this.,Marshall
02x15,What?,Lily
02x15,I am going to run the New York City Marathon.,Marshall
02x15,"It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice. Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",Lily
02x15,"Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",Marshall
02x15,Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.,Lily
02x15,This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!,Marshall
02x15,"Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.",Lily
02x15,"Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.",Marshall
02x15,"Marshall? Oh, my God!",Robin
02x15,"So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time!  And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",Ted
02x15,That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on,Robin
02x15,"Hey, what's going on here?",Robin
02x15,"Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.",Ted
02x15,"Yeah, but for what?",Robin
02x15,"I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90 off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.",Ted
02x15,"Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?",Robin
02x15,We have to camp out.,Lily
02x15,Are you serious?,Robin
02x15,"You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",Lily
02x15,I can't go. I've got this thing.,Barney
02x15,What thing?,Lily
02x15,A pen1s.,Barney
02x15,This is the place.,Robin
02x15,"Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?",Lily
02x15,You said wang.,Robin
02x15,"Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.",Lily
02x15,"You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.",Robin
02x15,"Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.",Lily
02x15,That's kind of annoying.,Robin
02x15,"Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.  I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",Lily
02x15,"It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",Robin
02x15,"If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.",Lily
02x15,I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.,Robin
02x15,"Morning, ladies.",Man
02x15,It's him. It's the car guy!,Lily
02x15,Get out of here!,Robin
02x15,"The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...",Ted 
02x15,Nobody does it better than you.,Marshall
02x15,"Marshall?! Oh, my God!",Robin
02x15,"So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.",Robin
02x15,"Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.",Ted
02x15,"Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.",Man
02x15,"Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.",Robin
02x15,You did that story on the giant pizzas?,Man
02x15,Would you check to see if you have any more seats?,Ted
02x15,"One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?",Man
02x15,Robin...,Ted
02x15,"One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",Robin
02x15,I knew it!,Man
02x15,"God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",Robin
02x15,"Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.",Man
02x15,Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?,Ted
02x15,I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.,Man
02x15,"Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?",Robin
02x15,No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?,Ted
02x15,1939?! This penny's from 1939!  A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World wr II?,Ted
02x15,"Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.",Robin
02x15,"Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.",Ted
02x15,"No, it's not.",Robin
02x15,"Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.",Ted
02x15,And that's exactly what I did.,Ted
02x15,You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.,Robin
02x15,"Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only 1.49. 1984.",Ted
02x15,"Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.",Robin
02x15,How dare you.,Ted
02x15,"Hey, what's going on?",Robin
02x15,I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.,Ted
02x15,"Yeah, but for what?",Robin
02x15,"It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",Ted
02x15,"And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",Robin
02x15,"Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",Ted
02x15,And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.,Robin
02x15,"I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",Ted
02x15,"Uh, sir?",Man
02x15,"Oh, please tell me you have some good news.",Ted
02x15,"Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.",Man
02x15,"All, right, well, thanks for trying.",Robin
02x15,"I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.",Ted
02x15,"Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.",Robin
02x15,"But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.",Ted 
02x16,"Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.",Ted 
02x16,How about Mimi's?,Robin
02x16,"Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.",Ted
02x16,"Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.",Robin
02x16,"Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?",Ted
02x16,We did?,Robin
02x16,"Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, You two should get married! You two should get married!",Ted
02x16,It's also important to know when to stop talking.,Ted 
02x16,Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?,Ted
02x16,Because it wasn't me.,Robin
02x16,"Oh, right! It was... my sister.",Ted
02x16,"You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.",Ted 
02x16,"Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.",Ted
02x16,I've never seen Van Helsing.,Robin
02x16,That's right. I saw it with my sister.,Ted
02x16,My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.,Robin
02x16,"Oh, it's so romantic.",Ted
02x16,When were you in Maui?,Robin
02x16,I... went... with my sister.,Ted
02x16,"With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.",Robin
02x16,You're right. We should just be honest.,Ted
02x16,Totally.,Robin
02x16,"See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.",Ted
02x16,I don't want to hear that.,Robin
02x16,What? You said...,Ted
02x16,"God, that is so insensitive.",Robin
02x16,Remember honesty...?,Ted
02x16,You're a jerk!,Robin
02x16,"Well, you're...confusing.",Ted
02x16,"Okay, so you have to have sx with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!",Marshall
02x16,I don't know. Is she fat?,Barney
02x16,"Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.",Marshall
02x16,Hot off the presses!,Lily
02x16,I-I don't take flyers.,Barney
02x16,You took one two seconds before you walked in here.,Marshall
02x16,That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?,Barney
02x16,Fine. It's a flyer from my play.,Lily
02x16,"Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...",Barney
02x16,"Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.",Marshall
02x16,"Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.",Barney
02x16,"Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.",Ted
02x16,"Yes, you should break up.",Barney
02x16,"So, earlier tonight...",Ted
02x16,"Mm, we should get down to the bar.",Robin
02x16,"I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.",Ted
02x16,"Oh, God, why is this part of the story?",Barney
02x16,We're getting to it.,Ted
02x16,"Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?",Robin
02x16,"Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.",Ted
02x16,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!",Lily
02x16,What's wrong with her?,Barney
02x16,She hates that word.,Marshall
02x16,"What word, moist?",Barney
02x16,"No! Seriously, stop!",Lily
02x16,"So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...",Robin
02x16,"Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.",Robin
02x16,What are you talking about? It's yours.,Ted
02x16,"No, it's not.",Robin
02x16,"Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.",Ted
02x16,"No, it's not.",Lily
02x16,"Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?",Robin
02x16,"Um, my sister's.",Ted
02x16,"So, in other words, some girl you went out with.",Robin
02x16,Um... I love you.,Ted
02x16,Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?,Robin
02x16,It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.,Lily
02x16,I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.,Marshall
02x16,"Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.",Ted
02x16,Why is that still in your apartment?,Robin
02x16,I don't know. I just never threw it out.,Ted
02x16,"Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?",Robin
02x16,"Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.",Ted
02x16,Not three dollars! Try 14.,Robin
02x16,Why is this such a big deal?,Ted
02x16,Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!,Robin
02x16,"Whoa, she wasn't a whore.",Ted
02x16,"Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?",Robin
02x16,"Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...",Ted
02x16,"No. No! No! Oh, Ted!",Robin
02x16,"Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?",Lily
02x16,"Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.",Robin
02x16,"Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.",Ted
02x16,So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.,Robin
02x16,"Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",Ted
02x16,"Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.",Barney
02x16,"Nice, right?",Marshall
02x16,I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old,Robin
02x16,Yes!,Lily
02x16,I vote they can stay. Check out the jackass in the parachute pants is a good icebreaker.,Barney
02x16,Ted. Ted? Ted?,Marshall
02x16,"Sorry, buddy, it's a no for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.",Ted
02x16,They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.,Marshall
02x16,"Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",Barney
02x16,"All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.",Lily
02x16,"Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.",Ted
02x16,"Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.",Marshall
02x16,"Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.",Robin
02x16,I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?,Ex-girlfriend 1
02x16,He calls you sweetie pie? He called me sweetie pie.,Ex-girlfriend 2
02x16,"I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.",Ex-girlfriend 3
02x16,Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!,Ted
02x16,"Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.",Robin
02x16,You're creepy and gross.,Ted
02x16,Your mom's creepy and gross.,Robin
02x16,"Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.",Lily
02x16,I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.,Marshall
02x16,"All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",Ted
02x16,I side with Robin.,Barney
02x16,What?,Ted
02x16,"Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",Barney
02x16,"Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?",Robin
02x16,"Just stop, sweetie.",Ted
02x16,"So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.",Ted 
02x16,"Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?",Robin
02x16,"From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.",Barney
02x16,Where do you guys want to sit?,Ted
02x16,I know where I don't want to sit.,Barney
02x16,"Guys, four together!",Marshall 
02x16,I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.,Barney
02x16,Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.,Robin
02x16,No? Okay.,Barney
02x16,I... am... Rage!,Man 1
02x16,I... am Greed.,Woman
02x16,I am Rage... Envy!,Lily
02x16,I am outta here.,Barney
02x16,"No, you're not. You have to stay.",Marshall
02x16,This is the face of Consumerism!,Lily
02x16,"Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.",Marshall
02x16,"Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!",Man 2
02x16,"Oh, baby, that was wonderful!",Marshall
02x16,"Totally, I had no idea Greed was the kller.",Ted
02x16,"And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, Now we are really cookin'!",Robin
02x16,"Wow, Lily, that sucked!",Barney
02x16,Barney!,Marshall
02x16,"What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",Barney
02x16,"No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.",Lily
02x16,"Yeah, if you're a Smurf.",Barney
02x16,"You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.",Lily
02x16,"Oh, really? You would?",Barney
02x16,Yes.,Lily
02x16,"Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",Barney
02x16,We'll be starting our QA with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out,Man
02x16,Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?,Robin
02x16,I know. He can be really insensitive.,Ted
02x16,"It was pretty bad, though.",Robin
02x16,"Oh, my God, it was so bad.",Ted
02x16,"Oh, my God, you've been robbed!",Robin
02x16,Nope.,Ted
02x16,All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?,Robin
02x16,What can I say? Papa gets swag.,Ted
02x16,And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...,Ted 
02x16,"You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.",Ted
02x16,"Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have sx with you when I'm really tired.",Robin
02x16,"Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?",Ted
02x16,"Nope. Well, except for my dogs.",Robin
02x16,"So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.",Ted
02x16,"What's your point, Ted?",Robin
02x16,"Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?",Ted
02x16,"What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?",Robin
02x16,I do now.,Ted
02x16,That's ridiculous.,Robin
02x16,"I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.",Ted
02x16,You said everything.,Ted
02x16,But not living things.,Robin
02x16,"Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.",Ted
02x16,Things with a heartbeat can stay.,Robin
02x16,Enjoying this?,Ted
02x16,"Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.",Robin
02x16,Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.,Ted
02x16,"Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?",Robin
02x16,Guess what position we did it in.,Man
02x16,"Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.",Ted
02x16,"Um, no.",Robin
02x16,"Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.",Ted
02x16,She's not getting rid of the dogs.,Marshall
02x16,What's the matter with you?,Lily
02x16,Even I wouldn't do that.,Barney
02x16,Yes!,Robin
02x16,"You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.",Lily
02x16,I miss Jebediah.,Marshall
02x16,"Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",Barney
02x16,Very funny.,Lily
02x16,"Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.",Barney
02x16,"Oh, we'll be there.",Lily
02x16,"Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...",Barney
02x16,Never.,Lily
02x16,"Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.",Barney
02x16,I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.,Robin
02x16,I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.,Ted
02x16,So we're-we're okay?,Robin
02x16,"Yeah, we're great.",Ted
02x16,"And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.",Ted 
02x16,"Oh, yeah, that's the spot.",Man
02x16,"Dude, I gotta pee.",Man
02x16,I gotta go.,Ted
02x16,"Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?",Lily
02x16,"Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.",Robin
02x16,You're gonna kll your dogs?!,Lily
02x16,"No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.",Robin
02x16,"Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.",Lily
02x16,"Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.",Robin
02x16,"Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.",Lily
02x16,They? What do you mean by they?,Robin
02x16,"Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!",Lily
02x16,"Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...",Marshall
02x16,"I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.",Lily
02x16,Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.,Barney
02x16,That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.,Ted 
02x16,Moist.,Barney
02x16,And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.,Ted 
02x16,I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.,Barney
02x16,I never get picked for audience participation.,Marshall
02x16,And then it just got weird.,Ted 
02x16,"Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",Barney
02x16,And when that didn't work...,Ted 
02x16,"Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",Lily
02x16,"Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?",Barney
02x16,"No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.",Lily
02x16,"Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting",Barney
02x16,"Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.",Lily
02x16,Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.,Barney
02x16,"Yeah, well, anyway.",Lily
02x16,"Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?",Barney
02x16,"It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.",Barney
02x16,"So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.",Ted 
02x16,Hey.,Robin
02x16,Where've you been? I called you earlier.,Ted
02x16,I gave my dogs away to my aunt.,Robin
02x16,You what?,Ted
02x16,"Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.",Robin
02x16,"Wow. Oh, man.",Ted
02x16,Can we go inside?,Robin
02x16,"Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.",Ted
02x16,Why? What's going on inside?,Robin
02x16,"Um, the floors are gone.",Ted
02x16,What?,Robin
02x16,"Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.",Ted
02x16,I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!,Ted
02x16,You said you threw all that stuff away!,Robin
02x16,"Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.",Ted 
02x16,We're really doing this?,Robin
02x16,Yeah.,Ted
02x16,We're moving in together!,Ted and Robin
02x16,"The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.",Barney
02x16,That's two.,Marshall
02x17,This is awesome.,Ted
02x17,"I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.",Marshall
02x17,"Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.",Ted
02x17,"Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.",Marshall
02x17,"Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.",Ted
02x17,What are you talking about?,Marshal
02x17,"Whoa, pothole. The car stops.",Ted
02x17,"What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!",Marshall
02x17,Is it cool if I still light these?,Ted
02x17,"Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, This is who I really am. Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.",Ted 
02x17,Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.,Ted
02x17,Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.,Marshall
02x17,"Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.",Ted
02x17,Surprise.,Lily
02x17,"We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.",Robin
02x17,We insisted.,Barney
02x17,Terrific.,Ted
02x17,How's the Fiero?,Barney
02x17,She's still in triage.,Marshall
02x17,She? I thought it was your little boy.,Ted
02x17,"Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a trnny car.",Lily
02x17,How long have you had her... slash him?,Robin
02x17,My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.,Marshall
02x17,"Oh, how nice of them.",Robin
02x17,Not really.,Marshall
02x17,Congratulations.,Brother 1
02x17,The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.,Brother 2
02x17,Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only 4.50 has come out.,Marshall
02x17,Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.,Brother 1
02x17,That's it?,Marshall
02x17,"Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear.",Brother 2
02x17,Agreed. Totally agreed.,Marshall
02x17,You're naked.,Man
02x17,I'm aware of that.,Marshall
02x17,You have 50 cents?,Man
02x17,"No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?",Marshall
02x17,"Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.",Man
02x17,"And that is the origin of Marshall's insane no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries rule.",Ted
02x17,It is not insane.,Marshall
02x17,Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.,Lily
02x17,"Well, I'm trying, but it's...",Barney
02x17,"Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?",Lily
02x17,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.",Barney
02x17,No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.,Lily
02x17,"Aw, nerts.",Barney
02x17,The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?,Ted
02x17,"Ah, the Fiero-asco.",Marshall
02x17,"Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.",Ted
02x17,What's the 100K fiasco?,Robin
02x17,The Fiero-asco?,Marshall
02x17,"It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.",Ted
02x17,I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.,Marshall
02x17,And Marshall was a total slob.,Ted
02x17,"Hey  I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",Marshall
02x17,"All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...",Ted
02x17,"All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.",Marshall
02x17,She'd be so bummed if I left early.,Ted
02x17,"It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.",Ted
02x17,I hear you.,Marshall
02x17,So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious,Ted
02x17,"Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?",Marshall
02x17,The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.,Ted
02x17,So... this song.,Ted
02x17,"Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.",Marshall
02x17,Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.,Ted
02x17,Don't worry. It comes around again.,Marshall
02x17,What do you mean?,Ted
02x17,"Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door...",Ted and Marshall singing
02x17,"Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.",Marshall
02x17,"That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?",Ted
02x17,What?,Marshall
02x17,"Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, Zitch dog. I'm pretty good, so...",Ted
02x17,Zitch dog.,Marshall
02x17,"Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.",Ted
02x17,Zitch dog.,Marshall
02x17,Zitch dog. Damn it!,Ted
02x17,Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...,Ted
02x17,12-nothing.,Marshall
02x17,Marshall. Marshall.,Ted
02x17,"Zitch dog, blue Suburban.",Marshall
02x17,Damn it!,Ted
02x17,18-nothing.,Marshall
02x17,"Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.",Ted 
02x17,Where the hell are we?!,Marshall
02x17,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.",Marshall
02x17,Really? Seems impossible.,Barney
02x17,"Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.",Ted
02x17,Doesn't seem like a smart idea.,Marshall
02x17,"Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?",Ted
02x17,Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.,Marshall
02x17,"No, keep driving.",Ted
02x17,"We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.",Marshall
02x17,"It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.",Ted
02x17,"Nah, I threw them out.",Marshall
02x17,What?!,Ted
02x17,No food or drink in the Fiero.,Marshall
02x17,No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... : Thus began the longest night of our lives.,Ted
02x17,Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.,Marshall
02x17,"Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.",Ted
02x17,"Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.",Marshall
02x17,What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.,Ted
02x17,"Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.",Marshall
02x17,"But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.",Ted
02x17,Wasn't an easy decision.,Marshall
02x17,This is all because of your insane no-food rule.,Ted
02x17,It's perfectly rational.,Marshall
02x17,"Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?",Ted
02x17,Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night. We should've kept driving.,Marshall
02x17,"Come on, Marshall.",Ted
02x17,"No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.",Marshall
02x17,"That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.",Ted
02x17,Yeah?,Marshall
02x17,Are you still thinking about Lily?,Ted
02x17,Yeah.,Marshall
02x17,Please stop. And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...,Ted
02x17,Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.,Man
02x17,Zitch dog!,Marshall
02x17,Damn it!,Ted
02x17,You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.,Lily
02x17,That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.,Ted
02x17,"With privileges, from the sound of it.",Barney
02x17,Eriksen.,Mechanic
02x17,Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.,Barney
02x17,"He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.",Marshall
02x17,"Well, it's a pretty old car.",Ted
02x17,"Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.",Robin
02x17,"I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.",Marshall
02x17,How dare you...,Barney
02x17,Hey.,Robibn
02x17,I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.,Marshall
02x17,Hitchhiking Waldo. The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.,Marshall
02x17,"Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all prisoner's dilemma on me.",Robin
02x17,"The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.",Lily
02x17,"Guys, what are you talking about?",Marshall
02x17,"Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.",Lily
02x17,An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.,Robin
02x17,"I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.",Lily
02x17,"But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.",Robin
02x17,"Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. . Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kll me! This and the difference between affect and effect are the only two things he's really serious about.",Lily
02x17,"Lily, it's gonna be fine.",Robin
02x17,"No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!",Lily
02x17,"Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.",Robin
02x17,"There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.",Lily
02x17,"Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.",Robin
02x17,These cigars aren't helping at all.,Lily
02x17,Yeah. This was a terrible idea.,Robin
02x17,Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.,Lily
02x17,The broken windows?,Marshall
02x17,We had to make it look realistic.,Lily
02x17,Why did you break two of them?,Marshall
02x17,It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.,Robin
02x17,Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.,Marshall
02x17,"Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.",Lily
02x17,"Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?",Mechanic
02x17,I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.,Marshall
02x17,"Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.",Barney
02x17,"Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?",Robin
02x17,Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!,Barney
02x17,What? Why?,Lily
02x17,Why? Why? Why?! Why?!,Barney
02x17,Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.,Ted
02x17,Hey.,Ted
02x17,"Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.",Barney
02x17,"Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.",Ted
02x17,Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.,Barney
02x17,To Queens?,Ted
02x17,"Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.",Barney
02x17,"Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.",Ted
02x17,"Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.",Barney
02x17,"Wait! You know how to drive, right?",Ted
02x17,"What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.",Barney
02x17,Which pedal's the gas?,Ted
02x17,Trick question.,Barney
02x17,"No, it's not",Ted
02x17,"Yes, it is.",Barney
02x17,"No, it's not.",Ted
02x17,"Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.",Barney
02x17,"Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.",Ted
02x17,This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.,Barney
02x17,Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.,Ted
02x17,"Dude, a dog.",Barney
02x17,"Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.",Ted
02x17,"What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.",Barney
02x17,Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.,Ted
02x17,Which? Which one's the break again?,Barney
02x17,The left one.,Ted
02x17,"Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.",Barney
02x17,Make the Ls,Ted
02x17,"Oh, we're not going to make it.",Barney
02x17,Why did you just turn on the radio?,Ted
02x17,"I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.",Barney
02x17,Relax. You're being crazy.,Ted
02x17,"Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.",Barney
02x17,"Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!",Ted
02x17,I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.,Barney
02x17,We're okay.,Ted
02x17,"We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!",Barney
02x17,Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.,Robin
02x17,"Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...",Ted
02x17,"ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.",Barney
02x17,So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.,Lily
02x17,True story.,Barney
02x17,Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.,Marshall
02x17,Yes!,Barney
02x17,What?,Ted and Robin
02x17,"It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted: But 200,000...",Marshall
02x17,"But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.",Marshall
02x17,That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.,Lily
02x17,I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.,Marshall
02x17,"You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.",Ted
02x17,Affected.,Marshall
02x17,That's what I said.,Ted
02x17,"Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.",Marshall
02x17,"Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.",Maechanic
02x17,Close enough!,Marshall
02x17,Close enough!,All
02x17,"And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.",Ted 
02x17,"Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace.",Marshall
02x17,"Rot in hell, devil steed.",Barney
02x17,And what better friend is there than that?,Ted 
02x17,Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.,Marshall
02x17,Put it in.,Brother
02x17,"I am never going to get sick of this song. Never, ever, never, never, ever. Yeah!",Marshall
02x18,00 am.,"So, I can have the moving truck here by 8"
02x18,"if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?","Hey, hypothetical question"
02x18,top ten things I would've called my truck...,The category
02x20,"When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening.",Ted 
02x20,Why does my stomach hurt?,Lily
02x20,"I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.",Marshall
02x20,"Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.",Lily
02x20,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.",Tes
02x20,"No, we're not.",Lily
02x20,"Oh, really? What about the other day?",Ted
02x20,"Oh, I need to get some eggs.",Lily
02x20,"Oh, I'll come with you.",Marshall
02x20,Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.,Marshall
02x20,Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?,Barney
02x20,"Okay, we decided not to do that because of...",Marshall
02x20,Logistics. Wedding logistics.,Lily
02x20,"Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up.",Marshall
02x20,You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.,Ted
02x20,Sure we could.,Marshall
02x20,Then why don't you? You can stay with me.,Robin
02x20,It would make our wedding night more special.,Lily
02x20,"Okay, let's do it.",Marshall
02x20,Done.,Lily
02x20,I'm gonna go grab a beer.,Marshall
02x20,I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.,Lily
02x20,"Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....",Lily
02x20,Long story. I'll tell you later.,Ted
02x20,"Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.",Barney
02x20,"Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons.",Robin
02x20,"Oh, you didn't. That's right.",Marshall
02x20,So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?,Barney
02x20,"You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.",Marshall
02x20,"Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.",Lily
02x20,Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying night-night to her?,Barney
02x20,No.,Marshall
02x20,He doesn't say it. He sings it.,Lily
02x20,"Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.",Barney
02x20,Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.,Lily
02x20,What's on there?,Barney
02x20,"Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...",Lily
02x20,Retail price 319.99. What else?,Barney
02x20,"Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.",Lily
02x20,"Ah, 549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?",Barney
02x20,Did you memorize our registry?,Marshall
02x20,"No, I'm training.",Barney
02x20,Training? For what?,Marshall
02x20,"I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?",Barney
02x20,"Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.",Ted
02x20,"Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.",Barney
02x20,No way!,Marshall
02x20,What?!,Ted
02x20,"Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.",Barney
02x20,"Whoa, that is so awesome.",Marshall
02x20,"Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.",Robin
02x20,"Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.",Barney
02x20,Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.,Ted 
02x20,I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.,Lily
02x20,"Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.",Robin
02x20,I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess!  I'm too skinny for my dress!,Lily
02x20,"Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall.",Ted
02x20,"Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?",Ted
02x20,That's fantastic.,Marshall
02x20,"When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.",Ted
02x20,"Oh, crap.",Marshall
02x20,"Oh, crap.",Lily
02x20,"Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.",Marshall
02x20,That grandpa died three years ago.,Ted
02x20,"His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.",Marshall
02x20,"So which one, A or B?",Barney
02x20,What was that?,Marshall
02x20,"I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, Barney Stinson, come on down!",Barney
02x20,"Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?",Ted
02x20,"Yeah, of course.",Barney
02x20,"Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.",Barney
02x20,"It's 300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?",Lily
02x20,What happened?,Robin
02x20,"She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the 300.",Lily
02x20,"Pay the 300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?",Robin
02x20,"Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate souffle with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.",Lily
02x20,I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.,Robin
02x20,Done!,Lily
02x20,"Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.",Ted
02x20,"I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,",Marshall
02x20,"I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",Ted
02x20,Nice.,Marshall
02x20,"Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...",Ted
02x20,I love you.,Marshall
02x20,"I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.",Lily
02x20,Yeah. Ted leaves the room.,Marshall
02x20,"So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family: drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food.",Marshall
02x20,"Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?",Ted
02x20,"Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said I love you to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns",Marshall
02x20,"But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.",Ted
02x20,"Hey, Lil.",Marshall
02x20,Hey.,Lily
02x20,Hey? That's it?,Ted
02x20,What are you talking about?,Marshall
02x20,"Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do",Ted
02x20,"Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.",Ted 
02x20,"Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the 1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready?",Barney
02x20,"Oh, wow, that was pretty close.",Marshall
02x20,"Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!",Barney
02x20,"What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?",Ted
02x20,"Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.",Barney
02x20,Your father?,Ted
02x20,That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.,Barney
02x20,Your dad... is Bob Barker?,Ted
02x20,That's right,Barney
02x20,"The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?",Lily
02x20,That's Pops.,Barney
02x20,Barney?,Robin
02x20,"Yes, Robin?",Bareney
02x20,Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?,Robin
02x20,"Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.",Barney
02x20,"Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",Barney
02x20,"Oh, I don't know. That guy.",Barney
02x20,"Look, Dad, I got straight A's!",Barney
02x20,"Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?",Bareny 
02x20,"Want to play some catch, Pop?",Barney
02x20,"So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.",Barney
02x20,You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?,Ted
02x20,Why is this so hard for you people to believe?,Barney
02x20,"Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.",Robin
02x20,This is the best wedding diet ever.,Lily
02x20,I lost a pound.,Lily
02x20,That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.,Robin
02x20,I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.,Lily
02x20,"Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!",Robin
02x20,I can't.,Lily
02x20,"Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.",Robin
02x20,I'm trying.,Lily
02x20,"Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!",Robin
02x20,Okay!,Lily
02x20,"Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.",Ted
02x20,Finally.,Marshall
02x20,"Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",Ted
02x20,"Still strong, right?",Marshall
02x20,"Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall",Ted
02x20,"when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk.",Ted
02x20,"Man, I'm well nourished right now!",Ted 
02x20,Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.,Barney
02x20,"Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.",Robin
02x20,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.",Marshall
02x20,"Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.",Ted
02x20,You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.,Marshall
02x20,Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?,Lily
02x20,"Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.",Ted
02x20,"That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.",Marshall
02x20,"Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.",Ted
02x20,"I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.",Lily
02x20,I know.,Marshall
02x20,"And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.",Ted
02x20,"Marshall, what are you doing?",Ted
02x20,Going to the bathroom.,Marshall
02x20,In the hall?,Ted
02x20,Sleepwalking?,Marshall
02x20,You're wide awake.,Ted
02x20,Robbing us?,Marshall
02x20,Dude.,Ted
02x20,"Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily.",Ted 
02x20,"God, I missed you.",Lily
02x20,"I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?",Marshall
02x20,"Sure, baby.",Lily
02x20,How's the weight gaining going?,Marshall
02x20,"Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.",Lily
02x20,"Well, I'm here now.",Marshall
02x20,"And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.",Ted
02x20,To Lily and Marshall.,All
02x20,"Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.",Ted 
02x20,"Rich, what is the name of our next participant?",Bob
02x20,"Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.",Rich
02x20,"Nooo. Oh, my God!",Barney
02x20,"Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here.",Bob
02x20,"Oh, my God!","At the apartment, all"
02x20,"Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.",Barney
02x20,"Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.",Bob
02x20,"Thanks, Da... Bob.",Barney
02x20,Here is the next item up for bid!,Bob
02x20,"Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches feature an 18k gold bezel and crown and stainless steel bands.",Rich
02x20,"And Barney, what do you bid on that?",Bob
02x20,"Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is 1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say 1,350, Bob.",Barney
02x20,"1,350 for Barney.",Bob
02x20,"So, was it 1,350?","At the apartment, Lily"
02x20,I don't know. Was it?,Barney
02x20,Happy wedding.,Barney
02x20,"Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.",Bob
02x20,"Thank you, Bob.",Barney
02x20,"Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.",Bob
02x20,1 billion.,Barney
02x20,Lower.,Bob
02x20,"So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.",Barney
02x20,"Yes, Barney. This is...",Bob
02x20,What are you doing?,"At the apartment, Ted"
02x20,"Uh, spending some quality time with my dad.",Barney
02x20,"That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.",Bob
02x20,"No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.",Barney
02x20,Keep bidding.,Bob
02x20,"That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...",Bob
02x20,999.,Barney
02x20,"Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!",Bob
02x20,Happy wedding again!,Barney
02x20,"Oh, my...","At the apartement, Lily"
02x20,"I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game.",Barney
02x20,"I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.",Bob
02x20,"Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.",Barney
02x20,"Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around...",Bob
02x20,"Oh, no, you spun it too hard.","At the apartment, Ted"
02x20,"No, he didn't spin it hard enough.","At the apartment, Robin"
02x20,"Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won 1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.",Bob
02x20,"Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?",Barney
02x20,Sure.,Bob
02x20,That was kind of a weird moment.,"At the apartment, Ted"
02x20,"Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?",Bob
02x20,"Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.",Barney
02x20,"Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?",Bob
02x20,"17,640.",Millie
02x20,"17,640.",Bob
02x20,Overbid!,Barney
02x20,"Now, let's see Showcase  2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.",Bob
02x20,"Oh, I love this.",Barney
02x20,I can't believe how excited I am right now,"At the apartment, Robin"
02x20,"Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?",Bob
02x20,"Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1.",Barney
02x20,"I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!","At the apartment, Marshall"
02x20,And the actual retail price of your showcase is...,Bob
02x20,"14,628.",Barney
02x20,"14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid 18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... 18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...",Bob
02x20,"Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.",Barney
02x20,"Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...",Bob
02x20,Have your pets spayed or neutered.,Barney
02x20,Why didn't you tell him?,Ted
02x20,"Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.",Barney
02x20,Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.,Ted
02x20,"Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!",Barney
02x20,And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.,Ted 
02x20,"Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.",Marshall
02x20,"No, it's weird.",Ted
02x20,You promised.,Marshall
02x20,Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la,Ted
02x21,"In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.",Ted 
02x21,"Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.",Robin
02x21,Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.,Lily
02x21,"So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.",Lily
02x21,And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.,Barney
02x21,But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?,Robin
02x21,"Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, I do. Yeah.",Barney
02x21,"The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.",Ted 
02x21,Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.,Lily
02x21,"Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.",Robin
02x21,"Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?",Ted
02x21,You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.,Marshall
02x21,"So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.",Lily
02x21,"So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.",Lily
02x21,Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross harp player off my list.,Barney
02x21,How long is this list?,Marshall
02x21,"Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",Barney
02x21,"Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.",Lily
02x21,Sweet! I can cross off two things.,Barney
02x21,And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.,Ted 
02x21,"Hi, Lily.",Andrea
02x21,Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.,Lily
02x21,Yeah.,Andrea
02x21,How do you play the harp with your belly so...?,Robin
02x21,"Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.",Andrea
02x21,You only play half the harp?,Robin
02x21,Yeah.,Andrea
02x21,"Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?",Robin
02x21,I've been studying the harp for 12 years.,Andrea
02x21,"Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of Guitar Hero? Learned that in a day. Is there a Harp Hero?",Robin
02x21,"Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?",Lily
02x21,Tuesday.,Andrea
02x21,"Wow, that's soon.",Lily
02x21,Last Tuesday.,Andrea
02x21,"Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.",Robin
02x21,"Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, Oh, my wedding has to be perfect. Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.",Lily
02x21,Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?,Barney
02x21,No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.,Barman
02x21,"Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.",Barney
02x21,"I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.",Barman
02x21,"You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.",Barney
02x21,"Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? Hey, baby, want to pluck?",Barney
02x21,Really? That didn't work.,Robin
02x21,Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?,Barney
02x21,Bill?,Lily
02x21,Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.,Barney
02x21,Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?,Bill
02x21,Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.,Barney
02x21,"Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?",Bill
02x21,"Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",Lily
02x21,He kind of did.,Barney
02x21,That's Scooter.,Lily
02x21,"Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",Robin
02x21,His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.,Lily
02x21,Why? Why would she do that?,Robin
02x21,"Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",Lily
02x21,I'll get it.,Barney
02x21,"Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",Lily
02x21,He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.,Barney
02x21,Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.,Lily
02x21,"Me, too. I was up all night.",Barney
02x21,"Hello, Lily.",Scooter
02x21,"Hey, Bill.",Barney
02x21,"Hey, Barney.",Scooter
02x21,"Scooter, what are you doing here?",Lily
02x21,"It's not Scooter anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.",Scooter
02x21,"You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?",Lily
02x21,I want... I want... Scooter!,Lily
02x21,I need a glass of wine.,Barney
02x21,And I need you to get out of my face.,Barman
02x21,"It's for the bride, so...",Barney
02x21,"White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",Barney
02x21,You got it.,Barman
02x21,She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.,Barney
02x21,"I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.",Barman
02x21,"Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.",Barney
02x21,Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.,Barney
02x21,"Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from November Rain. By W. Axl Rose.",Scooter
02x21,That is a good song.,Robin
02x21,Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?,Brad
02x21,What's up with Bill?,Brad
02x21,That's Scooter.,Robin
02x21,I'm on it.,Brad
02x21,Hey.,Barney
02x21,Hey.,Woman
02x21,Can I have your phone number?,Barney
02x21,No.,Woman
02x21,It's for the bride.,Barney
02x21,Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.,Woman
02x21,The bride wants you to walk slower.,Barney
02x21,"Oh, wow.",Robin
02x21,"Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.",Lily
02x21,I have hairy nipples.,Robin
02x21,Really?,Lily
02x21,"No, but it worked, didn't it?",Robin
02x21,"Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.",Brad
02x21,"There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",Robin
02x21,"Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",Lily
02x21,I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.,Woman
02x21,I'm okay.,Lily
02x21,"I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.",Man
02x21,I'm fine.,Lily
02x21,Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.,Andrea
02x21,Totally cool.,Lily
02x21,"Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.",Robin
02x21,"Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.",Lily
02x21,Are you sure?,Robin
02x21,"I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads gns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",Lily
02x21,"Lily, are you okay?",Robin
02x21,What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!,Lily
02x21,What happened to I don't want a perfect wedding?,Robin
02x21,"Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.",Lily
02x21,"And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.",Robin
02x21,"What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.",Lily
02x21,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",Marshall
02x21,What?,Ted
02x21,"Well, it's not too short.",Barney
02x21,My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!,Marshall
02x21,"You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.",Barney
02x21,The good Backstreet Boys?,Ted
02x21,Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!,Marshall
02x21,What-what the hell happened to you?,Ted
02x21,"Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",Marshall
02x21,"So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",Marshall
02x21,"Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.",Cousin
02x21,"Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",Marshall
02x21,"Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.",Cousin
02x21,"I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",Marshall
02x21,I can't get married like this! There's no way!,Marshall
02x21,"Ah, let me see what I can do.",Barney
02x21,What? What can you do?,Ted
02x21,I have a superpower.,Barney
02x21,Lily is gonna kll me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.,Marshall
02x21,That's crazy. Of course she will.,Ted
02x21,Would you marry me?,Marshall
02x21,No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.,Ted
02x21,"Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",Marshall
02x21,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",Barney
02x21,"Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",Ted
02x21,"Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",Marshall
02x21,What?!,Ted
02x21,You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.,Marshall
02x21,"Dude, those guys are criminals.",Ted
02x21,"Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",Marshall
02x21,"Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",Ted
02x21,No!,Marshall
02x21,"Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",Ted
02x21,Yes.,Ben
02x21,"Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",Ted
02x21,Yeah.,Ben
02x21,Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.,Ted
02x21,"Oh, no!",Ben
02x21,"Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",Ted
02x21,"Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.",Ben
02x21,"Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",Ted
02x21,"Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee?  Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.",Ben
02x21,That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.,Ted
02x21,"Boy, that's a pretty tall order.",Ben
02x21,Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?,Ted
02x21,"No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.",Ben
02x21,Let me come at this from a different angle. I got 50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.,Ted
02x21,The bride needs this.,Barney
02x21,"Actually, I think it kinda works.",Marshall
02x21,It totally does.,Ted
02x21,Barney?,Marshall
02x21,"To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.",Barney
02x21,"Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",Marshall
02x21,"It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",Ted
02x21,"Oh, you know...",Marshall
02x21,In a bad way.,Ted
02x21,"Hey. Cool hair, bro.",Brad
02x21,What happened to your shirt?,Ted
02x21,I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.,Brad
02x21,You gonna put another shirt on?,Ted
02x21,"No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?",Brad
02x21,What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?,Marshall
02x21,"Not for long, bro. Not for long.",Brad
02x21,"Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",Marshall
02x21,It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.,Barney
02x21,"Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",Ted
02x21,"Oh, no.",Marshall
02x21,"Oh, my God! Marshall...",Lily
02x21,"Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",Marshall
02x21,"Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",Robin
02x21,What happened? Did Amy do this to you?,Lily
02x21,"Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",Marshall
02x21,"Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",Lily
02x21,"Yeah, I know. I heard.",Marshall
02x21,"My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",Lily
02x21,What? No Property of Marshall across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?,Marshall
02x21,"What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",Lily
02x21,I wish we could have that wedding.,Marshall
02x21,So do it.,Ted
02x21,What?,Marshall
02x21,"Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",Ted
02x21,"Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.",Barney
02x21,"Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",Marshall
02x21,"Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",Robin
02x21,"What do you think, baby?",Marshall
02x21,I love it.,Lily
02x21,"Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",Marshall
02x21,"Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",Lily
02x21,Okay.,Man
02x21,Thank you.,Lily
02x21,Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.,Marshall
02x21,"Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",Barney
02x21,He's gonna cry.,Robin
02x21,"No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?",Barney
02x21,"Oh, no. I don't have my vows.",Marshall
02x21,I don't have mine either.,Lily
02x21,You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.,Ted
02x21,"Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called Eggs Marshall, and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.",Marshall
02x21,No problem.,Ted
02x21,It's totally okay.,Barney
02x21,"My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96. I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.",Lily
02x21,"Hey, I found your panties!",Robin
02x21,I'm good.,Lily
02x21,"Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?",Barney
02x21,Slow down.,Lily
02x21,I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?,Barney
02x21,I do.,Marshall
02x21,"Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?",Barney
02x21,I do.,Lily
02x21,"Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",Barney
02x21,Did you smoke?,Marshall
02x21,No.,Lily
02x21,Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.,Robin
02x21,"After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.",Ted 
02x21,How do you feel?,Marshall
02x21,Tired. I got married twice today.,Lily
02x21,"So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?",Marshall
02x21,"What do you think? Bathroom, of course.",Lily
02x21,Please don't.,Ted
02x21,"Sorry, Ted.",Marshall and Lily
02x22,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin.",Man
02x22,Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?,Lily
02x22,"You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.",Marshall
02x22,You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.,Lily
02x22,"Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker.",Marshall
02x22,Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.,Lily
02x22,I got it. You ready? You ready?,Marshall
02x22,Yeah.,Lily
02x22,"Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?",Marshall
02x22,"I love you, Mr. Awesome.",Lily
02x22,"I love you, Mrs. Awesome.",Marshall
02x22,So...,Ted
02x22,So...,Robin
02x22,Wedding's over.,Ted
02x22,"Yes, it is.",Robin
02x22,"I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.",Ted
02x22,Tell people what?,Barney
02x22,"Hi, Barney.",Robin
02x22,Tell people what?,Barney
02x22,"The food looks delicious, doesn't it?",Ted
02x22,Tell people what?,Barney
02x22,Nothing.,Robin
02x22,"Oh, okay. Tell people what?",Barney
02x22,Can we talk about this later?,Ted
02x22,Absolutely. Tell people what?,Barney
02x22,Hi. Have you met Barney?,Robin
02x22,"Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?",Barney
02x22,"Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?",Ted
02x22,Okay.,Barney
02x22,"Whoo, that was a close one.",Ted
02x22,Think he'll actually let it go?,Robin
02x22,Can I get a water please?,Robin
02x22,Tell people what?,Barney
02x22,"Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.",Robin
02x22,But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.,Ted
02x22,So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.,Robin
02x22,Fine.,Barney
02x22,"It's pretty big, though.",Ted
02x22,"Oh, my God, just tell me!",Barney
02x22,"Oh, help us.",Lily
02x22,What's wrong?,Robin
02x22,"We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it.",Lily
02x22,"Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.",Marshall
02x22,"All right, let's run some interference.",Robin
02x22,"Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.",Ted
02x22,"Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful.",Lily's grandma
02x22,"Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...",Lily
02x22,And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.,Lily's grandma
02x22,And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.,Marshall
02x22,"All right, let's get these two back to their table.",Robin
02x22,"We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?",Lily's grandma
02x22,The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.,Ted
02x22,Conga line.,Robin
02x22,"Oh, yes, definitely.",Lily
02x22,How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's Time of Your Life and ending with your baby photos side by side.,Ted
02x22,"Oh, that's great. Going on the list.",Lily
02x22,What list?,Barney
02x22,Horrible wedding cliches we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.,Lily
02x22,"Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.",Barney
02x22,How's it go?,Robin
02x22,"Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on it's own way. It is not irritable or resentful. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things... endures all things.",Marshall
02x22,Lame.,Robin
02x22,Going on the list.,Lily
02x22,We've done it. A wedding with zero cliches.,Lily
02x22,"Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a cliche?",Ted
02x22,"Well, okay, one cliche.",Lily
02x22,"Well, technically two.",Marshall
02x22,No! They cleared our plates again!,Lily
02x22,"Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.",Marshall
02x22,"Well, you still have me.",Lily
02x22,Yeah...,Marshall
02x22,"Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.",Barney
02x22,"No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...",Lily
02x22,Are those mini quiches?  Tell the secret.,Barney
02x22,"Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?",Ted
02x22,"Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.",Barney
02x22,"What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.",Ted
02x22,Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.,Barney
02x22,"Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...",Robin
02x22,Champagne?,Waiter
02x22,"Um, we didn't order champagne.",Robin
02x22,Compliments of the house.,Waiter
02x22,Wow. Thanks. Cheers.,Ted
02x22,"And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...",Robin 
02x22,Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.,Lily
02x22,"Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away. So what was in the glass?",Barney
02x22,"Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, Champagne? We didn't order any champagne. Compliments of the house. Wow.",Ted
02x22,You said that already!,Barney
02x22,"Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...",Ted 
02x22,Is an engagement ring.,Robin
02x22,Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?,Man
02x22,Don't get married.,Barney
02x22,Why don't I come back.,Man
02x22,"An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do",Barney
02x22,That's what she said.,Ted
02x22,"No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.",Robin
02x22,What are you talking about?,Ted
02x22,"This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.",Robin
02x22,That's not mine.,Ted
02x22,What?,Robin
02x22,That's not mine.,Ted
02x22,Then whose is it?,Robin
02x22,It's mine. Janna... will you marry me?,Man
02x22,Yes.,Janna
02x22,Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.,Robin
02x22,What the hell was that?,Ted
02x22,What the hell was what?,Robin
02x22,That reaction?,Ted
02x22,I thought you were proposing to me.,Robin
02x22,Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.,Ted
02x22,"Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.",Robin
02x22,Now more than ever.,Ted
02x22,"I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?",Robin
02x22,No.,Ted
02x22,Then why is this an issue?,Robin
02x22,"Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.",Ted
02x22,"Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?",Robin
02x22,No.,Ted
02x22,"Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.",Marshall
02x22,So did you guys find anything to eat?,Robin
02x22,I had four strawberries.,Lily
02x22,Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?,Ted
02x22,Yes.,Lily 
02x22,"Lily, you could have burped or said the word Yes, but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.",Marshall
02x22,"Oh, look, more strawberries!",Lily
02x22,So what happened next?,Barney
02x22,"Ted, don't do this.",Robin
02x22,"No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?",Ted
02x22,Where do you see yourself?,Robin
02x22,"Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.",Ted
02x22,And I probably want to be in Argentina.,Robin
02x22,Argentina?,Ted
02x22,"Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.",Robin
02x22,"We have an expiration date, don't we?",Ted
02x22,"Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.",Barney
02x22,Barney... story's not over.,Ted
02x22,Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?,Robin
02x22,"Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...",Ted
02x22,"Oh, my God, it's you.",Waiter
02x22,Wha... what?,Ted
02x22,You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.,Waiter
02x22,Run!,Ted
02x22,Run? Your strategy was run?,Barney
02x22,It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.,Ted
02x22,Yeah? And how did that work out for you?,Robin
02x22,I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.,Ted
02x22,"Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?",Robin
02x22,"Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!",Ted
02x22,So... Argentina.,Ted
02x22,Argentina.,Robin
02x22,Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?,Ted
02x22,"Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.",Robin
02x22,I could want to live in Argentina.,Ted
02x22,"No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.",Robin
02x22,"Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.",Ted
02x22,"So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?",Robin
02x22,"Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.",Ted
02x22,"Oh, shut up.",Robin
02x22,You're scared I might not be kidding.,Ted
02x22,Aren't you?,Robin
02x22,"Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.",Ted
02x22,Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.,Robin
02x22,"No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.",Barney
02x22,Right? Right?,Robin
02x22,You caught the bouquet?,Barney
02x22,Barney. The story's not over yet.,Ted
02x22,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.",Robin
02x22,What?,Ted
02x22,I don't know if I can do this to you.,Robin
02x22,Do what?,Ted
02x22,"Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.",Robin
02x22,"Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black X over Argentina.",Ted
02x22,You know what I mean.,Robin
02x22,"No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",Ted
02x22,"Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.",Robin
02x22,"That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted.",Barney
02x22,"Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?",Robin
02x22,"Well, we probably shouldn't.",Robin
02x22,Yeah.,Ted
02x22,Risk it?,Robin
02x22,Risk it.,Ted
02x22,No.,Barney
02x22,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.",Man
02x22,"No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.",Barney
02x22,"Come on, they're cutting the cake.",Robin
02x22,"Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.",Barney
02x22,"Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a cliche, remember?",Marshall
02x22,"No, it's going to be so funny.",Lily
02x22,"Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry.",Marshall
02x22,Whoopsy-daisy.,Lily
02x22,"And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much.",Marshall
02x22,We love you. I love you.,Lily
02x22,"Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.",Barney
02x22,"God, this guy's giving me nothing.",Man
02x22,"All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, What's up?",Ted
02x22,"Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave.",Marshall
02x22,"Hey, kiddo.",Ted
02x22,"The story's not over, Barney.",Ted
02x22,"Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.",Ted
02x22,"Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.",Robin
02x22,Not a euphemism.,Ted
02x22,"Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.",Robin
02x22,"Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.",Ted
02x22,That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.,Robin
02x22,"Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...",Ted
02x22,"Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?",Robin
02x22,"We're not doing this, are we?",Ted
02x22,I don't want to have kids in Argentina.,Robin
02x22,And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.,Ted
02x22,So where does that leave us?,Robin
02x22,Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.,Ted
02x22,You stole a blue French horn for me.,Robin
02x22,I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.,Ted
02x22,You did break up.,Barney
02x22,Yep.,Ted
02x22,You're not pregnant?,Barney
02x22,Nope.,Robin
02x22,An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?,Barney
02x22,"Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...",Ted
02x22,We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.,Robin
02x22,You guys okay?,Barney
02x22,"Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...",Ted
02x22,But we're okay.,Robin
02x22,The open bar helps.,Ted
02x22,"Excuse me, Miss.",Kid
02x22,Hi.,Robin
02x22,Could I have this dance?,Kid
02x22,"Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.",Ted
02x22,"This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver.",Marshall
02x22,Hello!,Ranjit
02x22,"Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?",Marshall
02x22,"You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch.",Ranjit
02x22,"Um, no, we actually had something else in mind.",Marshall
02x22,Okay.,Ranjit
02x22,"Lily, go sit down.",Marshall
02x22,Welcome to Wienerburger.,Man
02x22,"Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions.",Marshall
02x22,Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?,Man
02x22,"No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married.",Marshall
02x22,Wow. Congratulations.,Man
02x22,Thank you.,Marshall
02x22,"That's 7.80. Hey, dude.",Man
02x22,Yeah.,Marshall
02x22,"I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash.",Man
02x22,My wife...,Marshall
02x22,"So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.",Ted 
02x22,"I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.",Barney
02x22,"Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?",Ted
02x22,"The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for the one again. The only time I want to hear you saying the one is if it's followed by the word hundredth. What up?",Barney
02x22,"No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?",Ted
02x22,"Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.",Barney
02x22,Yeah.,Ted
02x22,"I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.",Barney
02x22,Could be.,Ted
02x22,Ted?,Barney
02x22,"Yes, Barney.",Ted
02x22,Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?,Barney
02x22,I do.,Ted
02x22,"Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it...",Barney
03x01,"Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.",Narrator
03x01,"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full.",Barney
03x01,I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.,Ted
03x01,When will you be ready?,Barney
03x01,It was a good question.,Narrator
03x01,I grew my breakup beard.,Narrator
03x01,"Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.",Barney
03x01,I'm not ready.,Ted
03x01,I repainted the apartment.,Narrator
03x01,Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah.,Barney
03x01,I'm not ready.,Ted
03x01,"And the truth is, I was doing really good.",Narrator
03x01,Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get Cirque de So-Laid. What up?,Barney
03x01,"Barney, come on, we've covered this.",Ted
03x01,Robin!,Lily
03x01,"Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael.",Robin
03x01,Hola.,Gael
03x01,"Okay, I'm ready.",Ted
03x01,"I just can't believe her.  We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup.",Ted
03x01,"What do you mean Win the breakup, old timey inventor.",Lily
03x01,"What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers.",Marshall
03x01,"It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition.",Lily
03x01,That's my wife.,Marshall
03x01,"Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?",Barney
03x01,Gael.,Gael
03x01,"I'm sorry, Gayle?",Ted
03x01,Gael.,Gael
03x01,Kyle?,Barney
03x01,Gael.,Gael
03x01,Girl?,Marshall
03x01,It's pronounced guy-el.,Robin
03x01,"It's means joyful. That is why I live my life by bringing joy, good energy and happiness to others. Especially those less fortunate that I.",Gael
03x01,I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?,Ted
03x01,What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.,Ted
03x01,"That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.",Barney
03x01,"And, oh, he is a masseuse.",Ted
03x01,With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat.,Gael
03x01,"One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.",Ted
03x01,Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.,Gael
03x01,"How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.",Barney
03x01,Not possible. You cannot have sx on a windsurfing board.,Barney
03x01,How do you know?,Lily
03x01,"Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which on which it's possible to have sx. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sx in on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.",Barney
03x01,"To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.",Lily
03x01,This conversation never happened.,Barney
03x01,"All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.",Ted
03x01,Yes!,Barney
03x01,"You guys, have fun of your duble date.",Ted
03x01,"Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull.",Lily
03x01,And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars.,Gael
03x01,"Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?",Lily
03x01,There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.,Marshall
03x01,"No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy.",Lily
03x01,"Well, you did.",Marshall
03x01,I'm one of the lucky few.,Lily
03x01,"Lily, Ted is our best friend, so let's get something straight: Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact.",Marshall
03x01,"So that night, as Lily and Marshall did their best to hate Gael...",Narrator
03x01,"Hey, Robin.  Gael.",Lily
03x01,"...Robin pulled me aside to check in. Now, I'm sure, she meant the best, but she said the worst.",Narrator
03x01,I just want to make sure you're okay with this.,Robin
03x01,"I just want to make sure you're okay with this? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?",Ted
03x01,"Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah.",Barney
03x01,Amy.,Amy
03x01,Ted.,Ted
03x01,"Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!",Barney
03x01,Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot?,Marshall
03x01,"I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God!",Lily
03x01,I just hope Ted's okay.,Robin
03x01,Hmm.,Marshall
03x01,"I hate to see you so tense.  I mean, we had a really clean break up, you know? We really acted like adults, so the last thing... Oh! Oh, God, oh!",Gael
03x01,"Gael, are you properly licensed massage therapist?",Marshall
03x01,What?,Gael
03x01,Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity?,Marshall
03x01,I train for three years at an institute in Buenos Aires. I have a card. I can show you.,Gael

03x01,"Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.",Ted
03x01,"Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?",Barney
03x01,Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.,Ted
03x01,Yeah. But I didn't get to help.,Barney

03x01,Apology accepted. Let's go.,Barney
03x01,Who's the suit?,Amy
03x01,"Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.",Ted

03x01,"Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. Beat it, nerd.",Amy
03x01,"Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!",Barney

03x01,"Oh, I forgive you, Mom.",Lily
03x01,"Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy.",Marshall
03x01,"Oh, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was building him up so few minutes later, I could totally cut him down.",Lily
03x01,Weren't you wearing a bra?,Marshall
03x01,The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks...  sort of.,Narrator
03x01,They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble.,Barney
03x01,Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vg1n?,Amy
03x01,"You... your vg1n... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.",Barney
03x01,Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.,Amy

03x01,"No, your tatts... toos. Your tattoos.",Ted

03x01,Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.,Amy
03x01,"Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?",Barney

03x01,"I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.",Ted
03x01,"You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path.",Barney
03x01,That dark path is my driveway.,Ted
03x01,But you need a plan and you need a wingman!,Barney
03x01,This is so going in my blog!,Barney
03x01,Want to have sx?,Amy's friend

03x01,And that's all I remember.,Narrator
03x01,"Hey, buddy, how was your night?",Marshall
03x01,"You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don't worry, I didn't. But it was... It was amazing. I think it's safe to say, I am winning this breakup.",Ted
03x01,Look.,Lily
03x01,Oh my God!,Marshall
03x01,What?,Ted
03x01,Nothing. This J. Crew catalog. Who brings two golden retrievers in a canoe?,Marshall
03x01,We've gotta call Barney.,Lily
03x01,Way ahead of you.,Marshall
03x01,"Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again.",Barney
03x01,"Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?",Lily
03x01,What?,Barney
03x01,Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?,Marshall
03x01,And up we go.,Marshall
03x01,Thank you.,Marshall
03x01,Hum. Hum. What?,Ted
03x01,Ted?,Barney
03x01,Hmm?,Ted
03x01,I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.,Barney
03x01,"Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.",Ted
03x01,"See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.",Barney
03x01,Hmm.,Ted
03x01,"Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.",Barney
03x01,He's gonna say it.,Lily
03x01,A butterfly?  What?,Ted
03x01,"Nothing, buddy.",Barney
03x01,Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God!  I have a tattoo.,Ted
03x01,"Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.",Barney
03x01,Tramp stamp?,Ted
03x01,"You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.",Barney
03x01,And suddenly it all came back to me.,Narrator
03x01,"Mm, I just broke up with my boyfriend Steve. He was totally annoying. He was like, I think you're the one, I want to marry you.",Amy
03x01,What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends?,Ted
03x01,"Yeah. Sure, I mean, we're still friends, right Steve?",Amy
03x01,"Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait.",Ted
03x01,No no no no no no no. Give me this.,Ted
03x01,"Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.",Barney
03x01,Maybe you should try club soda.,Marshall
03x01,"Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night?",Ted
03x01,Last night got weird.,Marshall
03x01,Feel the emotions release.,Gael
03x01,Think I just got over being chunky in the ninth grade.,Marshall
03x01,You're beautiful.,Gael
03x01,I am beautiful.,Marshall
03x01,Experience your food.,Gael
03x01,Try the mango.,Gael
03x01,"Okay, that's enough of the fruit.",Gael
03x01,"We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again.",Marshall
03x01,It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good.,Lily
03x01,I can't even look at you two right now.,Ted
03x01,Ted.,Marshall
03x01,He got a tramp stamp.,Lily
03x01,Okay.,Robin
03x01,"Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?",Ted
03x01,"If you feel like you need to do that, then...",Robin
03x01,"I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!",Ted
03x01,You shaved.,Robin
03x01,I did.,Ted
03x01,I like the beard.,Robin
03x01,"Okay, I'm done.",Ted
03x01,I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.,Robin
03x01,"Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.",Ted
03x01,"Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.",Robin
03x01,You weren't trying to win the break-up?,Ted
03x01,I was trying to survive it.,Robin
03x01,"Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.",Ted
03x01,He's not an Adonis.,Robin
03x01,He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.,Ted
03x01,He's not perfect.,Robin
03x01,"Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.",Ted
03x01,You're bigger.,Robin
03x01,"Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.",Ted
03x01,"No, Ted... you're bigger.",Robin
03x01,"Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before.  It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.",Narrtor
03x01,Go for Barney.,Barney
03x01,"Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.",Marshall
03x01,What is it?,Barney
03x01,Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.,Marshall
03x01,What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?,Barney
03x01,No.  No!,Barney
03x02,"So, beeing married, different? Not different?",Ted
03x02,"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.",Marshall
03x02,I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.,Barney
03x02,"No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.",Marshall
03x02,"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...",Lily
03x02,Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?,Barney
03x02,It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.,Lily
03x02,It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.,Marshall
03x02,"Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round.",Lily
03x02,Thanks.,Ted
03x02,I am such a jerk.,Marshall
03x02,"Yeah. Wait, why?",Barney
03x02,I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.,Marshall
03x02,Marshall brownies.,Ted
03x02,"Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.",Marshall
03x02,"That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.",Barney
03x02,"Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.",Ted
03x02,"No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...",Barney
03x02,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there.",Marshall
03x02,You guys are jerks!,Marshall
03x02,"Away from her normal home, her normal life, and it turns out, her normal self.",Narrator
03x02,"I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before.",Robin
03x02,Here. Eat. If we run out of fish I will catch more with my hands.,Gael
03x02,A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!,Robin
03x02,And here I am at the drum circle.,Robin
03x02,"Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.",Barney
03x02,Seen 'em.,Ted
03x02,Wow. It seems like a great trip.,Lily
03x02,"Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know.",Robin
03x02,Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.,Lily
03x02,"You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker.",Barney
03x02,Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.,Lily
03x02,"What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
03x02,I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
03x02,Thank you.,Robin
03x02,"Man, this is like Where's Waldo of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo.",Lily
03x02,"I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.",Robin
03x02,"Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a Best if banged by sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being Unevolved Robin, the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
03x02,I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
03x02,"I'm telling you, within three days...",Barney
03x02,"Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.",Lily
03x02,"Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association.",Barney
03x02,My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.  b,Robin
03x02,What are we talking of? Baseball?,Gael
03x02,"This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.",Barney
03x02,I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant.,Ted

03x02,"My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother.  And that's all I remember until the hospital.",Gael
03x02,That guy...,Barney
03x02,Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.,Ted
03x02,"Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?",Barney
03x02,He's better looking than us.,Ted
03x02,No. Because he's from out of town.,Barney
03x02,Mmm.,Ted
03x02,"Yeah. Plus atmatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.",Ted

03x02,I think it's cool.,Ted
03x02,We'll see you tomorrow.,Colleen

03x02,"Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip.",Lily
03x02,"But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow.",Robin
03x02,"Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?",Robin

03x02,"Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it.",Marshall
03x02,I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong?,Lily

03x02,How can you open my letter?,Lily
03x02,"That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.",Marshall
03x02,"Marshall, wait.  This was our first fight as a married couple.",Lily
03x02,"Oh, baby.",Marshall
03x02,Oh.,Lily

03x02,148th and Brook Avenue.,Lindsay
03x02,A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get klled.,Ted

03x02,"There were three of them, at least two gns... they took all our money.",Ted
03x02,Well. I only had traveler's checks.,Barney
03x02,"Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight.",Marshall
03x02,Yes?,Lily
03x02,"I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.",Marshall
03x02,"Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.",Lily
03x02,You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter?,Marshall
03x02,"Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.",Lily
03x02,Really?,Marshall
03x02,"Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again.",Lily
03x02,"Lily, I won't, I promise.",Marshall
03x02,Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder.,Lily
03x02,"Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?",Marshall
03x02,I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?,Lily
03x02,You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,Marshall
03x02,What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,Barney
03x02,"Thank God, we're alive sx.",Ted
03x02,"Thank God we're alive sx. It's even better than I can't believe you just proposed to me sx, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.",Barney
03x02,All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.,Ted
03x02,Whew.,Ted
03x02,Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover.,Lindsay
03x02,Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know?,Colleen
03x02,Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?,Barney
03x02,What? West village?,Ted
03x02,Close. West Orange.,Colleen
03x02,West Orange? New Jersey?,Ted
03x02,Yeah.,Collee
03x02,"You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?",Ted
03x02,Theodore.,Barney
03x02,Yep.,Colleen
03x02,New Jersey?,Ted
03x02,Teddy?,Barney
03x02,"Yeah. But don't worry, it's pretty much New York.",Colleen
03x02,"Oh, no. Oh, no.",Ted
03x02,"Oh, no.",Barney
03x02,New Jersey is not pretty much New York. You are not pretty much new yorkers.,Ted
03x02,And how would you know?,Colleen
03x02,"Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to pretty much New York? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",Ted
03x02,"You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc...",Barney
03x02,Ew.  Can we get a ride?,Colleen
03x02,"Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?",Barney
03x02,"Newark, born and raised.",Policeman
03x02,Can you please keep it down?,Robin
03x02,"What happened to you, man? You said you wouldn't change, but look at you. No more tan, no more beaded braids, no more lush, untamed forest of leg and armpit hair. You're back at work. What gives?",Robin  2
03x02,Well. I have to have a job.,Robin
03x02,"I have to have a job, God, that's so american.",Robin  2
03x02,I'm canadian. You know that.,Robin
03x02,"What about the important things like making your own jewerly and lying on the beach and thinking about peace? God, don't you care about thinking about peace?",Robin  2
03x02,Wow. I just realized something.,Robin
03x02,That you've lost your way.,Robin  2
03x02,"No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.",Robin
03x02,Don't you remember Argentina?,Robin  2
03x02,Don't you want to go back?,Robin  2
03x02,What are you doing?,Robin
03x02,Shh. Let this happen.,Robin  2
03x02,"All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!",Robin
03x02,"All right, we're living, we're leaving, okay. Michael Moore was so right about americans.",All
03x02,I'm canadian!,Robin
03x02,"Robin, are you okay?",Gael
03x02,"No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something.",Robin
03x02,"After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin.",Narrator
03x02,"Welcome home, Scherbatsky.",Barney
03x02,"Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.",Robin
03x02,Listening.,Barney
03x02,This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like.,Robin
03x02,"Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it?",Lily
03x02,Totally. What does it say?,Marshall
03x02,"Marshall, I'm serious.",Lily
03x02,"Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead.",Marshall
03x02,Okay.,Lily
03x02,"And through 22 wonderful years of marriage, Marshall kept his promise.",Narrator
03x02,"Until November 1 of last year when, sadly...",Narrator
03x02,"Busted! I knew you'd read this. You suck, Marshall, you totally suck.",Lily 
03x02,That's it? I suck. Lily.,Marshall
03x02,"Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did.",Lily
03x02,"Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here.",Marshall
03x02,"Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures.",Lily
03x02,I don't want 'em now.,Marshall
03x02,What is that supposed to mean?,Lily
03x02,What?! Nothing. Nothing. You're beautiful. I would love the photos. Have I told you how beautiful you look?,Marshall
03x03,"Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story from back before I met your mother. But there are some stories you tell and some stories you don't.",Future Ted
03x03,Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.,Ted
03x03,"Use your words, Ted.",Barney
03x03,"OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.",Ted
03x03,The belt?,Barney
03x03,The belt.,Ted
03x03,But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.,Barney
03x03,"Yes, advantage Ericksen.",Marshall
03x03,Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.,Barney
03x03,"Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.",Marshall
03x03,"All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.",Ted
03x03,Can't go. Tournament.,Marshall
03x03,"What? We agreed, I suited up.",Ted
03x03,You take too long to get ready,Barney
03x03,"What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.",Ted
03x03,"Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.",Marshall
03x03,And then he starts on his hair. Ace.,Barney
03x03,"Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?",Ted
03x03,"Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.",Barney
03x03,Really?,Ted
03x03,Yes.,Barney
03x03,"All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.",Ted
03x03,"3 beers, 5 minutes.",Ted
03x03,Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?,Robin
03x03,"Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy.",Lily
03x03,I saw it first.,Lily
03x03,"You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
03x03,"So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?",Barney
03x03,"You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?",Lily
03x03,"Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.",Robin
03x03,"FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.",Barney
03x03,Shekwakie.,Marshall
03x03,Stinson.,Barney
03x03,"All right, the beers are here.",Ted
03x03,"Yeah, we're not gonna make it.",Barney
03x03,"Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?",Ted
03x03,"Yeah, pants are off.",Barney
03x03,"This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio.",Marshall
03x03,"Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.",Ted
03x03,Ted.,Trudy
03x03,Trudy.,Trudy
03x03,"Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...",Ted
03x03,"I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape?",Trudy
03x03,That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.,Ted
03x03,"No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.",Ted
03x03,"You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window.",Trudy
03x03,And I forgot my underwear.,Trudy
03x03,"Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.",Ted
03x03,I am so glad I ran into you.,Trudy
03x03,"I know, do you wanna get a...",Ted
03x03,"Trudy, no way!",Rachel
03x03,"Oh my God, Rachel, how are you?",Trudy
03x03,"Ted, this is Rachel.",Trudy
03x03,Hi.,Rachel
03x03,Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo!,"Rachel, Trudy"
03x03,"Let me guess, you guys met in prison.",Ted
03x03,"No, we're sorority sisters.",Rachel
03x03,"And best friends forever, all sophomore year.",Trudy
03x03,When we weren't at each other's throats.,Rachel
03x03,We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now.,Trudy
03x03,"Hey, mista...",Rachel
03x03,"... hey mista, stay away from my sista.","Rachel, Trudy"
03x03,We have so much catching up do to.,Trudy
03x03,"OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding?",Rachel
03x03,"Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes.",Trudy
03x03,No! Again? That's like her third one.,Rachel
03x03,I know.,Trudy
03x03,"Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.",Ted
03x03,"So, Trudy and I got a table.",Rachel
03x03,"Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.",Ted
03x03,But I want you to stay.,Rachel
03x03,Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.,Ted
03x03,"OK, guys, be cool.",Ted
03x03,"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.",Marshall
03x03,That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,Barney
03x03,Stinson.,Barney
03x03,"I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.",Ted
03x03,"You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.",Barney
03x03,"So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.",Ted
03x03,So you now have two on the line?,Barney
03x03,And I don't know which one to go for.,Ted
03x03,Go for the new girl.,Barney
03x03,"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.",Barney
03x03,New girl? What new girl?,Lily
03x03,Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...,Barney
03x03,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.",Lily
03x03,Are they friends?,Lily
03x03,"Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.",Ted
03x03,Are they Betas?,Lily
03x03,Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.,Lily
03x03,"They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.",Ted
03x03,"OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.",Lily
03x03,I thought we were in for the evening.,Marshall
03x03,"That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.",Barney
03x03,"Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?",Trudy
03x03,"Well, that's very complicated.",Ted
03x03,"See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief.",Rachel
03x03,"You're the man-thief, man-thief.",Trudy
03x03,"Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.",Ted
03x03,You're so funny. I think Ted is funny.,Trudy
03x03,Really? I think Ted is hilarious.,Rachel
03x03,I am never not wearing a suit again.,Ted
03x03,Hello.,Ted
03x03,"It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.",Lily
03x03,"Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?",Ted
03x03,"What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.",Lily
03x03,They are? Are you sure?,Ted
03x03,"Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.",Lily
03x03,Are you positive?,Ted
03x03,That is so fascinating. So what happened?,Robin
03x03,"Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday.",Robin's date
03x03,"Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.",Robin
03x03,"True, but now the parents don't know what to do with their huge supply of four-legged overalls.",Robin's date
03x03,That is so funny. You are so funny.,Robin
03x03,"Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.",Lily
03x03,"Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.",Lily
03x03,Bye mom.,Ted
03x03,My mom.,Ted
03x03,Hello.,Lily
03x03,Bring me a razor.,Robin
03x03,What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?,Lily
03x03,They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.,Robin
03x03,"No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...",Lily
03x03,"Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.",Robin
03x03,I'm on my way.,Lily
03x03,"So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?",Ted
03x03,Neither of us.,Trudy
03x03,"He left, junior year abroad.",Rachel
03x03,It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do.,Trudy
03x03,"We were gonna do, but never did.",Rachel
03x03,"What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.",Ted
03x03,"No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him.",Rachel
03x03,"No, you tell him.",Trudy
03x03,I don't care if you don't care.,Rachel
03x03,I don't care.,Trudy
03x03,"Nobody cares, just say it.",Ted
03x03,Why don't we tell him together?,Rachel
03x03,"OK, on three.",Trudy
03x03,One.,Trudy
03x03,"Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.",Lily
03x03,Two.,Trudy
03x03,Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.,Lily
03x03,Three,Trudy
03x03,It's a tricycle.,Ted
03x03,"No way, no way, no way!",Barney
03x03,What's happening?,Marshall
03x03,It's a tricycle.,Ted
03x03,"No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.",Marshall
03x03,"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.",Lily
03x03,Put him on speaker.,Barney
03x03,So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?,Barney
03x03,"Wait wait wait, what belt?",Marshall
03x03,Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.,Ted
03x03,"Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?",Marshall
03x03,You actually bought a belt.,Ted
03x03,"That's right, it's resplendent.",Barney
03x03,"It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.",Ted
03x03,"I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...",Barney
03x03,Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.,Marshall
03x03,"If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.",Marshall
03x03,"If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s.",Lily
03x03,"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?",Ted
03x03,"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?",Barney
03x03,Yes.,Ted
03x03,"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.",Barney
03x03,Yes.,Ted
03x03,"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?",Barney
03x03,What? No.,Ted
03x03,Ted?,Barney
03x03,"No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.",Ted
03x03,"Oh, are you guys leaving?",Ted
03x03,"Well, it is getting pretty late.",Rachel
03x03,"Right, well...",Ted
03x03,I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.,Trudy
03x03,"Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.",Ted
03x03,"I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?",Rachel
03x03,That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.,Ted
03x03,"Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, Please, don't, I love my dead wife, but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.",Marshall
03x03,"Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.",Lily
03x03,I already did this morning.,Marshall
03x03,Hello.,Lily
03x03,"Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.",Robin
03x03,"Sorry, I can't leave now.",Lily
03x03,"Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian",Robin
03x03,There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?,Robin
03x03,"No, but fifty will.",Waitress
03x03,"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars.",Barney
03x03,We're combing upsars? What does that mean?,Marshall
03x03,He's coming upstairs!,Lily
03x03,Where are my pants? Where's my pants!,Marshall
03x03,Got 'em.,Ted
03x03,"Ooh, nice place!",Rachel
03x03,"Hey, are these your roommates?",Rachel
03x03,"Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.",Ted
03x03,You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.,Rachel
03x03,That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.,Ted
03x03,"OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble.",Rachel
03x03,Of course we can't promise anything.,Trudy
03x03,This is gonna be awesome.,Ted
03x03,No!,Ted
03x03,"What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",Ted
03x03,"We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",Lily
03x03,"Yeah bro, up top.",Marshall
03x03,"Oh, don't be gross.",Lily
03x03,"You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",Ted
03x03,"No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",Marshall
03x03,"Oh, you can use our bedroom.",Lily
03x03,"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",Ted
03x03,What are you doing?,Ted
03x03,I cannot allow Ted to do this.,Barney
03x03,"Why, why?",Ted
03x03,Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,Barney
03x03,"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",Marshall
03x03,"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",Barney
03x03,"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",Barney
03x03,"Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel.",Blonde Girl
03x03,OK.,Brunette Girl
03x03,I'll get the video camera.,Barney
03x03,Get out!,Blonde Girl
03x03,OK then.,Barney
03x03,Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,Ted
03x03,Tom Petty.,Marshall
03x03,Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,Ted
03x03,Where's Lily?,Ted
03x03,"Still looking for that CD, so...",Ted
03x03,What are you doing?,Ted
03x03,I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,Lily
03x03,I saw it first.,Lily
03x03,"You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
03x03,"I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",Lily
03x03,"Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",Ted
03x03,"No, never.",Lily
03x03,"What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",Ted
03x03,"Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",Lily
03x03,"OK, take it.",Ted
03x03,Wish me luck.,Ted
03x03,Oh my God.,Barney
03x03,Where's the shaving cream?,Robin
03x03,"Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.",Waitress
03x03,"Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",Robin
03x03,"Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?",Waitress
03x03,"Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",Robin
03x03,"Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.",Waitress
03x03,"Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?",Robin's date
03x03,Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,Robin
03x03,Yeah.,Robin's date
03x03,You've gotta be kidding me.,Robin
03x03,Excuse me.,Robin
03x03,"So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",Ted
03x03,"That's OK, we don't need music to have fun.",Rachel
03x03,Exactly.,Ted
03x03,"You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?",Trudy
03x03,"It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",Ted
03x03,"I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.",Lily
03x03,"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",Marshall
03x03,Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors sht themselves in the foot.,Barney
03x03,"What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night.",Lily
03x03,"So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?",Blonde Girl
03x03,"Oh no, the night's ruined!",Barney
03x03,"No, baby, it's not.",Brunette Girl
03x03,Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,Barney
03x03,Why would you do that to yourself?,Marshall
03x03,"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",Barney
03x03,"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",Ted
03x03,"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.",Barney
03x03,It won't?,Ted
03x03,"No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",Barney
03x03,"Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.",Ted
03x03,Oh!,"Trudy, Rachel"
03x03,"Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.",Ted
03x03,I am so exhausted.,Rachel
03x03,So exhausted.,Trudy
03x03,Why would I want to tire them out?,Ted
03x03,That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,Barney
03x03,You give the most amazing foot massage.,Rachel
03x03,It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.,Ted
03x03,Why in God's name would I say that?,Ted
03x03,"Ted, what's wrong?",Trudy
03x03,I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.,Ted
03x03,"OK, what the hell.",Ted
03x03,"OK, wait for it.",Barney
03x03,"Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.",Ted
03x03,Oh my God.,Rachel
03x03,That's so true.,Trucy
03x03,Yeah.,Ted
03x03,"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",Ted
03x03,Yes you can.,Barney
03x03,"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.",Lily
03x03,All right.,Ted
03x03,I'll see you on the other side.,Ted
03x03,"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.",Barney
03x03,What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,Barney
03x03,"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",Barney
03x03,"You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!",Barney
03x03,"Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.",Ted
03x03,"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?",Barney
03x03,"Ted, belt.",Barney
03x03,Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,Barney
03x03,Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK?,Robin's date
03x03,No problem.,Waitress
03x03,"No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open.",Waitress
03x03,"I guess I shouldn't be so surprised. I mean, she was acting weird all night, right? Waitress: Yeah. You know...",Robins' date
03x03,Why don't I buy you a drink?,Waitress
03x03,OK.,Robin's date
03x03,Did I overhear that you're a surgeon?,Waitress
03x03,Guilty as charged.,Robin's date
03x03,You're so funny.,Waitress
03x03,"I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.",Robin
03x04,"It was Saturday night in New York City and the young metropolitan set was out on the town, living the kind of crazy lifestyle you can only find in the Big Apple.",Future Ted VO
03x04,"97, 98, 99, 100!","Robin, Ted"
03x04,100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon.,Lily
03x04,"So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart.",Lily
03x04,What's his 'but'?,Ted
03x04,What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.,Lily
03x04,She's totally hot and really fun.,Barney
03x04,But she has a dead tooth.,Barney
03x04,She's superhot and she's so successful.,Marshall
03x04,But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.,Marshall
03x04,She's so cute and she's so smart.,Lily
03x04,But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.,Lily
03x04,"Wow, set it up.",Ted
03x04,I'm still convinced she klled my turtle.,Ted
03x04,"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",Robin
03x04,"If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!",Barney
03x04,"Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.",Lily
03x04,"But? Lily: Fine, but he has a kid.",Ted
03x04,Oh.,Marshall
03x04,Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.,Ted
03x04,"But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.",Lily
03x04,Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.,Ted
03x04,I don't hate kids.,Robin
03x04,"You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.",Ted
03x04,"Robin, will you watch cartoons with me?",Little Girl
03x04,I go to school all week. Can't I just have five minutes to myself to read Highlights and drink my juice?,Little Robin
03x04,"OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.",Robin
03x04,"Well, you don't wanna have them.",Ted
03x04,I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vg1n,Robin
03x04,Shotgun.,Barney
03x04,"You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.",Marshall
03x04,Nice.,Barney
03x04,"You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.",Robin
03x04,"OK, that's awesome.",Lily
03x04,"Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...",Robin
03x04,But she's afraid of commitment.,Ted
03x04,But she's a gn nut.,Lily
03x04,But she's Canadian.,Barney
03x04,But she didn't like Field of Dreams.,Marshall
03x04,I can't think of anything.,Barney
03x04,You don't have a 'but'.,Ted
03x04,"OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.",Barney
03x04,Why?,Ted
03x04,The ultimate ice breaker.,Barney
03x04,"A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.",Barney
03x04,"So, what are the eye patches for?",Ted
03x04,We got bit.,Barney
03x04,On the eye? Barney: Yes.,Ted
03x04,Both of us.,Ted
03x04,They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!,Barney
03x04,"So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards...",Future Ted VO
03x04,"OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.",Robin
03x04,But?,Lily
03x04,Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.,Robin
03x04,"Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.",Lily
03x04,"I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.",Robin
03x04,"Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.",Lily
03x04,Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?,Robin
03x04,A good one. He won full custody.,Lily
03x04,"He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?",Robin
03x04,Don't tell anyone I said that.,Robin
03x04,"OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.",Ted
03x04,"Oh, Theodore...",Barney
03x04,"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.",Barney
03x04,"Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.",Ted
03x04,Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.,Barney
03x04,"Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.",Ted
03x04,Wow.,Barney
03x04,Wow. You're here and not in stall two.,Marshall
03x04,"Yeah, so?",Ted
03x04,I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.,Marshall
03x04,"OK, Marshall.",Barney
03x04,Yes.,Marshall
03x04,Which one of us has more game?,Barney
03x04,"Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",Marshall
03x04,"What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.",Barney
03x04,"Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.",Ted
03x04,"You're joking. I have mad game, bra.",Marshall
03x04,"OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.",Barney
03x04,"I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.",Ted
03x04,What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,Marshall
03x04,"Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",Barney
03x04,Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?,Marshall
03x04,"First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.",Ted
03x04,Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,Marshall
03x04,"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",Barney
03x04,Fine.,Ted
03x04,There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,Barney
03x04,Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,Ted
03x04,That's good too.,Barney
03x04,How about her?,Barney
03x04,You're on.,Ted
03x04,"Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",Barney
03x04,"OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.",Ted
03x04,"One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.",Marshall
03x04,Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.,Ted
03x04,"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",Ted
03x04,I win.,Barney
03x04,How?,Ted
03x04,"Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",Barney
03x04,"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.",Ted
03x04,I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,Barney
03x04,"Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.",Ted
03x04,"Ted, she's leaving.",Marshall
03x04,Get out of my way.,Ted
03x04,"By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",Barney
03x04,Look who's got game.,Marshall
03x04,"You're a big kids person, huh?",George
03x04,"Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.",Robin
03x04,Babies.,George
03x04,"Yeah, I like that kind.",Robin
03x04,"Well, Doug's almost six",George
03x04,"Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to...  I hate kids.",Robin
03x04,"Excuse me, what? Robin: I mean, I don't hate kids. I'm just not a kid person. I mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little, but beyond that, what's the draw? You must think I'm nuts.",George
03x04,"What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?",George
03x04,"Yeah, let's take things slow.",Robin
03x04,"And, kids, that's exactly what she did.",Future Ted VO
03x04,"Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear.",Future Ted VO
03x04,"Hey, what's up?",Lily
03x04,"It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?",Robin
03x04,"Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.",Lily
03x04,Who are you? Robin: I'm Robin.,Doug
03x04,That's a bird's name.,Doug
03x04,No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.,Robin
03x04,"My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code?",Doug
03x04,"Dude, I'm just reading my paper.",Robin
03x04,"Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal?",Doug
03x04,Sure.,Robin
03x04,"What are you doing? You're supposed to pour milk first? Robin: What? No, you pour the cereal first so you know how much milk you need.",Doug
03x04,It tastes better milk first.,Doug
03x04,It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.,Robin
03x04,Why are you wearing my dad's pants?,Doug
03x04,Milk first it is.,Robin
03x04,"What are you reading? Robin: The business section. The Fed's gonna lower rates again to bail out these subprime lenders, bunch of idiots.",Doug
03x04,Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.,Doug
03x04,"Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.",Robin
03x04,That's what I said. You're pretty cool.,Doug
03x04,You too.,Robin
03x04,"Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her.",Future Ted VO
03x04,"Well, have fun in yoga.",Ted
03x04,She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.,Ted
03x04,"Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.",Ted
03x04,You see this. Game face.,Ted
03x04,"Whatever, Ted.",Barney
03x04,"Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?",Ted
03x04,"Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.",Barney
03x04,"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have sx twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had sx a total of...wait for it...",Marshall
03x04,Nice.,Barney
03x04,"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sx and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.",Marshall
03x04,Doesn't count.,Barney
03x04,Totally counts.,Marshall
03x04,"You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had sx once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.",Ted
03x04,"OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.",Barney
03x04,"Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.",Ted
03x04,"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.",Barney
03x04,"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on.",Barney
03x04,"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",Ted
03x04,"Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.",Barney
03x04,Fine.,Ted
03x04,And I only stirred that with my pinky.,Barney
03x04,"Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.",Robin
03x04,"Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.",Lily
03x04,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.",Robin
03x04,What?,Lily
03x04,"Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",Robin
03x04,What?,Robin
03x04,"I hate to tell you this but, too late.",Lily
03x04,He drew it in class today.,Lily
03x04,Oh crap.,Robin
03x04,"There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.",Robin
03x04,You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.,Lily
03x04,We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me,Robin
03x04,That's totally you.,Marshall
03x04,You guys are totally crazy.,Robin
03x04,"Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?",Ted
03x04,It's not me.,Robin
03x04,"You're joking, right?",Marshall
03x04,It's not me.,Robin
03x04,My new mommy. Kinda has a nice ring to it.,Ted
03x04,"Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",Marshall
03x04,Do guys really think this is me?,Robin
03x04,"Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",Lily
03x04,Really?,Robin
03x04,"Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.",Lily
03x04,"Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.",Robin
03x04,"So, I, I had a really nice time tonight.",Stacy
03x04,Me too.,Ted
03x04,Yeah?,Stacy
03x04,Mm-hm.,Ted
03x04,"Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first.",Barney
03x04,"From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there.",Barney
03x04,"Uh, Ted, something wrong?",Stacy
03x04,"Hey, Doug.",Robin
03x04,Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower.,Doug
03x04,"Actually, I came to see you.",Robin
03x04,"I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.?",Doug
03x04,"Sure, why not?",Robin
03x04,"To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies.",Doug
03x04,"Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",Robin
03x04,"Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",Robin
03x04,Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.,Future Ted VO
03x04,"We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",Robin
03x04,"Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter.",Brooke
03x04,"I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie.",Brooke
03x04,What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy.,Robin
03x04,"So, this picture is not of me?",Robin
03x04,Why would I draw a picture of you?,Doug
03x04,How many dates has she been on with your dad?,Robin
03x04,Two.,Doug
03x04,"Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?",Robin
03x04,We just really connected.,Doug
03x04,And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.,Robin
03x04,"Why are you getting so upset, Roberta?",Doug
03x04,"Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?",Robin
03x04,Whatever.,Doug
03x04,"So, that's it, huh?",Robin
03x04,"Look, you're great, but...",Doug
03x04,"Yeah, there's always a 'but'.",Robin
03x04,"Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.",Ted
03x04,"Which Chumbawumba song? Barney: Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win.",Marshall
03x04,"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",Ted
03x04,That's what you think happened.,Barney
03x04,"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",Ted
03x04,Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,Barney
03x04,You are so sweet.,Stacy
03x04,"So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.",Barney
03x04,So you never slept with her?,Ted
03x04,Not even at all.,Barney
03x04,"Wow, that's good.",Marshall
03x04,It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?,Barney
03x04,"Well., have fun in yoga",Ted
03x04,Well?,Barney
03x04,Oh.,Barney
03x04,I'm sorry.,Stacy
03x04,"Stacy, right?",Barney
03x04,"Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?",Stacy
03x04,"Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?",Barney
03x04,I do.,Stacy
03x04,I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.,Barney
03x04,"Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.",Stacy
03x04,"No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.",Barney
03x04,After a while crocodile.,Ted
03x04,See you later alligator.,Barney
03x04,We are two peas.,Barney
03x04,"Wow, take care. Namaste.",Barney
03x04,You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.,Ted
03x04,"So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.",Barney
03x04,"Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches.",Barney
03x04,"No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...",Ted
03x04,"Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.",Barney
03x04,"Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.",Barney
03x04,I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.,Ted
03x04,I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.,Lily
03x04,"Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.",Robin
03x04,"Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours.",Future Ted VO
03x04,Hey.,Stacy
03x04,"You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.",Stacy
03x04,"That's what makes you so special, baby.",Barney
03x04,"Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy.",Stacy
03x05,"Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...",Future Ted VO
03x05,"Everyone, this is Blah-blah.",Ted
03x05,Please call me Blah.,Blah-blah
03x05,"So, Blah, how did you two meet?",Marshall
03x05,"Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.",Blah-blah
03x05,It was so magical.,Ted
03x05,Except it wasn't.,Future Ted VO
03x05,She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.,Ted
03x05,"Ay, Chihuahua.",Marshall
03x05,What? There's no stigma anymore.,Ted
03x05,"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.",Robin
03x05,"So, she's hot.",Barney
03x05,"Oh, she's gorgeous.",Ted
03x05,Then she's crazy.,Barney
03x05,No she's not.,Ted
03x05,"Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.",Barney
03x05,"OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.",Ted
03x05,There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.,Barney
03x05,She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.,Ted
03x05,"Wait, hot-crazy scale?",Robin
03x05,Let me illustrate.,Barney
03x05,A girl is allowed to be crazy...,Barney
03x05,... as long as she is equally hot.,Barney
03x05,"Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
03x05,"If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
03x05,You want the girl to be above this line,Barney
03x05,"Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...",Barney
03x05,...then lose ten pounds.,Barney
03x05,She'd stab me with a fork...,Barney
03x05,... then get a boob job.,Barney
03x05,I should give her a call.,Barney
03x05,"OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.",Ted
03x05,"I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...",Barney
03x05,She's not crazy.,Ted
03x05,"OK, we'll see.",Barney
03x05,"Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.",Blah-blah
03x05,It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.,Barney
03x05,You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.,Ted
03x05,"Yeah. Marshall: All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.'",Blah-blah
03x05,Aw.,Lily
03x05,Starts with it too.,Marshall
03x05,"When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance.",Future Ted VO
03x05,It was late August 1996,Lily
03x05,Lily and I were both freshmen moving into,Marshall
03x05,Hewitt Hall.,"Lily, Marshall"
03x05,And she needed some help setting up her stereo.,Marshall VO
03x05,"For some unknown reason, I felt drawn to room 110.",Lily VO
03x05,As if she knew that someone very special was behind that door.,Marshall VO
03x05,"And as fate would have it, that someone was Marshall.",Lily VO
03x05,It was love at first sight.,"Marshall, Lily VO"
03x05,Hi.,College Marshall
03x05,Hi.,College Lily
03x05,Ohhh.,Blah-blah
03x05,"I know, right?",Marshall
03x05,"Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different.",Future Ted VO
03x05,"Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today,  wanna tap that.",Marshall
03x05,"You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.",Blah-blah
03x05,Saw 'aw.',Blah-blah
03x05,Aw.,Everyone
03x05,"I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys.",Blah-blah
03x05,"Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.",Ted
03x05,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.",Robin
03x05,Really? Sixteen no's. Really?,Barney
03x05,"So, you're single.",Blah-blah
03x05,Yeah.,Robin
03x05,"Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.",Blah-blah
03x05,"You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.",Ted
03x05,"Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich.",Future Ted VO
03x05,"Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich.",College Guy
03x05,Hey.,College Ted
03x05,"Good afternoon, sir. I'm Marshall Eriksen. College Ted: Sir? Please, just call me Ted.",College Marshall
03x05,"OK, Dean Ted.",College Marshall
03x05,Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich.,College Ted
03x05,What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school.,College Marshall
03x05,"So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway.",College Ted
03x05,What do you mean?,College Marshall
03x05,I'm your new roommate. College Marshall: This is so unfair.,College Ted
03x05,I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.,Marshall
03x05,You're not the dean.,Marshall
03x05,"College, good times.",Robin
03x05,"Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.",Blah-blah
03x05,"Oh, here we go.",Barney
03x05,"Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.",Blah-blah
03x05,Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.,Barney
03x05,"These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?",Blah-blah
03x05,"Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?",Robin
03x05,"I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?",Blah-blah
03x05,"Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.",Robin
03x05,"Wow, that just came out of nowhere.",Blah-blah
03x05,"No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.",Robin
03x05,I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?,Blah-blah
03x05,"No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.",Robin
03x05,"Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.",Blah-blah
03x05,"You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.",Ted
03x05,"OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.",Barney
03x05,Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.,Barney
03x05,"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",Ted
03x05,"No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",Barney
03x05,"Oh man, I'm really sorry.",Ted
03x05,"Wow, you bought that?",Barney
03x05,"What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?",Ted
03x05,Ted.,Ted
03x05,"Are you a total idiot, Ted?",Barney
03x05,"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney:  Well played.",Ted
03x05,I like you Ted.,Barney
03x05,"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",Barney
03x05,Barney. We met at the urinal.,Barney
03x05,"Oh right, hi.",Ted
03x05,"Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",Barney
03x05,I'm not wearing a suit.,Ted
03x05,"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",Barney
03x05,"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",Barney
03x05,"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",Barney
03x05,"Edward, this is Audrey.",Barney
03x05,"You know, I actually know some sign language.",Audrey
03x05,"Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you",Audrey
03x05,He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,Barney
03x05,I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,Ted
03x05,What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,Barney
03x05,My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,Ted
03x05,Here. Call me.,Audrey
03x05,"And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",Barney
03x05,"Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",Ted
03x05,He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,Ted
03x05,"Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",Barney
03x05,"Oh my God, you told them.",Blah-blah
03x05,"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",Ted
03x05,"Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",Barney
03x05,"Wait, you guys dated. For how long?",Blah-blah
03x05,"A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about sx, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",Robin
03x05,"Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.",Blah-blah
03x05,"Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",Ted
03x05,"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",Barney
03x05,She started the night here,Barney
03x05,"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",Barney
03x05,Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kll me with a brick.,Barney
03x05,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",Ted
03x05,"Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.",Blah-blah
03x05,"I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.",Blah-blah
03x05,Their story is not as magical as it seems.,Ted
03x05,What do you mean?,Blah-blah
03x05,"No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",Ted
03x05,"Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.",Blah-blah
03x05,"The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",Ted
03x05,"Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.",College Ted
03x05,"Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.",College Lily
03x05,"No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.",College Ted
03x05,"Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.",College Lily
03x05,Chug chug chug chug,College students
03x05,"These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.",College Ted
03x05,"Oh, it's fruity.",College Lily
03x05,"Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.",College Ted
03x05,"So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?",College Lily
03x05,"Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know. You know?",College Ted
03x05,Wow.,College Lily
03x05,"As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",Ted
03x05,Oh my God.,Blah-blah
03x05,"Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",Ted
03x05,You have to tell Marshall.,Blah-blah
03x05,"If he heard that, it would destroy him.",Ted
03x05,"If you don't tell him, I will.",Blah-blah
03x05,"Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",Ted
03x05,Oh no.,Ted
03x05,"So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.",Blah-blah
03x05,I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.,Ted
03x05,"Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",Lily
03x05,"I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.",College Ted
03x05,"In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.",College Ted
03x05,"Ted, this is Lily.",College Marshall
03x05,"No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen.",College Ted
03x05,"Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",Ted
03x05,"That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.",Blah-blah
03x05,Tell us what?,Marshall
03x05,"Lily, will you help us get the next round?",Ted
03x05,"Ted, what's going on?",Lily
03x05,"She knows about us, about how we really met.",Ted
03x05,"Yeah, I know, I just told her.",Lily
03x05,"No, the real story.",Ted
03x05,"Ted, what are you talking about?",Lily
03x05,"Lily, come on.",Ted
03x05,Come on what?,Lily
03x05,"Lily, come on.",Ted
03x05,"Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.",Lily
03x05,"Lily, come on.",Ted
03x05,I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.,Blah-blah
03x05,What? Ted and I never made out.,Lily
03x05,"Yeah, we did.",Ted
03x05,"I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",Lily
03x05,What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Ted
03x05,That wasn't me.,Lily
03x05,"Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",Ted
03x05,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",Lily
03x05,"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.",Barney
03x05,It was right over there.,Barney
03x05,"Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",Barney
03x05,"I'm sorry, who are you again?",Marshall
03x05,"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.",Ted
03x05,"I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",Barney
03x05,"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",Ted
03x05,"No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",Barney
03x05,"So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",Ted
03x05,I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.,Marshall
03x05,"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",Barney
03x05,"How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.",Barney
03x05,"You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.",Marshall
03x05,"Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",Barney
03x05,Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.,Barney
03x05,That man is a god.,Barney
03x05,"For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.",Marshall
03x05,I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.,Barney
03x05,"Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?",Lily
03x05,"Yeah, of course, what's wrong?",Marshall
03x05,"Lily and Ted made out. What do you think of that, Robin? Marshall: What are you talking about? Lily: You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party?",Blah-blah
03x05,Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.,Marshall
03x05,And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?,Ted
03x05,Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.,Marshall
03x05,I'm too-much-tongue guy.,Ted
03x05,And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Lily
03x05,Worst superheroes ever.,Barney
03x05,"Baby, I am so sorry.",Lily
03x05,"I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.",Marshall
03x05,"Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.",Ted
03x05,"Are you sure? Marshall: If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.",Lily
03x05,"You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.",Blah-blah
03x05,I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
03x05,"Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.",Blah-blah
03x05,World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?,Barney
03x05,We should grab some coffee sometime...,Warrior Avatar
03x05,"Yes, we should.",Female Avatar
03x05,What's your name?,Warrior Avatar
03x05,Ted. What's yours?,Female Avatar
03x05,"Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.",Ted
03x05,"So, suffice it to say, Blah-blah did not turn out to be your mother. As for the girl I made out with at the party...",Future Ted VO
03x05,"...there wasn't a doubt in my mind, that was your Aunt Lily.",Future Ted VO
03x05,"But you know that magical story of how she and Uncle Marshall met, it was worth preserving, so I kept my mouth shut.",Future Ted VO
03x05,I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
03x05,Until our 20th college reunion when I ran into Alexa Leskies.,Future Ted VO
03x05,"So, Ted, remember the last time we were here?",Alexa
03x05,You and me? No idea.,Ted
03x05,"Ted, come on. Freshman year, we were both pretty drunk?",Alexa
03x05,That was you?,Ted
03x05,I know.,Lily
03x05,So I am not too-much-tongue guy.,Ted
03x05,Actually.,Alexa
03x05,No.,Ted
03x05,Look what I've confiscated from some kids.,Marshall
03x05,That is a fat sandwich.,Ted
03x05,"I know, right?",Marshall
03x05,"Chew chew chew chew, swallow.",Marshall
03x05,"It's all right, honey.",Marshall
03x05,Sandwiches are strong these days.,Lily
03x05,I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done.,Ted
03x05,"Baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage?",Marshall
03x05,"Dude, we're 42.",Lily
03x05,Where's my wife?,Ted

03x06,Oh my God! I can't believe it!,Marshall

03x06,"Yeah, it really is.",Ted
03x06,"Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby.",Barney
03x06,"Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.",Ted

03x09,Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.,Ted from 2030
03x09,No way! March does not have 31 days.,Barney
03x09,"Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge.",Marshall
03x09,General knowledge.,Ted  Robin
03x09,And we did it all the time.,Ted from 2030
03x09,"Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.",Lily
03x09,Corporal punishment.,Ted  Robin
03x09,"Because once you start, it's surprisingly hard to stop.",Ted from 2030
03x09,"Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth.",Marshall
03x09,Colonel stuck-in-my-teeth.,Ted  Robin
03x09,"But now, we were broken up,so when Marshall said...",Ted from 2030
03x09,"But after the first year,I get a major pay raise.",Marshall
03x09,"We just let it slide. You see, on the surface, Robin and I looked like we were doing great. But the truth is, trying to be friends with your ex is a lot harder than it looks. You can't be as candid as you used to be.",Ted from 2030
03x09,"So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced...  Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.",Ted
03x09,"But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.",Ted from 2030
03x09,I gotta go.,Barney

03x09,What?,Barney
03x09,I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.,Marshall
03x09,"yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?",Ted
03x09,"Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob.",Robin
03x09,"Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him.",Lily
03x09,"Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?",Robin
03x09,"Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.",Lily
03x09,"I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.",Robin
03x09,"I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,the real Thanksgiving? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?",Barney
03x09,Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.,Robin

03x09,Said what?,Marshall
03x09,Slapsgiving.,Barney
03x09,"Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday: Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps.",Marshall
03x09,"I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third.",Ted from 2030
03x09,slapcountdown.com.,Barney
03x09,no.,Barney
03x09,"No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.",Barney
03x09,How many days are in october?,Ted
03x09,"Uh, thirty.",Barney
03x09,"Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.",Ted
03x09,I like Halloween very much. Is nice.,Barney

03x09,"Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?",Barney
03x09,Slapsgiving.,Marshall
03x09,"That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?",Barney
03x09,"The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.",Lily
03x09,"Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...",Barney
03x09,Slapsgiving.,Marshall
03x09,"...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.",Barney
03x09,Really?,Marhall
03x09,"Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.",Barney
03x09,"And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand.",Marshall
03x09,"Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.",Robin
03x09,How old is he?,Ted

03x09,"Hey, sweetie.",Bob
03x09,Hi.,Robin
03x09,But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob.,Ted from 2030
03x09,"Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.",Bob
03x09,"Hey, man, how are you?",Ted
03x09,Good to meet you. Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with my parents.,Bob

03x09,What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.,Lily
03x09,"Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass.",Marshall
03x09,"How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?",Ted
03x09,Nothing but respect for that man.,Barney
03x09,"Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.",Lily
03x09,"For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.",Marshall
03x09,"Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?",Ted

03x09,"Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.",Ted
03x09,Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
03x09,"Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.",Robin
03x09,Is Bob coming?,Ted
03x09,"No, he went to see green day.",Robin
03x09,So it's...,Ted
03x09,...just the two of us.,Ted and Robin
03x09,Making pies.,Robin
03x09,Pies. They're things that friends make together.,Ted
03x09,"Yeah, they do.",Robin
03x09,Great.,Ted
03x09,Yeah.,Robin
03x09,"Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.",Ted
03x09,Yeah.,Robin
03x09,"I'm going to make a phone call.  Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.",Ted
03x09,"Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.",Barney
03x09,"Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...",Ted
03x09,"Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.",Barney
03x09,"You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?",Ted
03x09,"No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.",Barney
03x09,So you're not coming to make pies.,Ted
03x09,"No, no. Thank you, mr. President.  Sorry.",Barney
03x09,"After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays.",Ted from 2030
03x09,"Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?",Lily
03x09,"In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.",Marshall
03x09,"Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the kller does not grab a bullhorn and announce, Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness.",Barney
03x09,"Hey, ted.",Robin
03x09,"Hey, happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
03x09,"You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?",Robin
03x09,yep.,Ted
03x09,Great.,Robin
03x09,Marshall?,Ted
03x09,Lily?,Robin
03x09,Something really weird happened last night.,Ted and Robin
03x09,What do you mean something weird happened last night?,Marshall
03x09,"You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.",Ted
03x09,"So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.",Ted
03x09,"I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.",Ted
03x09,"Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...",Barney
03x09,You're still getting slapped.,Marshall
03x09,"I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.",Ted
03x09,I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.,Robin
03x09,"Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.",Lily
03x09,I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.,Robin
03x09,"Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.",Lily
03x09,And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.,Robin
03x09,"Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.",Lily
03x09,He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.,Robin
03x09,"Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?",Robin
03x09,"Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had sx seven times?",Ted
03x09,Ooh. terrible.,Barney
03x09,What?! I thought it would break the ice.,Ted
03x09,I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.,Robin
03x09,How do you respond to something like that?,Lily
03x09,Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?,Robin
03x09,"Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!",Ted
03x09,"Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?",Robin
03x09,Pecan pie? Why are we making that?,Ted
03x09,"Um, it's my favorite.",Robin
03x09,You're allergic.,Ted
03x09,I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.,Robin
03x09,So we're making a pie for Bob.,Ted
03x09,Yeah.,Robin
03x09,She's got you making pies for this guy?,Barney
03x09,Yeah.,Ted
03x09,That is a real slap in the face.,Marshall
03x09,"You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.",Ted
03x09,"Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.",Robin
03x09,Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?,Ted
03x09,I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?,Robin
03x09,Yes.,Ted
03x09,Why?,Robin
03x09,Because he's a thousand years old.,Ted
03x09,"No, Ted! What are you doing?",Lily
03x09,Right?,Robin
03x09,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,",Ted
03x09,Come on.,Robin
03x09,The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.,Ted
03x09,Ted...,Robin
03x09,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?",Ted
03x09,He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?,Robin
03x09,I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.,Ted
03x09,It's mean.,Robin
03x09,"Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?",Ted
03x09,"First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?",Robin
03x09,"Hey, that is...",Ted
03x09,And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?,Robin
03x09,"Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.",Ted
03x09,"Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.",Robin
03x09,I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.,Ted
03x09,"I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.",Robin
03x09,"me, too.",Ted
03x09,You guys slept together last night?,Barney
03x09,That is a terrible idea!,Lily
03x09,Horrible idea.,Marshall
03x09,"Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!",Barney
03x09,What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...,Lily
03x09,"You are correct, Sir.",Robin
03x09,...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...,Lily
03x09,That is a truth-fact.,Robin
03x09,...an event Ted is also attending.,Lily
03x09,kablammo.,Robin
03x09,Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!,Lily
03x09,"Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.",Robin
03x09,"Well, did you guys at least talk about it?",Lily
03x09,: There's office material...,Ted
03x09,I hear something burning...,Robin
03x09,"Clearly, we need to ignore this.",Ted
03x09,"Clearly, we need to talk about this.",Robin
03x09,You know? to save the friendship.,Ted and Robin
03x09,We need to talk.,Robin
03x09,Stuffed mushroom?,Ted
03x09,We need to talk about last night.,Robin
03x09,Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?,Ted
03x09,"Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...",Robin
03x09,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?",Ted
03x09,What?! you're crazy!,Robin
03x09,"We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.",Ted
03x09,Only because your hand was still around my waist.,Robin
03x09,"Oh, come on! You leaned into it.",Ted
03x09,I... leaned into it?,Robin
03x09,"Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.",Ted
03x09,"Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?",Robin
03x09,My on-base percentage was off the charts!,Ted
03x09,"Oh, no! The slap-petizers.",Marshall
03x09,"You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have sx again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?",Lily
03x09,"Um, most Thanksgivings.",Barney
03x09,"Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.",Marshall
03x09,"Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.",Lily
03x09,"Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.",Marshall
03x09,I'm not scared.,Barney
03x09,"Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.",Marshall
03x09,Please don't slap me.,Barney
03x09,"I'm sorry, what?",Marshall
03x09,"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!",Barney
03x09,"I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?",Marshall
03x09,"Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.",Barney
03x09,"Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.",Marshall
03x09,"Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!",Barney
03x09,But it's Slapsgiving.,Marshall
03x09,"No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!",Lily
03x09,What?!,Marshall
03x09,Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!,Barney
03x09,"What's up, dudes?",Bob
03x09,"Hey, bob.",All
03x09,"Baby,please... -no!",Marshall
03x09,"The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.",Lily
03x09,"Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches.",Bob
03x09,"Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?",Robin
03x09,Apparently not.,Ted
03x09,What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.,Robin
03x09,"We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.",Ted
03x09,"Well, maybe we should stop pretending.",Robin
03x09,Maybe we should.,Ted
03x09,So... what do we do now?,Robin
03x09,I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.,Ted
03x09,Okay.,Robin
03x09,Happy Thanksgiving.,Ted
03x09,"So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last.",Ted from 2030
03x09,"Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?",Barney
03x09,"No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words.",Marshall
03x09,Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.,Lily
03x09,"Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.",Marshall
03x09,"This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming...",Bob
03x09,And then a funny thing happened...,Ted from 2030
03x09,It's really a major buzz-kill.,Bob
03x09,Major buzz-kill.,Ted and Robin
03x09,"Oh, no...",Lily
03x09,I thought we were done with that?,Barney
03x09,I guess we're not.,Robin
03x09,Guess we're not.,Ted
03x09,"You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.",Ted from 2030
03x09,"Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.",Barney
03x09,"Barney, put it away.",Lily
03x09,"How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?",Barney
03x09,The slap will occur in ten..,Voice
03x09,"Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!",Barney
03x09,"Barney, put it away.",Lily
03x09,...six...,Voice
03x09,I will in... five...,Barney
03x09,"... five, four...",Voice
03x09,You can slap him.,Lily
03x09,...three...,Voice
03x09,"What?! Wait, you...",Barney
03x09,...two...one.,Voice
03x09,"That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights!  What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the blood rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.",Marshall
03x09,"Well, guys have fun.",Lily
03x09,This is gonna be majoy cleaner.,Ted
03x09,Major cleaner!,All
03x09,"Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?",Marshall
03x09,That's the general idea.,Robin
03x09,General idea.,All
03x11,Oh my god!,Lily and Marshall 
03x11,I have a tattoo!,Ted 
03x11,"oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!",Barney
03x11,a tramp stamp?!,Ted
03x11,"kids, too often in life, we make decisions that we're not prepared to live with.",Narrator
03x11,"Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer.",Ted
03x11,"oh, but Ted, if you get rid of the butterfly, how's everyone gonna know you're a stripper fron reno with daddy issues?",Lily
03x11,"yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back.",Ted
03x11,Stella?,Lily
03x11,Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.,Ted
03x11,what?,Barney
03x11,I asked her out.,Ted
03x11,"Ted, why would you do that?",All
03x11,what's matter with you?,Barney
03x11,What? What do you mean?,Ted
03x11,Dude... don't poop where you eat.,Barney
03x11,"oh, no, this doesn't count.",Ted
03x11,"If it's someone you see on a regular basis, and you can't avoid them...",Marshall
03x11,"and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.",Lily
03x11,"You've heard of the golden rule, right? love their neighbor?",Barney
03x11,"uh, actually, it's do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's from the bible.",Ted
03x11,"Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is love thy neighbor, ok?... Now the golden rule is love thy neigbor. But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor.",Barney
03x11,"Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me...",Ted
03x11,"Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?",Robin
03x11,"Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?",Marshall
03x11,Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
03x11,"yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair.",Ted 
03x11,"good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction.",Barney
03x11,It's true.,Barney
03x11,That's not even possible.,Marshall
03x11,12 of them.,Barney
03x11,There's no way.,Marshall
03x11,Here's your gin and tonic.,Wendy
03x11,Thanks.,Barney
03x11,O gosh! Look at that.,wendy
03x11,"Oh, hey! You must be our new neighbors. I'm Michael.",A man
03x11,and i'm laura.,A women
03x11,"Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah.",Marshall
03x11,Do you guys know any good brunch places around here?,Laura
03x11,We love brunch!,Lily
03x11,You must be Robin.,The host
03x11,yeah!,Robin
03x11,Curt the iron man irons. I'm gonna be doing sports.,The host
03x11,"Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete?",Robin
03x11,Hockey.,Curt
03x11,The attraction is instant and undeniable.,Barney
03x11,"But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them. Idiots! But still, you think, this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me. And that step 2! Bargaining.",Barney
03x11,I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.,Robin
03x11,"NO! no, no, don't do it!",All
03x11,"I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that.",Robin
03x11,"Robin, it's a mistake. Remember what happened with me and Marshall? The Gerards across the hall?",Lily
03x11,Michael and LAura. They're awesome. We're gonna invite them over for dinner.,Lily
03x11,"Oh no, no guys guys! Are you insane?",The others
03x11,"This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.",Ted
03x11,we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.,Lily
03x11,That's the couples version of dating.,Barney
03x11,"And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.",Robin
03x11,Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
03x11,I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress.,Barney
03x11,No! Don't do it!,The others
03x11,Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?,Barney
03x11,I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already.,Lily
03x11,"Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.",Robin
03x11,"Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other.",Barney
03x11,"Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to kll the bar.",Ted
03x11,Bar kller.,Robin
03x11,"Don't kll the bar, dude.",Marshall
03x11,"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Barney
03x11,And it was a huge mistake.,Barney
03x11,"yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.",Marshall
03x11,And it was a huge mistake.,Lily 
03x11,"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Robin
03x11,And it was a huge mistake.,Robin
03x11,"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Ted
03x11,"Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this.",Barney
03x11,"Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions.",Ted
03x11,You have a butterfly tramp stamp.,Robin
03x11,"We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.",Ted
03x11,That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.,Barney
03x11,Good night!,Barney
03x11,Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?,Wendy
03x11,Not at all.,Barney
03x11,Robin! I got 2 tickets to the rangers. Center ice. Want to go?,Curt
03x11,and then we discover the movers lost all our kitchen boxes. We don't have a single pot or pan.,Laura
03x11,Guess we're ordering take-out.,Michael
03x11,Want to have dinner with us tonight?,Lily
03x11,That was an intersting use of the beverage gn.,Wendy
03x11,Club soda can get anything off.,Barney
03x11,"It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!",Wendy
03x11,"hey, can i get a gin and tonic?",Barney
03x11,"See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.",Ted
03x11,"oh, i paid for it.",Barney
03x11,"But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.",Ted
03x11,"Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks.",Barney
03x11,"we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.",Robin
03x11,What the opposite of name-dropping?,Barney
03x11,"Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well.",Robin
03x11,That's what we thought.,Lily
03x11,And it's so conveniant. They're right across the hall. Say it's sunday and we want to have a brunch double date with someone.,Lily
03x11,We just go across the hall.,Marshall
03x11,And say we want to have a dinner party exploring the wine and cuisine of France's Loire Valley.,Lily
03x11,We just go across the hall.,Marshall
03x11,Say we want to play a game of charades...,Lily
03x11,"Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here.",Lily
03x11,That's what i thought.,Barney
03x11,"Dude, you got to flick it.",Marshall
03x11,you don't have...,Barney
03x11,"Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge.",Wendy
03x11,"Come on, guys, free nachos. What?",Barney
03x11,We like this bar.,Ted
03x11,"Don't kll the bar, dude.",Marshall
03x11,"Barney, we love this bar.",Ted
03x11,"Don't kll the bar, dude.",Marshall
03x11,This bar is like home to us.,Ted
03x11,Don't kll the bar.,Marshall
03x11,You're klling the bar.,Lily
03x11,I'm not klling the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling.  It's fiiine.,Barney
03x11,But it wasn't.,Barney
03x11,It's fine.,Marshall
03x11,But it wasn't.,Lily 
03x11,It's fine.,Robin
03x11,But it wasn't.,Robin
03x11,Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT.,Barney
03x11,"...but he should be back on the mound by spring training and that's sport. Back to you, Robin.",Curt
03x11,Thanks iron man we'll be right back.,Robin
03x11,and clear.,Productor
03x11,So you want to do something later?,Robin
03x11,"Oh, so you're talking to me now?",Curt
03x11,What are you talking about?,Robin
03x11,"I'm talking about last night. You said you'd call and you didn't. I missed you and i waited up, but you didn't call. That really hurts.",Curt
03x11,"oh, um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot.",Robin
03x11,I'm sorry Sweetie. I don't want to fight tonight. It's our first weekiversary.,Curt
03x11,"on my suggestion, you...",Marshall
03x11,"hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there.",Barney
03x11,What?,Wendy
03x11,over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me.,Barney
03x11,"Oh, okay, thanks sweetie.",Wendy
03x11,okay. All right.,Barney
03x11,"hey, neighbors.",Michael
03x11,We bought all the fixings for a mexican fiesta.,Laura
03x11,"um, well, we actually have tickets...",Lily
03x11,and no fiesta would be complete without,Michael
03x11,"Dude, actually, we made other plans, so... okay  one word. 2 syllables. Sounds like... parades: charades.",Marshall
03x11,charades!,Michael
03x11,What do you say?,Laura
03x11,Oh no!,All
03x11,which brings to step 6.,Barney
03x11,"Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.",Ted
03x11,Don't do this Ted.,Barney
03x11,You want to get out of the way?,Ted
03x11,Don't do this Ted. Don't,Ted
03x11,Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!,Ted
03x11,Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory.,Barney
03x11,"God, i'm such an idiot.",Robin
03x11,yeah.,Marshall
03x11,"Curt the iron man irons keeps leaving me love notes on post-its. On the teleprompter, on my desk, on the coffee-maker, on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker.",Robin
03x11,here's some sugar for my sugar.,Lily 
03x11,The iron man. oh!,Robin
03x11,I remember that.,Marshall
03x11,Ro! we are such idiots!,Marshall
03x11,Yeah!,Barney
03x11,"Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.",Lily
03x11,It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?,Marshall
03x11,"Hey neighbor! Hey, neighborHey neighbor.",Lily
03x11,I remember that.,Barney
03x11,How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?,Barney
03x11,oh you are kidding me?! What?!,All
03x11,Don't kll the bar dude!,Marshall
03x11,We said don't do it!,Lily 
03x11,tss,Barney
03x11,"You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?",Ted
03x11,"Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch.",Barney
03x11,"yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.",Ted
03x11,"Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!",Barney
03x11,"Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to.",Lily
03x11,Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson.,Robin
03x11,don't kll the bar dude.,Marshall
03x11,"And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION.",Barney
03x11,"Curt, we need to talk. I like you...",Robin
03x11,"guys, we like you a lot...",Marshall
03x11,I don't like you.,Barney
03x11,"We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade.",Robin
03x11,We're getting a little sick of charades.,Lily
03x11,"I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.",Barney
03x11,So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.,Robin
03x11,Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.,Marshall
03x11,"other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.",Barney
03x11,"Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?",Wendy
03x11,or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?,Barney
03x11,"And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT.",Barney
03x11,"And now, here's Curt the iron man irons with sports. Curt?  Curt?",Robin
03x11,"Well, the Knicks lost. It's sad, really. They had a real shot. Then, out of nowhere, game over. And why? Why Robin?",Curt
03x11,"Uh, well, their perimeter shting has been a little bit off this season...",Robin
03x11,"The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt. So they didn't even try. Well, you know what i think? I think the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with. Kincks suck!",Curt
03x11,And that's sports.,Robin
03x11,Do you see anything?,Lily
03x11,I think we're clear.,Marshall
03x11,ok go go go.,Lily
03x11,That was close.,Marshall
03x11,Too close.  You've got to be kidding me. What do we do?,Lily
03x11,I have no idea.,Marshall
03x11,"guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up?",Ted
03x11,It's just Ted!,Lily
03x11,Wait!,Marshall
03x11,Hello? Guys?,Ted
03x11,"Baby, we only have one choice.",Marshall
03x11,"Okay, hurry!  Michael and Laura are probably...",Lily
03x11,"Hey, neighbors.",Laura
03x11,"Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends.",Wendy
03x11,Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.,Barney
03x11,"If you need anything else, let me know.",Wendy
03x11,waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.,Ted
03x11,She's gonna try to kll me. This is poisoned.,Barney
03x11,What? You're being ridiculous.,Ted
03x11,Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to kll me and everyone close to me.,Barney
03x11,What are you talking about?,Ted
03x11,Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says no hard feelings. She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?,Barney
03x11,"Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?",Ted
03x11,Where did Marshall get that hamburger?,Barney
03x11,"I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.",Ted
03x11,Dude.,Marshall
03x11,You're welcome.,Barney
03x11,"Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?",Robin
03x11,Yet.,Barney
03x11,You're an idiot.,Robin
03x11,"All right, i'm taking off.",Ted
03x11,What?,Barney
03x11,I have a date.,Ted
03x11,You're such a jerk!,Ted
03x11,"Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.",Barney
03x11,"Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule.",Ted
03x11,"So Stella and i went on our date. But here's the funny thing: turns out, it wasn't actually a date.",Narrator
03x11,So what do you mean it wasn't a date?,Marshall
03x11,She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.,Ted
03x11,Why would she think that?,Marshall
03x11,Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?,Robin
03x11,"Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.",Ted
03x11,"Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.",Barney
03x11,"No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.",Ted
03x11,"Oh, sorry Ted.",Lily
03x11,It's okay. What are you guys watching?,Ted
03x11,"So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful.",Narrator
03x11,Thanks for watching.,Robin
03x11,Good night.,Curt
03x11,and you start to let go of it.,Narrator
03x11,Hey guys!,MarshallLily 
03x11,So what do you guys have going on tonight?,Lily
03x11,We're going to have a few friends over.,Laura
03x11,gonna play some charades.,Michael
03x11,Have fun.,Marshall
03x11,And move on with your life.,Narrator
03x11,It just takes a while.,Narrator
03x11,Thanks.  Crazy!,Barney
03x12,00 this afternoon.,"In fairness, I did call Ted's butt at, like, 2"
03x12,your mother was there.,"So on March 17, 2008, I went to a big St. Patrick's Day party. And it's a good thing I did, because, funny story"
03x12,"do bad things, good things happen.","Okay, it's official"
03x12,I don't see no ring on this finger.,First skipped message
03x12,Can you put it on my tab?,Next message
03x12,"I really want to hook up with you, leave before breakfast, and then never see you again.",Next message
03x12,...out of whack...,Next message
03x13,"Kids, sometimes in life you see someone and you just instantly know this is the person for you. It can happen anywhere. Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic. And that's what happened when I met..Stella.",Ted from 2030
03x13,"Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang.",Stella
03x13,"No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden...",Ted
03x13,"Well, I can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions, but, I should warn you, laser surgery's very painful.",Stella
03x13,"Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made.",Ted
03x13,"Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?",Stella
03x13,"No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate.",Ted
03x13,"Uh, I'm a doctor, went to medical school. It's Plan 9. If you don't believe me, it's playing down at the Pamela Theater.",Stella
03x13,"Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor.",Ted
03x13,"Well, what are you doing tonight?",Stella
03x13,"Hey, Ted.",Stella
03x13,"Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me.",Ted
03x13,"Oh, no, no, don't...",Stella
03x13,"Come on, I insist.",Ted
03x13,"That's so nice. Thank you. Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted.  He wants to pay.",Stella
03x13,"Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four.",Ted
03x13,Is something wrong?,"Woman 1, to Ted"
03x13,"No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.",Ted
03x13,What's wrong?,"Woman 2, to Woman 1"
03x13,Ted's embarrassed-- he thought this was a date.,"Woman 1, to Woman 2"
03x13,Ted thought this was a date.,"Woman 2, to Woman 3"
03x13,"Stella, did you know Ted thought this was a date?","Woman 3, to Stella"
03x13,What? I'm not allowed to date a patient. It's an AMA rule.,"Stella, to Woman 3"
03x13,She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule.,"Woman 3, to Woman 2"
03x13,She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule.,"Woman 2, to Woman 1"
03x13,She's not allowed to date...,"Woman 1, to Ted"
03x13,"Yeah, I got it.",Ted
03x13,We all got it. Ted's a schmuck.,Man
03x13,And you bought all the tickets.,Stella
03x13,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.",Ted
03x13,I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.,Stella
03x13,"No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.",Ted
03x13,"Well, then,fair warning: I'm going to say no.",Stella
03x13,"Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?",Ted
03x13,No.,Stella
03x13,Boyfriend?,Ted
03x13,No.,Stella
03x13,Lesbian?,Ted
03x13,No.,Stella
03x13,Only date black guys?,Ted
03x13,No.,Stella
03x13,"And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be...",Ted
03x13,No.,Stella
03x13,"No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.",Robin
03x13,This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?,Ted
03x13,"Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.",Marshall
03x13,"Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.",Barney
03x13,That's ridiculous.,Ted
03x13,Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.,Barney
03x13,Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up.,Stella
03x13,"So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.",Ted
03x13,"Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?",Robin
03x13,"I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails.",Lily
03x13,"But, baby, you love biting your nails.",Marshall
03x13,"I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard.",Lily
03x13,"Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that no into a yes.",Ted
03x13,"Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?",Barney
03x13,This is going to hurt a little.,Stella
03x13,"Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and...",Ted
03x13,"Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts. Everyone probably sounds like that.",Stella
03x13,"Doctor, are you all right? I heard a woman screaming in here. Oh.",Abby
03x13,Here's to nine more great sessions.,Ted
03x13,Weeks went by. The second session I told her about how I spent a summer working with inner-city kids. The third session we both spoke nothing but French. The fourth session I made her laugh so hard she fell out of her chair. So by the time the fifth session came around...,Ted from 2030
03x13,Still no.,Stella
03x13,"Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.",Ted
03x13,You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.,Barney
03x13,You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?,Ted
03x13,Magic's not lame.,Barney
03x13,I don't get it. I mean...,Ted
03x13,Is this lame?,Barney
03x13,"Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table.",Robin
03x13,What the hell is wrong with you?,Marshall
03x13,There's alcohol in here.,Robin
03x13,Barney...,Lily
03x13,I...,Barney
03x13,We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.,Lily
03x13,"Yeah, but Ted provoked me.",Barney
03x13,"No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.",Lily
03x13,But...,Barney
03x13,Go!,Lily
03x13,Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.,Ted
03x13,"You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.",Lily
03x13,Works for baboons. It's called presenting.,Marshall
03x13,I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.,Ted
03x13,"You can't turn a no into a yes, Ted. Can't be done.",Barney
03x13,"I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said yes eventually.",Robin
03x13,"No, you didn't. You were like, No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.",Barney
03x13,To Ted.,Robin
03x13,"Oh, right.",Barney
03x13,"Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle.",Ted
03x13,"Sir, please don't yell at me, because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying. Please don't do it.",Abby
03x13,"Abby, I've told you before.",Stella
03x13,...Please...,Abby
03x13,"When they're rude to you, hang up the phone.",Stella
03x13,...how difficult it is for me to...,Abby
03x13,"Go on, you can do this, hang up. Abby, hang it up.",Stella
03x13,I am too busy to waste my time...,Abby
03x13,"I'm sorry, I just wish that some of the patients would be nicer to you.",Stella
03x13,The receptionist. That's my way in.,Ted
03x13,I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.,Barney
03x13,That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?,Ted
03x13,Who?,Barney
03x13,Here's the plan.,Ted
03x13,"Hi. Here. I stopped...  Hi, I stopped for coffee and I... and I thought I'd grab you something.",Ted
03x13,"Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice. You're like a knight. I should call you Sir Ted.",Abby
03x13,What?,Ted
03x13,"Nothing. Nothing.  Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.",Abby
03x13,"Thanks. Thanks, Abby.",Stella
03x13,And now... we wait.,Ted
03x13,"And sure enough, by session seven, she saw me in a whole new light.",Ted from 2030
03x13,"Okay, I'm about to break my big rule here.",Stella
03x13,Break it.,Ted
03x13,"Okay. Abby goes bowling with her church group every Wednesday nights...and she really wanted to invite you, but she's too shy.",Stella
03x13,Abby is...?,Ted
03x13,"My receptionist. You really made quite an impression on her with the coffee the other day. I mean, she has really not stopped talking about you.",Stella
03x13,"Oh, Abby. I thought you said Alan.",Ted
03x13,"But you just said, Abby is...?",Stella
03x13,"Right. Right, I thought I said Alan.",Ted
03x13,Who's Alan?,Stella
03x13,Who's Abby?,Ted
03x13,My receptionist.,Stella
03x13,Exactly.,Ted
03x13,What is happening?,Ted
03x13,"Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks.",Lily
03x13,"You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick.",Ted
03x13,You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'.,Ted
03x13,"I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about.",Ted
03x13,It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory.,Marshall
03x13,Can I borrow your copy?,Ted
03x13,I left it somewhere... I forget.,Marshall
03x13,Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.,Ted
03x13,"Hi, Ted. I'll let her know.",Abby
03x13,Telepathically?,Ted
03x13,"That's funny. That's funny, smart, and great.","Abby, laughing"
03x13,"I am so sorry that I am late. I have, like, two minutes for lunch everyday.",Stella
03x13,"It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny...",Ted
03x13,"What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here.",Stella
03x13,"Oh, thank God.  I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, Get a life, people!",Ted
03x13,"Ted, I found your book.",Abby
03x13,What?,Ted
03x13,Your book 'The Power of Me'. I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage.,Abby
03x13,"What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life.",Ted
03x13,"No, you were reading it in the lobby.",Abby
03x13,"Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else.",Ted
03x13,"No, no, look right here. From the personal library of Ted Mosby. That's you.",Abby
03x13,"Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's nail the receptionist time.",Robin
03x13,I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.,Ted
03x13,"Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.",Barney
03x13,No. I like Stella.,Ted
03x13,"Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.",Barney
03x13,What do you mean?,Ted
03x13,"I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.",Barney
03x13,What? What is it?,Ted
03x13,"Hold on, I gotta pee.  Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?",Barney
03x13,What's the big secret?!,Ted
03x13,"Oh. Oh, right.",Barney
03x13,"Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.",Barney
03x13,"Sure, what's it regarding?",Abby
03x13,"Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like.",Barney
03x13,I-I don't understand.,Abby
03x13,"I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!",Barney
03x13,"Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying.",Abby
03x13,What are your credentials?!,Barney
03x13,Please don't do that. Please.,Abby
03x13,I want to know who am I speaking with!,Barney
03x13,"At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.",Barney
03x13,"Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?",Stella
03x13,No.,Abby
03x13,When am I going to kick this folliculaphilia?,Stella
03x13,Folliculaphilia?,Ted
03x13,Folliculaphilia.,Barney
03x13,What is that?,Ted
03x13,"Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.",Barney
03x13,That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.,Ted
03x13,"You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.",Barney
03x13,I know that you are because there's no such thing.,Ted
03x13,I got it a little bit.,Robin
03x13,"Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.",Ted
03x13,"Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache. You look like a young Tom Selleck, only a million times handsomer. Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you. Just kidding. Stupid.",Abby
03x13,Sorry I'm late. Typical two-minute lunch. So we are very close to getting...,Stella
03x13,Why? Just why?,Ted
03x13,Y-you don't remember?,Barney
03x13,I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.,Barney
03x13,Uh... okay.,Ted
03x13,You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?,Ted
03x13,"I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.",Barney
03x13,"This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.",Ted
03x13,"No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself.  I mean...",Lily
03x13,"Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too.",Ted
03x13,"I swear to you, I did not.",Lily
03x13,My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in?,Marshall
03x13,"You know, we should really get this mole checked out. It's just a little irregular.",Stella
03x13,"Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over.",Marshall
03x13,One of my patients has this little butterfly tattoo at the bottom of his back.,Stella
03x13,"Can you stop talking about your other patients?! I'm dying here, woman!",Marshall
03x13,"There you go. Look, even if it is something, it's easily treatable, so try to relax.",Stella
03x13,"Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?",Marshall
03x13,"Oh, that... that's nothing. It's just a little crush. So I will be calling you with your results.",Stella
03x13,Oh. Okay. Thank you.,Marshall
03x13,"Oh, sir, your book!",Stella
03x13,No.,Ted
03x13,Yes.,Marshall
03x13,She said crush? And she was talking about me?,Ted
03x13,That last session was the least painful of all. I savored every searing blast of that laser.,Ted from 2030
03x13,All done.,Stella
03x13,The moment I'd waited ten weeks for had arrived.,Ted from 2030
03x13,"Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me?",Ted
03x13,"Ted, you're a really nice guy...",Stella
03x13,"Oh, no.",Ted
03x13,It has been so great getting to know you.,Stella
03x13,I am gonna kll Marshall.,Ted
03x13,I've had so much fun these last ten weeks.,Stella
03x13,"Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser.",Ted
03x13,I have a daughter.,Stella
03x13,What?,Ted
03x13,"Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call.",Stella
03x13,There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.,Ted
03x13,"Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.",Marshall
03x13,I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.,Ted
03x13,You didn't actually say no.,Ted
03x13,What do you mean?,Stella
03x13,"All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?",Ted
03x13,Right.,Stella
03x13,"Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me?",Ted
03x13,Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter. Um... Okay.,Stella
03x13,Great. And... go. Taxi!,Ted
03x13,Hello!,Ranjit
03x13,"Ted, I seriously only have two minutes...",Stella
03x13,I know.,Ted
03x13,That's like 120 seconds.,Stella
03x13,"380 West 22nd, please. And step on it. We're in a hurry.",Ted
03x13,380 West 22nd? That's...,Stella
03x13,Right this way.,Ted
03x13,"Thank you, sir. You know, I have always wanted to try this place.","Stella, laughing"
03x13,House salad.,Waitress
03x13,"So, college?",Ted
03x13,Stanford.,Stella
03x13,Uh-huh. Wesleyan.,Ted
03x13,"Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?",Stella
03x13,No. Scott Crable?,Ted
03x13,Eggplant parmesean.,Waitress
03x13,Thanks.,Ted
03x13,"Oh, already cut up. Nice.",Stella
03x13,Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds.,Ted
03x13,Of course.,Waitress
03x13,"Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?",Ted
03x13,A little bit.,Stella
03x13,You can't tell at all.,Ted
03x13,"Oh, good. Yeah.",Stella
03x13,Hello!,Ranjit
03x13,384 West 22nd.,Ted
03x13,15 seconds. The movie's started.,Stella
03x13,"Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet.",Ted
03x13,"So, what are we seeing?",Stella
03x13,Manos: Hands of Fate.,Ted
03x13,The whole thing?,Stella
03x13,Only the important parts. Worst movie ever.,Ted
03x13,"Yeah, I almost walked out, like, five times.",Stella
03x13,How we doing on time? Taxi!,Ted
03x13,We got a little time.,Stella
03x13,Okay. Do you want to walk it?,Ted
03x13,Why not?,Stella
03x13,Hello! Good-bye!,Ranjit
03x13,So what grade's your daughter in?,Ted
03x13,Third grade.,Stella
03x13,Ah! That's a good year.,Ted
03x13,"Yeah, she's wonderful. I just wish that I could get her to quit smoking, you know?",Stella
03x13,What?,Ted
03x13,I'm kidding.,Stella
03x13,"Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?",Ted
03x13,"You know, this neighborhood just keeps on changing. This used to be a cute, little Italian restaurant.",Stella
03x13,"I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go.",Ted
03x13,"Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.",Stella
03x13,Flowers?,Ted
03x13,I'm allergic.,Stella
03x13,"Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time.",Ted
03x13,"Me, too, Ted.",Stella
03x13,And... date.,Ted
03x13,Huh?,Stella
03x13,"That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss.",Ted
03x13,I think I can be late just once.  Ted...,Stella
03x13,"Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?",Ted
03x13,Yes.,Stella
03x13,Okay.,Ted
03x13,"And that, kids, is how you turn a no into a yes.",Ted from 2030
03x13,"All my friends told me, Abby, be strong. He doesn't deserve another chance. But I forgive you!",Abby
03x13,"No, no, no, no!",Ted
03x13,...then he just kept toying with my emotions.,Abby
03x13,Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.,Barney
03x13,Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?,Abby
03x13,"Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?",Barney
03x13,My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.,Abby
03x13,We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.,Barney
03x13,"Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have sx on it and then go shopping.",Abby
03x13,I like you.,Barney
03x14,"Kids,back when we were younger, your Uncle Marshall and I were really into college basketball. Every year,March Madness would take over the entire apartment.",Ted from 2030
03x14,Hey.What's with the blackboard?,Robin
03x14,It's our NCAA bracket.,Ted
03x14,Big board equals big luck!,Marshall
03x14,"Hey, that looks familiar, where did you get it?",Lily
03x14,"Hello. Uh, I'm looking for my wife, Ms.Aldrin.",Marshall
03x14,There's no school today. It's Saturday.,Cleaner
03x14,Of course. How could I forget?,Marshall
03x14,Dumb ass.,Cleaner
03x14,Big board!,Ted
03x14,Big luck!,Marshall
03x14,"We found it. No big deal. Anyway, every year, Ted and I go in together on this big money pool out in Staten Island.",Marshall
03x14,"Yeah. The winner gets 100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.",Ted
03x14,And you get to keep the duffel bag.,Marshall
03x14,Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.,Lily
03x14,"That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.",Ted
03x14,Your team lost 20 minutes ago.,Barney
03x14,I didn't know they were playing today.,Ted
03x14,"You okay, Barney?",Lily
03x14,Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.,Barney
03x14,Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?,Robin
03x14,There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.,Barney
03x14,Of course there are.,Robin
03x14,"Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.",Barney
03x14,You could not be more evil.,Lily
03x14,"Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...",Barney
03x14,"Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.",Barney
03x14,I was only gone for a second when...,Barney
03x14,See? Skid-proof.,Barney
03x14,The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.,Barney
03x14,Pet store?,Marshall
03x14,"Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.",Ted
03x14,"God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.",Barney
03x14,I'm really bored at work.,Ted
03x14,"I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.",Barney
03x14,"Oh, I want to take her home right now.",Woman
03x14,"Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?",Barney
03x14,Jerk!,"Woman, slapping him"
03x14,"Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.",Barney
03x14,"Ooh, ooh, ooh!",Lily
03x14,Lily.,Barney
03x14,You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.,Lily
03x14,No. Marshall.,Barney
03x14,You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!,Marshall
03x14,Oh. No. Robin.,Barney
03x14,"You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.",Robin
03x14,"Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...",Barney
03x14,"At this point, about 83. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.",Barney
03x14,I'm so sorry.,Woman
03x14,"My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.",Barney
03x14,Why does this keep happening?,Barney
03x14,Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.,Lily
03x14,"Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.",Barney
03x14,But the next night got even weirder.,Ted from 2030
03x14,Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.,Barney
03x14,You never gonna believe what just happened.,Lily
03x14,"Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?",Barney
03x14,Alan Alda?,Lily
03x14,No.,Barney
03x14,"Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.",Mystery woman
03x14,"Oh, my God. Where is she?",Barney
03x14,She must have left. She...,Lily
03x14,"Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?",Barney
03x14,"She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.",Lily
03x14,Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?,Barney
03x14,Yes!,Lily
03x14,"That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!",Barney
03x14,"Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?",Barney
03x14,It's karma.,Lily
03x14,"Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.",Barney
03x14,"Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?",Ted
03x14,"My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.",Barney
03x14,I have one. It's called my marriage license.,Marshall
03x14,"Come on, let's see the list.",Ted
03x14,"Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.",Barney
03x14,"This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?",Barney
03x14,"I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.",Lily
03x14,How many of these girls know they're being photographed?,Ted
03x14,"All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.",Barney
03x14,"Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.",Lily
03x14,"Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.",Robin
03x14,Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.,Barney
03x14,"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.",Lily
03x14,This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,Barney
03x14,"The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.",Barney
03x14,"Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!",Lily
03x14,The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.,Lily
03x14,"It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!",Robin
03x14,It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!,Ted
03x14,"Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!",Robin
03x14,"Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.",Barney
03x14,12 hours to live!,"Marshal, Lily and Ted"
03x14,Damn it!,Robin
03x14,"Okay, toss up. Thought I was Jorge Posada, or You have my dead wife's kidney?",Barney
03x14,Kidney!,Ted
03x14,Jorge Posada!,Robin
03x14,She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!,Lily
03x14,That's true...,Barney
03x14,It's Dead wife's kidney. How are we even discussing this?,Marshall
03x14,Fake baby!,Lily
03x14,Lost at sea!,Marshall
03x14,Fake baby!,Ted
03x14,Lost at sea!,Marshall
03x14,I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.,Ted
03x14,"Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, Girl who thought I owned Google, up against the number seven seed, Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.",Barney
03x14,You got to go scuba instructor.,Ted
03x14,You're kidding me!,Robin
03x14,She got the bends!,Ted
03x14,"Yeah, she did.",Barney
03x14,Evil twin!,Marshall
03x14,Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!,Ted
03x14,"Barney, you're the tiebreaker.",Robin
03x14,I'm going with Evil Twin.,Barney
03x14,You're kidding me!,Ted
03x14,"Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.",Barney
03x14,Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.,Robin
03x14,Is that the blackboard from my classroom?,Lily
03x14,Come on! Marshall?,Barney
03x14,I'm tired and sad.,Marshall
03x14,Mosby?,Barney
03x14,"I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.",Ted
03x14,"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.",Barney
03x14,You guys stole my blackboard!,Lily
03x14,"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.",Barney
03x14,No.,Lily
03x14,What do you mean no?,Barney
03x14,"That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, I'm sorry.",Lily
03x14,"Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had sx with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.",Barney
03x14,"Barney, you're doing this.",Lily
03x14,"Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kll me!",Barney
03x14,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?",Lily
03x14,"If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.",Barney
03x14,What are you doing here?,Meg
03x14,"Look, Meg, we need to talk.",Barney
03x14,"It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.",Meg
03x14,And I forgive you. I love you.,Barney
03x14,"Oh, my God! I love you, too!",Meg
03x14,"No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...",Lily
03x14,"So you remember who this one is, right?",Barney
03x14,Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.,Lily
03x14,"Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...",Barney
03x14,"Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.",Lily
03x14,"Ah, there she is.",Barney
03x14,Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.,Lily
03x14,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",Barney
03x14,I'm making a scrapbook.,Lily
03x14,"Anna, hi.",Barney
03x14,"Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.",Anna
03x14,What Web site?,Barney
03x14,Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.,Anna
03x14,"You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.",Barney
03x14,"And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!",Ted from 2030
03x14,"Okay, which one is this again?",Lily
03x14,She's...,Barney
03x14,Larney! Die!,Kate
03x14,Is it her?,Barney
03x14,Die!,Kate
03x14,Smile.,Lily
03x14,You look good. Have you lost weight?,Barney
03x14,"We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.",Barney
03x14,"Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!",Holly
03x14,That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.,Lily
03x14,"But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.",Barney
03x14,She's gonna kll you.,Lily
03x14,Barney.,Holly
03x14,Holly.,Barney
03x14,"Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fianc. Mark.",Holly
03x14,Barney? You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?,Mark
03x14,So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?,Lily
03x14,"No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future.",Holly
03x14,"And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.",Mark
03x14,"Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.",Barney
03x14,Fourth of July? We started dating in June.,Mark
03x14,We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,Lily
03x14,"No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",Barney
03x14,"Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.",Robin
03x14,That's not a bad idea.,Barney
03x14,I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.,Robin
03x14,I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.,Ted
03x14,I do not.,Robin
03x14,Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?,Ted
03x14,"No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",Robin
03x14,I'm in.,Barney
03x14,"Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...",Robin
03x14,"...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.",Robin
03x14,"Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!",Barney
03x14,"And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.",Robin
03x14,"Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful.",Man
03x14,"I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.",Robin
03x14,"Hey, there, how are you doing?",Barney
03x14,"Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.",Robin
03x14,"Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?",Barney
03x14,"Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.",Robin
03x14,"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.",Barney
03x14,You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,Robin
03x14,"Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",Barney
03x14,"No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.",Robin
03x14,"Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have sx.",Barney
03x14,"Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.",Ted
03x14,I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands?  Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?,Marshall
03x14,I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,Barney
03x14,Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.,Marshall
03x14,Are you okay?,Ted
03x14,"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",Barney
03x14,"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",Lily
03x14,What? What?,Barney
03x14,"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",Robin
03x14,So I apologized for nothing?,Barney
03x14,"Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo Barney's Redemption. Could you stop giving me the finger?",Lily
03x14,"Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later.",Ted from 2030
03x14,"Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself.",Woman
03x15,"Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends.",Ted from 2030
03x15,A new car!,Ted
03x15,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",Barney
03x15,You can't call shotgun for eternity.,Robin
03x15,I just called it.,Barney
03x15,"You can't just call things, barney.",Robin
03x15,I call that I can call things!,Barney
03x15,"Hey, baby.",Lily
03x15,Beer.,Marshall
03x15,Are you okay?,Lily
03x15,Beer.,Marshall
03x15,"Okay, what happened?",Ted
03x15,They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at wr...,Marshall
03x15,"...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",Marshall
03x15,"Dude, we're lawyers now.",Man
03x15,Totally.,Marshall
03x15,We've got briefcases and everything.,Man
03x15,Freakin' briefcases.,Marshall
03x15,You have anything in yours?,Man
03x15,Totally empty. you?,Marshall
03x15,Candy bars.,Man
03x15,Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...,Marshall
03x15,"Hey, Marshall....",Arthur
03x15,"...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",Marshall
03x15,"Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... atillery arthur.",Marshall
03x15,How's your morning going?,Arthur
03x15,It's going fine. How is yours?,Marshall
03x15,"Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?",Arthur
03x15,"He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",Marshall
03x15,"That's great... have a good one, buddy.",Arthur
03x15,"You, too.  You never know who's gonna get hit...",Marshall
03x15,"Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!",Arthur
03x15,"It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",Marshall
03x15,Did you hear that?,Ferguson
03x15,"Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
03x15,Can you believe he did that On Take-your-daughter-to-work day?,Ferguson
03x15,"So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...",Marshall
03x15,"Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like the ninja report?",Ted
03x15,"Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in the ninja report yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",Marshall
03x15,"Hey, Ferguson.",Arthur
03x15,"Hey, Arthur.",Ferguson
03x15,How's your day going?,Arthur
03x15,I gotta go.,Marshall
03x15,Great. how is yours?,Ferguson
03x15,"Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?",Arthur
03x15,"Oh, thank god. Yeah, he's right in there.",Ferguson
03x15,"Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.",Arthur
03x15,And then...,Marshall
03x15,He screamed at me.,Marshall
03x15,"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",Lily
03x15,"What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",Barney
03x15,"Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",Marshall
03x15,"Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",Ted
03x15,"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",Barney
03x15,"Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",Lily
03x15,"Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",Robin
03x15,"Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",Marshall
03x15,All of what?,Ted
03x15,"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even atillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",Marshall
03x15,I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,Marshall
03x15,"Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",Barney
03x15,Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,Barney
03x15,"I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",Marshall
03x15,Is boy the right word?,Robin
03x15,"I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",Marshall
03x15,"God, you're hot right now.",Lily
03x15,"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",Marshall
03x15,Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,Barney
03x15,How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,Marshall
03x15,Here's what I would do if I were you.,Robin
03x15,"Hi, Arthur.",Robin
03x15,"Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?",Arthur
03x15,"Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",Robin
03x15,"Please, I have a family.",Arthur
03x15,So we good?,Robin
03x15,We're so good.,Arthur
03x15,Then why are you still in my office?,Robin
03x15,"Okay, gn violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",Ted
03x15,"Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",Marshall
03x15,Observe.,Ted
03x15,Arthur?,Ted
03x15,"What do you want, Marshall?",Arthur
03x15,"Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",Ted
03x15,You are nailing this.,Arthur
03x15,"Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",Ted
03x15,"You got me hooked, reel me in.",Arthur
03x15,There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,Ted
03x15,Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.,Arthur
03x15,"Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",Marshall
03x15,"Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",Ted
03x15,"It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",Marshall
03x15,"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",Barney
03x15,"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",Barney
03x15,"You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...",Bilson
03x15,"You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.",Blauman
03x15,"Oh, snap.",Barney
03x15,What?,Bilson
03x15,"You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?",Blauman
03x15,"Oh, my God.",Ted
03x15,He peed on the conference table?,Marshall
03x15,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.",Blauman
03x15,Does this help?,Barney
03x15,"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",Barney
03x15,That's it? that's the end of the story?,Marshall
03x15,"No, no, of course not... he died.",Barney
03x15,"How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",Marshall
03x15,"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",Barney
03x15,Chain of screaming?,Marshall
03x15,"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",Barney
03x15,I thought it was a chain of screaming.,Ted
03x15,"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",Barney
03x15,I don't scream at Lily.,Marshall
03x15,"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",Lily
03x15,So it's not a circle.,Robin
03x15,"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",Barney
03x15,"Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",Marshall
03x15,"Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",Lily
03x15,"Oh, God.",Barney
03x15,"...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",Lily
03x15,"Hello, Arthur.",Lily
03x15,"Hello, Marshall.",Arthur
03x15,"I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",Lily
03x15,"Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.",Arthur
03x15,"Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",Lily
03x15,"Oh, yeah.",Arthur
03x15,I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,Lily
03x15,That's it.,Arthur
03x15,...just throw her on the bed...,Lily
03x15,That's where she belongs.,Arthur
03x15,...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!,Lily
03x15,"It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",Lily
03x15,"You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",Marshall
03x15,I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...,Lily
03x15,"No, the other part, please.",Marshall
03x15,"I have the ninja report right here, but...",Lily
03x15,"And it seemed like that was the end of it, but it wasn't, because the next night...",Ted from 2030
03x15,"Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",Lily
03x15,"Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",Ted
03x15,"Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",Marshall
03x15,"Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",Ted
03x15,"Not good, not good at all.",Marshall
03x15,Where are you right now?,Ted
03x15,"Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.",Marshall
03x15,"Okay, I'll see you soon.",Ted
03x15,I love you.,Marshall
03x15,"I love you, too.",Ted
03x15,"Wow, you two are already saying the l word, huh?",Lily
03x15,Apparently.,Ted
03x15,You hitting that?,Lily
03x15,"I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",Marshall
03x15,"Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",Ted
03x15,"I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.",Marshall
03x15,"It's just, this is a really good parking spot.",Ted
03x15,Dude!,Marshall
03x15,"Look, just tell me what happened first.",Ted
03x15,"Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",Marshall
03x15,"There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",Ted
03x15,"After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",Marshall
03x15,"Hey, marshall.",Barney
03x15,How long have you been sitting there?,Marshall
03x15,"If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?",Barney
03x15,"Yeah, I was just about to order.",Marshall
03x15,What do you want?,Barney
03x15,A sandwich and gravy fries.,Marshall
03x15,"Okay, friends, what do you like?",Waiter
03x15,"A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.",Barney
03x15,Very good.,Waiter
03x15,"No, I didn't want meatloaf.",Marshall
03x15,"Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.",Barney
03x15,"No, I don't.",Marshall
03x15,"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",Barney
03x15,Who would I even scream at?,Marshall
03x15,I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,Barney
03x15,No.,Marshall
03x15,"Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?",Robin
03x15,"Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.",Marshall
03x15,"Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?",Robin
03x15,Is that ice cream cone big enough?,Ted
03x15,"Uh, it's delicious enough.",Robin
03x15,"Okay, so... Then I say to Barney...",Marshall
03x15,"I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.",Marshall
03x15,"Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.",Barney
03x15,"One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.",Waiter
03x15,Marshall.,Barney
03x15,Excuse me?,Marshall
03x15,Yes?,Waiter
03x15,This is not what I ordered.,Marshall
03x15,"Yes, it is.",Waiter
03x15,"I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so...",Marshall
03x15,"No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!",Waiter
03x15,"Hey, what are you guys doing out here?",Barney
03x15,"Oh sweet, can I get a toot?",Robin
03x15,"Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!",Ted
03x15,"Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.",Barney
03x15,"Well, that's just not true.",Ted
03x15,"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.",Barney
03x15,You can't call shotgun for eternity.,Robin
03x15,"Well, that's funny, cause I did!",Barney
03x15,It's case by case.,Robin
03x15,"Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!",Marshall
03x15,"A 20 tip, really, for that waiter?",Barney
03x15,"I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...",Marshall
03x15,"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.",Barney
03x15,What?,Marshall
03x15,Yell at me.,Barney
03x15,"I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.",Marshall
03x15,"What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot.",Barney
03x15,"Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?",Marshall
03x15,Yeah.,Barney
03x15,"This is me yelling at you, Barney.",Marshall
03x15,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.",Barney
03x15,"This is me yelling at you, Barney!",Marshall
03x15,"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.",Barney
03x15,You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!,Marshall
03x15,"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.",Barney
03x15,Your mom's a slut!,Marshall
03x15,Yes.,Barney
03x15,"Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!",Marshall
03x15,Keep going.,Barney
03x15,I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!,Marshall
03x15,"Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.",Barney
03x15,"Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...",Marshall
03x15,"No, I'm kidding... keep going.",Barney
03x15,"Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...",Marshall
03x15,"... I quit, Arthur! I quit!",Marshall
03x15,"Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that.",Arthur
03x15,"Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...",Marshall
03x15,"No, no, no, the part where you said, I quit. Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.",Arthur
03x15,"Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...",Ted
03x15,Dude!,Marshall
03x15,I'm sorry.,Ted
03x15,"Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.",Barney
03x15,"How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?",Marshall
03x15,"Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!",Ted
03x15,"Ted, screaming never solves anything.",Barney
03x15,And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.,Ted from 2030
03x15,"I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.",Marshall
03x15,"No, you're not.",Lily
03x15,What?,Marshall
03x15,"Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.",Lily
03x15,I love you.,Marshall
03x15,"I love you, too.",Lily
03x15,"Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet without going bust on the apartment.",Ted from 2030
03x15,You sure about this?,Marshall
03x15,"Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?",Ted
03x15,"Ted, I don't think I can accept...",Marshall
03x15,"Marshall, don't make me scream at you.",Ted
03x15,"Thanks a lot, buddy.",Marshall
03x15,"You guys did it in the car, didn't...",Ted
03x15,"Oh, yeah!",Marshall
03x16,"Now kids, When aunt Robin was the teenager. She was, well, the Canadian pop star. But by 2008, she was the entirely different person.",Ted from 2030
03x16,"Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to kll you?'",Robin
03x16,"Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising.",Ted from 2030
03x16,"So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.",Ted
03x16,"I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?",Robin
03x16,Totally. What's the occasion?,Lily
03x16,And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.,Robin
03x16,Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?,Barney
03x16,"No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.",Robin
03x16,Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.,Robin
03x16,"Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?",Barney
03x16,"So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?",Marshall
03x16,"No, it wasn't like that.",Robin
03x16,"Sounds to me like he gave you your first O, Canada! face.",Barney
03x16,This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted...,Ted from 2030
03x16,"Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit?",Lily
03x16,"...others were crude, and ill-formed...",Ted from 2030
03x16,"Um, something about fur trapping.",Ted
03x16,"...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...",Ted from 2030
03x16,Did you ride his Zamboni?,Barney
03x16,"Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out.",Marshall
03x16,"Yeah, I'm also oot. Okay, now I'm really out.",Ted
03x16,"Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.",Robin
03x16,Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.,Barney
03x16,"Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...",Robin
03x16,"Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out.",Robin
03x16,"Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. So, that everything? All right. Listen, babe... It's over.",Simon
03x16,What?,Robin
03x16,I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.,Simon
03x16,Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.,Lily
03x16,"Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh?",Marshall
03x16,"Well, the thing is... her folks just put in a pool.",Simon
03x16,"Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go.",Robin
03x16,"Uh... Babe, wait.",Simon
03x16,"Yeah, Simon?",Robin
03x16,You forgot to load the drum set.,Simon
03x16,No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.,Ted
03x16,I did.,Robin
03x16,"And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?",Marshall
03x16,"Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?",Lily
03x16,I have no idea what you' talking about.,Robin
03x16,"Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.",Ted
03x16,"Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.",Robin
03x16,You're starting out with two big ones right there.,Barney
03x16,"Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.",Robin
03x16,Point Robin.,Ted
03x16,"Um, he never became a rock star.",Robin
03x16,Point Robin.,Lily
03x16,He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.,Robin
03x16,Point Simon.,Marshall
03x16,Wait. Do they have a wave pool?,Ted
03x16,No.,Robin
03x16,Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.,Marshall
03x16,"Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.",Robin
03x16,"And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody.",Ted from 2030
03x16,"Hey, babe.",Simon
03x16,"Oh, my God.","Robin, giggling"
03x16,"Okay, what the hell just happened?",Ted
03x16,"Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?",Robin
03x16,"Hey, Simon.",Robin
03x16,"Wow, look at you. You got old.",Simon
03x16,"Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.",Robin
03x16,"So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.",Robin
03x16,Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing.,Simon
03x16,"So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.",Robin
03x16,"The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.",Marshall
03x16,"So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.",Lily
03x16,"No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.",Robin
03x16,"I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?",Barney
03x16,"Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park.",Simon
03x16,Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.,Ted
03x16,"Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it.",Simon
03x16,Um... ... okay. Go.,Ted
03x16,You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.,Simon
03x16,"No, I didn't know...",Ted
03x16,Another kid just went; he died too.,Simon
03x16,"Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...",Ted
03x16,"Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in: My friend, Ted, just klled a bunch of kids today.",Simon
03x16,"Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?",Lily
03x16,"Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding.",Simon
03x16,The Foreskins are still playing?,Robin
03x16,The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?,Ted
03x16,"Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously.",Simon
03x16,I know. I'm sorry.,Robin
03x16,"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.",Robin
03x16,Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,Barney
03x16,"So, Simon, how did you guys meet?",Barney
03x16,"Oh, I was in her video.",Simon
03x16,Starred in it is more like it.,Robin
03x16,"Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.",Simon
03x16,"I'm sorry. I've seen Let's Go to the Mall about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.",Barney
03x16,"No, I was in the other one.",Simon
03x16,There's another video?!,Barney
03x16,"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.",Barney
03x16,No.,Robin
03x16,"All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.",Barney
03x16,Okay.,Robin
03x16,"It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.",Marshall
03x16,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.",Robin
03x16,"Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.",Ted
03x16,It's called revertigo.,Marshall
03x16,"Yeah, I don't know about revertigo.",Ted
03x16,"You know who gets really bad revertigo?  Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.",Marshall
03x16,Michelle? She sounds hot.,Barney
03x16,You don't know about Lily and Michelle?,Ted
03x16,No. What about Lily and Michelle?,Barney
03x16,"Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?",Marshall
03x16,What?,Lily
03x16,"You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.",Marshall
03x16,"Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.",Lily
03x16,What...  Do they make out?,Barney
03x16,Better.,Marshall
03x16,Comparable.,Ted
03x16,Comparable.,Marshall
03x16,"Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.",Robin
03x16,I got a second chance.,Robin
03x16,What happened?,Lily
03x16,He came by my place tonight...,Robin
03x16,Simon. What are you doing here?,Robin
03x16,I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.,Simon
03x16,"Oh, I like where this is going.",Robin
03x16,"I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?",Simon
03x16,"He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.",Lily
03x16,The coup de grace.,Ted
03x16,Finish him!,Barney
03x16,I'd love to!,Robin
03x16,Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?,Ted
03x16,"Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.",Lily
03x16,"That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?",Robin
03x16,"Oh, hell, no!",Lily
03x16,I think you're gonna enjoy this.,Marshall
03x16,That my girl Michelle?,Lily
03x16,"Bitch, you know it!",Michelle
03x16,How she livin'?,Lily
03x16,She living only way she know how to. Large!,Michelle
03x16,"Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.",Lily
03x16,I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.,Michelle
03x16,For reals.,Lily
03x16,"I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.",Barney
03x16,Yeah!,Robin
03x16,"Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?",Simon
03x16,That rocked.,Robin
03x16,"Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.",Simon
03x16,"Oh, uh, sure.",Robin
03x16,"Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later.",Simon
03x16,"Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.",Robin
03x16,"Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show.",Simon
03x16,"Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.",Robin
03x16,"Right. So you can be, like Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out. And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs.",Simon
03x16,"And now it's time for Puppy Corner, some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.",Robin
03x16,"Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kll them.",Robin
03x16,"Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.",Marshall
03x16,What's revertigo?,Lily
03x16,"It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.",Ted
03x16,"No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.",Marshall
03x16,Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,Lily
03x16,You do?,Marshall
03x16,Yeah. Ted.,Lily
03x16,Me?,Ted
03x16,"Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.",Lily
03x16,"Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.",Ted
03x16,"Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?",Ted
03x16,"'Sup, Shmosby?!",Punchy
03x16,You want to go?,Ted
03x16,I'm already there!,Punchy
03x16,"Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.",Ted
03x16,"Yeah, it was a real shock.",Punchy
03x16,"I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.",Ted
03x16,Why?,Lily
03x16,No reason.,Ted
03x16,"Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?",Marshall
03x16,"Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.",Robin
03x16,"Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.",Lily
03x16,"You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?",Robin
03x16,I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?,Lily
03x16,That's exactly what my mom would say.,Robin
03x16,"No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, We forbid you from seeing this boy.",Lily
03x16,Lily!,Robin
03x16,"No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.",Lily
03x16,This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!,Robin
03x16,"Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.",Marshall
03x16,"Yeah, like, a billion years ago.",Robin
03x16,"You've been drinking, haven't you?",Lily
03x16,"Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.",Robin
03x16,You're not going to that show tonight!,Lily
03x16,"Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.",Robin
03x16,"Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.",Lily
03x16,"Hey, so, today at work...",Ted
03x16,"Not now, Ted!",Marshall
03x16,Geez.,Ted
03x16,"Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.",Robin
03x16,Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!,Simon
03x16,"God, I just love seeing you so happy.",Robin
03x16,"Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over.",Simon
03x16,What?,Robin
03x16,I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.,Simon
03x16,What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason?,"Robin, laughing"
03x16,"Well... I'm sorry, Robin.",Ted
03x16,"I'm fine, really.",Robin
03x16,"Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?",Lily
03x16,"Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub.",Michelle
03x16,Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.,Lily
03x16,"So, how's Columbia?",Ted
03x16,Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.,Michelle
03x16,"Um, can I make an observation?",Robin
03x16,"Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.",Michelle
03x16,Revertigo?,Marshall
03x16,"No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!",Michelle
03x16,"One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.",Ted from 2030
03x16,All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?,Barney
03x16,Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.,Robin
03x16,"Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.",Barney
03x16,"No, tonight.",Robin
03x16,"Ooh. Really? Oh! Oh, come here.",Barney
03x16,"It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.",Robin
03x16,"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",Barney
03x16,"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",Robin
03x16,No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,Barney
03x16,"Barney, do you want to come back to my place?",Robin
03x16,Your place?,Barney
03x16,Are you sure you want to do this?,Barney
03x16,"Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",Robin
03x16,"Of course. So, should I just put it in?",Barney
03x16,"Yeah, why not?",Robin
03x16,This was my big artistic follow-up toLet's Go to the Mall. It kind of tanked.,Robin
03x16,Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,Barney
03x16,"Oh, I'm so glad.",Robin
03x16,Is that Alan Thicke?,Barney
03x16,Yeah.,Robin
03x16,"You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",Barney
03x16,"Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",Robin
03x16,"Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",Barney
03x16,He was my sidekick. He had to be.,Robin
03x16,And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally...  they stopped watching.,Ted from 2030
03x17,"Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed.",Ted from 2030
03x17,"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",Barney
03x17,Check.,Robin
03x17,"Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",Barney
03x17,"And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?",Robin
03x17,"Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",Barney
03x17,And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,Robin
03x17,Best friend.,Barney
03x17,"Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",Robin
03x17,"Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",Barney
03x17,Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,Robin
03x17,"Okay. Right. So, Robin?",Barney
03x17,"Yes, Barney?",Robin
03x17,Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,Barney
03x17,"I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",Robin
03x17,Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,Barney
03x17,But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.,Ted from 2030
03x17,"So, tell us, what was it like?",Ted
03x17,What?,Barney
03x17,"Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",Ted
03x17,I... I... I'm... I'm...,Barney
03x17,"Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.",Marshall
03x17,"Yeah, you are.",Robin
03x17,"Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",Marshall
03x17,"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",Lily
03x17,What are you talking about?!,Barney
03x17,"The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",Ted
03x17,"Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, try again. How you doing there, Robin?",Barney
03x17,I'm good.,Robin
03x17,"Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",Ted
03x17,"Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?",Barney
03x17,Liking video games?,Ted
03x17,I'm gonna get a drink.,Robin
03x17,I'll come with you.,Barney
03x17,Okay.,Robin
03x17,"God, this is awkward.",Barney
03x17,What is?,Robin
03x17,Being around Ted.,Barney
03x17,Why?,Robin
03x17,Because of our thing.,Barney
03x17,What thing?,Robin
03x17,You're really gonna pretend this never happened?,Barney
03x17,What never happened? What are you guys talking about?,Ted
03x17,Nothing.,Robin
03x17,"Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.",Ted
03x17,"Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.",Barney
03x17,Hello.,Marshall
03x17,"Hey, Marshall, I need your help.",Barney
03x17,"Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.",Marshall
03x17,I know. I want to hire you.,Barney
03x17,"For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.",Marshall
03x17,I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.,Barney
03x17,How much?,Marshall
03x17,A little.,Barney
03x17,I'll take it.,Marshall
03x17,"Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at wr with Portugal.",Marshall
03x17,"Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",Barney
03x17,Of course. Why are you upset?,Marshall
03x17,"Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.",Barney
03x17,"No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...",Marshall
03x17,"You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept...  I slept... I slept with Robin.",Barney
03x17,You slept with Robin?,Marshall
03x17,Are you mad at me?,Barney
03x17,I don't know.,Marshall
03x17,How's the hot dog?,Barney
03x17,"It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.",Marshall
03x17,You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,Barney
03x17,Why are you doing this to me?!,Marshall
03x17,"Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.",Barney
03x17,"How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?",Marshall
03x17,"I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.",Barney
03x17,"For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic.",Ted from 2030
03x17,Bro Code article one:Bros before hoes.,Barney
03x17,Some were unbelievably complicated.,Ted from 2030
03x17,"Bro Code article 89: The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing.",Barney
03x17,And some were just plain disturbing.,Ted from 2030
03x17,Bro Code article 34: Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way. Two dudes.,Barney
03x17,This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.,Marshall
03x17,"You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?",Barney
03x17,The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.,Barney
03x17,"But, bro, seriously, I called the dibs on that wench. You codpiece blocked me.",Benjamin
03x17,So what if I did? There's no rule against it.,George
03x17,"Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros.",Benjamin
03x17,"But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.",George
03x17,And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.,Benjamin
03x17,I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.,Barney
03x17,It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.,George
03x17,And I shall l include a provision that stateth No eye contact in a devil's three-way.,Barney
03x17,Seconded.,Benjamin
03x17,Seconded.,George
03x17,"Listen, what do you want me for?",Marshall
03x17,"I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?",Barney
03x17,"Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",Marshall
03x17,"No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states No sx with your bro's ex. But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",Barney
03x17,And you would pay me for that?,Marshall
03x17,"No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",Barney
03x17,"Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",Marshall
03x17,"Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",Barney
03x17,"While Marshall examined the Bro Code, Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.",Ted from 2030
03x17,"And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?",Lily
03x17,"You got it, toots.",Frank
03x17,Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.,Lily
03x17,Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?,Girl
03x17,"Oh! Ah, isn't that sweet! Well, you know, honey, right after this, I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop. And they're going to take a great big knife...",Frank
03x17,And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.,Ted from 2030
03x17,"Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.",Girl
03x17,"I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.",Lily
03x17,"Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?",Ted
03x17,I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.,Lily
03x17,"Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.",Ted
03x17,"And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat would go on to do in that bathroom was so... No, you know what? I'm m getting ahead of myself. We'll get there.",Ted from 2030
03x17,"Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?",Robin
03x17,How'd you know that was a goat turd?,Ted
03x17,"Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?",Robin
03x17,Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.,Ted
03x17,Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.,Marshall
03x17,Talk about what?,Ted
03x17,"Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?",Marshall
03x17,How does everyone know that's a goat turd?,Ted
03x17,Barney told you.,Robin
03x17,"I don't know what you're talking about,madam.",Marshall
03x17,"Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking.",Robin
03x17,"Robin, come here!",Ted
03x17,"Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.",Robin
03x17,"Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",Barney
03x17,I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.,Marshall
03x17,"No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.",Barney
03x17,"I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87: A bro shall at all times say yes.",Marshall
03x17,So he saved you from an avalanche?,Woman
03x17,Yes.,Ted
03x17,And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?,Woman
03x17,Yes.,Ted
03x17,And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob?,Woman
03x17,Da.,Ted
03x17,Article 29 A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.,Marshall
03x17,"Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.",Ted
03x17,What?!,Barney
03x17,"Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.",Ted
03x17,Hey.,Barney
03x17,"Article 53: A bro will, whenever possible, provide his bro with protection.",Marshall
03x17,That feels nice.,Woman
03x17,Good.,Barney
03x17,I just wish we had some wine.,Woman
03x17,"Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.",Barney
03x17,"Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!",Barney
03x17,"Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.",Marshall
03x17,What if he never wants to talk to me again?,Barney
03x17,"Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.",Marshall
03x17,"Which brings us to April 25, 2008. My 30th birthday, or as it would come to be referred to in later years: The Day of the Goat.",Ted from 2030
03x17,"Hey, where are you?",Lily
03x17,"I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.",Barney
03x17,"Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...",Lily
03x17,Goat in a party hat?,Barney
03x17,"Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party!",Lily
03x17,"In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there.",Ted from 2030
03x17,"Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.",Barney
03x17,Okay. Bye.,Lily
03x17,"Whoa, you guys went all out.",Ted
03x17,"Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!",Lily
03x17,"Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?",Ted
03x17,Vegas.,Barney
03x17,Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.,Ted
03x17,"Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.",Barney
03x17,So there's no roof party?,Ted
03x17,"Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!",Barney
03x17,"Take me home, Barney.",Ted
03x17,"No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.",Barney
03x17,You slept with Robin.,Ted
03x17,You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!,Ranjit
03x17,When did you find out?,Barney
03x17,"Hey, Robin. Come here!",Ted
03x17,What's up?,Robin
03x17,"I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...",Ted
03x17,"Oh, crap!",Marshall
03x17,"Anyway, uh, I came across this.",Ted
03x17,From my vacacation in Vermont.,Robin
03x17,"Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.",Ted
03x17,I slept with Barney!,Robin
03x17,What?,Ted
03x17,"It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.",Robin
03x17,Of course we can still be friends.,Ted
03x17,So you're not mad?,Robin
03x17,"Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.",Ted
03x17,So you're not mad?,Barney
03x17,"No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.",Ted
03x17,I'm so relieved to hear you say that.,Barney
03x17,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!",Ted
03x17,Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.,Marshall
03x17,"Marshall, can we keep the goat?",Lily
03x17,No.,Marshall
03x17,But she's so cute and furry and soft.,Lily
03x17,"Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.",Marshall
03x17,Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?,Lily
03x17,"Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.",Robin
03x17,"Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.",Lily
03x17,Marshall!,Robin
03x17,I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.,Marshall
03x17,I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?,Lily
03x17,"What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.",Robin
03x17,I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?,Lily
03x17,"Lily,come on.",Robin
03x17,Hot wax?,Lily
03x17,Stop it.,Marshall
03x17,Did he tie you to anything?,Lily
03x17,That's enough. What's wrong with you?,Marshall
03x17,I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?,Lily
03x17,Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!,Ted
03x17,You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.,Barney
03x17,"How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.",Ted
03x17,You mean... what position?  Stop it! Stop it!,Barney
03x17,Hit him!,Ranjit
03x17,Ted! Stop!,Barney
03x17,Hit him!,Ranjit
03x17,Stop!,Barney
03x17,Hit him!,Ranjit
03x17,"Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face.  Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?",Barney
03x17,"You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, don't do this?",Ted
03x17,"Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...",Barney
03x17,"I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled stuff I have no use for anymore.",Ted
03x17,What does that mean?,Barney
03x17,It means... maybe you belong in that box.,Ted
03x17,Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?,Barney
03x17,I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.,Ted
03x17,"Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.",Barney
03x17,"Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.",Ted
03x17,Surprise!,Everyone
03x17,"Oh, right, the goat. So funny.You're going to love this. So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom and was eating one of Robin's washcloths and wait, hold on. Robin wasn't living here on my 30th birthday. When did this happen? Oh, wait, the goat was there on my 31st birthday. Sorry, I totally got that wrong.",Ted from 2030
03x18,"Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life.  The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.",Narrator
03x18,Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?,Barney
03x18,I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.,Ted
03x18,"It's Barney.  Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.",Ted
03x18,"Ted, I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls.",Barney
03x18,"Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.",Ted
03x18,"I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?",Barney
03x18,No I'm not.,Ted
03x18,"Sh! Let it out, let it out.",Barney
03x18,Goodbye Barney.,Ted
03x18,So are you two back together?,Lily
03x18,No.,Ted
03x18,I miss Barney. I haven't high five with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.,Marshall
03x18,Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?,Robin
03x18,Yeah! She had just as much sx with Barney as Barney had with her.,Lily
03x18,You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird.,Robin
03x18,I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple.,Ted
03x18,I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella.,Lily
03x18,She was right.  She had mat my friend in past for flying colors. There was just one little problem.,Narrator
03x18,"You guys haven't had sx yet!!?? When Marshall and I were two months, we were doing it 24 7.",Lily
03x18,"I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.",Ted
03x18,So what you guys waiting for?,Lily
03x18,"I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.",Ted
03x18,"Wait, so you haven't had sx since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.",Marshall
03x18,"Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day?",Lily
03x18,"Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.",Marshall
03x18,"Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?",Ted
03x18,"Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?",Randy
03x18,"No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.",Barney
03x18,"Assistant under secretary of only ok. Thank you, I will not let you down.",Randy
03x18,So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.,Narrator

03x18,"Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while.",Pitt
03x18,"Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight.",Barney
03x18,You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.,Pitt

03x18,"Starry Porten, Barney Stinson.",Barney

03x18,"Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan.",Starry

03x18,Yes finally!,Barney
03x18,"Here is what on the rocket tocket. My wife is gonna put the cheese out at seven, scrabble at 8:00 PM, 9 PM we watch 27 dresses, everybody's home by 11:00. Booya!",Willie
03x18,Hello?,Willie
03x18,Hanging up on you once wasn't enough.,Barney
03x18,"So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere.",Stella
03x18,"Let's have sx. Right now, I'll lock the door.",Ted
03x18,"Oh, there is no lock on that door.",Stella
03x18,"We can do it against the door. It'll be hot! It'll be like a three-way: you, me and the door.",Ted
03x18,"Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird between me and the door tomorrow.",Stella
03x18,I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.,Ted
03x18,You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make.,Stella
03x18,I was afraid of this. You're 14.,Ted
03x18,"No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone.",Stella
03x18,Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.,Ted
03x18,Really? How long it's been for you?,Stella
03x18,It's been a while.,Ted
03x18,Tell me.,Stella
03x18,Me too!,Stella
03x18,It's been five months for you too?,Ted
03x18,Five years!!??,All 
03x18,"Wow. Stella hasn't had sx since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had sx, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.",Marshall
03x18,"Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.",Lily
03x18,"The last time Stella had sx, the world was just learning about SARS.",Marshall
03x18,"Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?",Robin
03x18,"Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.",Stella
03x18,But nobody in five years?,Ted
03x18,"Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.",Stella
03x18,"In my defense, they were staring at me.",Ted
03x18,So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?,Lily
03x18,Actually...,Ted
03x18,"But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.",Stella
03x18,Your pillow talk's a little rusty.,Ted
03x18,"You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.",Stella
03x18,That's great. Like right now ready?,Ted
03x18,"So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.",Ted
03x18,"The last time Stella had sx, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.",Marshall
03x18,Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.,Robin
03x18,"Not the movie, the book.",Marshall
03x18,Wow.,Robin
03x18,"It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",Ted
03x18,You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...,Lily
03x18,"Oh, San Francisco!",Lily
03x18,"I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.",Ted
03x18,Notable deaths in 2003... Oh my God... Nell Carter. Did you guys know that Nell Carter had died?,Marshall 
03x18,I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.,Ted
03x18,"Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.",Robin
03x18,Not Nell Carter... Stella.,Ted
03x18,"Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",Marshall
03x18,Because you're dead inside?,Ted
03x18,"No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations.",Marshall
03x18,"Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",Ted
03x18,No.,Robin
03x18,"Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute?  Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?",Barney
03x18,Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.  Tomorrow works.,Randy
03x18,I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.,Ted
03x18,Fancy?,Stella
03x18,"Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever.  Huh. That's surprising.",Ted
03x18,What?,Stella
03x18,"This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",Ted
03x18,"Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?",Stella
03x18,No.,Ted
03x18,Quick on the draw?,Stella
03x18,No.,Ted
03x18,Unexpected number of testicules?,Stella
03x18,"No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel.",Ted
03x18,Virginity 2: Eletric Boogaloo?,Stella
03x18,"Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.",Ted
03x18,"Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs.",Stella
03x18,Unexpected number of testicules?,Ted
03x18,It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked.,Stella
03x18,Hey.,Barney
03x18,What up bro-seph Lieberman?,Randy
03x18,"No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word bro in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.",Barney
03x18,Goodbye Geraldine Ferrar-bro.,Randy
03x18,"You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.",Barney
03x18,What a loser.,Randy
03x18,"But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.",Barney
03x18,"Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.",Randy
03x18,"Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this.",Barney
03x18,Ok.,Randy
03x18,You ready?,Barney
03x18,"Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no!",Randy
03x18,What? What's the matter?,Barney
03x18,"Nothing, let's do this.  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!",Randy
03x18,Randy what are you doing?,Barney
03x18,"Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!",Randy
03x18,Hey.,Ted
03x18,Hey.,Stella
03x18,"So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...",Ted
03x18,Ted. Five years.,Stella
03x18,Straight to the hotel?,Ted
03x18,Straight to the hotel.,Stella
03x18,I'll get my bag.,Ted
03x18,"Hey, guys.",Stella
03x18,Hey.,Lily
03x18,"Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?",Marshall
03x18,Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.,Stella
03x18,Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a night out.,Lily
03x18,This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out.,Marshall
03x18,"Um, what are you guys talking about?",Stella
03x18,Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?,Lily
03x18,Hey guys.,Ted
03x18,"Ted, you told them, didn't you?",Stella
03x18,Told them what?,Ted
03x18,You told them that I haven't had sx in five years.,Stella
03x18,You haven't had sx in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!,Marshall
03x18,"Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.",Ted
03x18,"Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.",Stella
03x18,"No, they don't.",Ted
03x18,"Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having sx.",Stella
03x18,13 years??!!,Barney
03x18,I peaked really young.,Randy
03x18,That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.,Stella
03x18,You can trust me.,Ted
03x18,"Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours.",Stella
03x18,"Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?",Ted
03x18,Why would be looking for one?,Stella
03x19,"Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman.",Ted from 2030
03x19,"So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I sht the tnk, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.",Barney
03x19,He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...,Ted from 2030
03x19,So where were we?,Barney
03x19,...he gets slap! It kept happening...,Ted from 2030
03x19,Jerk!,Woman
03x19,Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...,Ted from 2030
03x19,Again? Really? Wait...,Barney
03x19,Barney knew who to look for...,Ted from 2030
03x19,"Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?",Barney
03x19,No.,Woman
03x19,What are you doing on Friday?,Barney
03x19,Stop! Amy?,Barney
03x19,Abby.,Abby
03x19,Riiiggghhhttt!!!,Barney
03x19,"Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...",Ted from 2030
03x19,A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!,Lily
03x19,"But then, that thousand-and-first time...",Ted from 2030
03x19,"You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?",Lily
03x19,"Hey, how was your day?",Ted
03x19,"Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.",Lily
03x19,A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.,Ted
03x19,"So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.",Marshall
03x19,But we can barely afford that to begin with.,Lily
03x19,"I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.",Marshall
03x19,"Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.",Lily
03x19,I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.,Marshall
03x19,What? Why just my clothes?,Lily
03x19,"We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my Split Happens bowling shirt.",Marshall
03x19,Dude.,Ted
03x19,I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.,Marshall
03x19,You made a Website?,Lily
03x19,"Yeah, it's called Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.",Marshall
03x19,"No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.",Lily
03x19,I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.,Marshall
03x19,"Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.",Lily
03x19,Why are you trying to ruin my life?,Barney
03x19,"Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.",Abby
03x19,And?,Barney
03x19,That's it.,Abby
03x19,"That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.",Barney
03x19,"Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?",Abby
03x19,"Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.",Barney
03x19,Abby!,Abby
03x19,"Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.",Barney
03x19,Ted said Marshall was his best friend.,Abby
03x19,Seven years!,Barney
03x19,Sorry.,Abby
03x19,Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid meaningful relationship with Stella.,Barney
03x19,I hate Ted.,Abby
03x19,I hate Ted more.,Barney
03x19,Are you as turned on as I am?,Abby
03x19,Probably not quite as much.,Barney
03x19,I'm sorry I yelled out Ted.,Abby
03x19,I'm sorry I yelled out Abby.,Barney
03x19,I am Abby.,Abby
03x19,"Oh, cool.",Barney
03x19,This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?,Ted
03x19,"Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?",Robin
03x19,"As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.",Ted
03x19,"Whatever, red cowboy boots.",Robin
03x19,Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.,Ted
03x19,"Hey, Lil, if I were to say Ted could never pull them off, What would I be talking about?",Marshall
03x19,His red cowboy boots.,Robin
03x19,I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.,Ted
03x19,"Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin.",Marshall
03x19,"The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous.",Robin
03x19,The Magnificent Kevin.,Lily
03x19,No Country for Straight Men.,Marshall
03x19,I don't want to sell my clothes!,Lily
03x19,"Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?",Robin
03x19,"Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do.",Marshall
03x19,I'll sell my paintings!,Lily
03x19,What?,Marshall
03x19,"Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, 500.",Lily
03x19,Yeah. Totally. But...,Marshall
03x19,"Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...",Ted from 2030
03x19,I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!,Marshall
03x19,"But then, that thousand-and-first time...",Ted from 2030
03x19,...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.,Marshall
03x19,What does that mean?,Lily
03x19,"Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it.",Marshall
03x19,You don't believe in me.,Lily
03x19,"No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!",Marshall
03x19,"Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?",Lily
03x19,"I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic.",Marshall
03x19,"Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?",Lily
03x19,"About 1,500 bucks.",Marshall
03x19,"Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes.",Lily
03x19,"Babe, we need money fast.",Marshall
03x19,"Well, give me a week.",Lily
03x19,"Okay, a-a week.",Marshall
03x19,Fine.,Lily
03x19,Fine.,Marshall
03x19,Pulling... Them... Off.,Ted
03x19,Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute...,Ted from 2030
03x19,I love it.,Woman
03x19,You do?,Lily
03x19,"Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100 silk?",Woman
03x19,It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!,Lily
03x19,"So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists.",Ted from 2030
03x19,We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.,Lily
03x19,Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?,Robin
03x19,"Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.",Ted
03x19,"Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.",Robin
03x19,Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors neat or are they more neato burrito?,Ted
03x19,"Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.",Robin
03x19,I pull these off!  I pull these off!,Ted
03x19,You know what I hate most about Ted?,Abby
03x19,What?,Barney
03x19,"His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.",Abby
03x19,You know what I hate most about Ted?,Barney
03x19,What?,Abby
03x19,"How he's always like, Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have sx with. He's so lame.",Barney
03x19,He's so lame and awesome.,Abby
03x19,You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.,Barney
03x19,"Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",Abby
03x19,I think so.,Barney
03x19,You're thinking of having sx with Ted?,Abby
03x19,"After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate.",Ted from 2030
03x19,Painting for sale! 500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.,Lily
03x19,"Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?",Man
03x19,"Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?",Lily
03x19,hero1n.,Man
03x19,Do you like hero1n?,Lily
03x19,"Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more hero1n.",Man
03x19,"Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...",Lily
03x19,It's not very good.,Man
03x19,"And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened.",Ted from 2030
03x19,"2 Oh, my God!",Man
03x19,"500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?",Lily
03x19,"Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.",Marshall
03x19,"Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... Suck It!",Lily
03x19,"Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?",Marshall
03x19,"Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!",Lily
03x19,You bagged a G-CWOK?!,Ted
03x19,"Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.",Lily
03x19,You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.,Ted
03x19,"That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.",Lily
03x19,"Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?",Barney
03x19,"Uh, yeah.",Ted
03x19,"Hi, Abby.",Barney
03x19,"Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?",Ted
03x19,"That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?",Barney
03x19,"That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.",Abby
03x19,"Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.",Barney
03x19,We're showing Ted how lame he is.,Abby
03x19,"You don't have to say it, though.",Barney
03x19,"Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.",Ted
03x19,"Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.",Barney
03x19,"We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.",Abby
03x19,"Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.",Ted
03x19,"Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?",Barney
03x19,"Wait, really?",Abby
03x19,I would never joke about true love.,Barney
03x19,"Yes, I'll marry you.",Abby
03x19,Okay.,Barney
03x19,"Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.",Abby
03x19,That's you.,Barney
03x19,"Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.",Ted
03x19,"Uh, yes, she does.",Barney
03x19,"It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.",Abby
03x19,Totally committed to the bit.,Barney
03x19,"Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.",Lily
03x19,"Oh, honey, hello.",Man 2
03x19,You sound happy.,Lily
03x19,Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.,Man 2
03x19,"Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.",Lily
03x19,"Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame.",Man 2
03x19,What?,Lily
03x19,"Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century.",Man 2
03x19,So... y-you didn't like my painting?,Lily
03x19,"Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you.",Man 2
03x19,"Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?",Lily
03x19,"Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.",Man 2
03x19,Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.,Lily
03x19,"Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world.",Man 2
03x19,"This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.",Lily
03x19,Really?,Robin
03x19,Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.,Lily
03x19,Da-amn.,Man
03x19,I got a two-syllable damn in this dress.,Lily
03x19,A two-syllable damn. That's the dream.,Robin
03x19,Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirlMetroNewsOne.com.,Lily
03x19,It's still in the family.,Robin
03x19,"Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.",Marshall
03x19,What?,Lily
03x19,I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.,Marshall
03x19,Really? Why?,Lily
03x19,Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.,Marshall
03x19,It's still in the family.,Robin
03x19,"And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.",Marshall
03x19,"Well, what happened?",Lily
03x19,"Well, hello.",Man 2
03x19,"Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.",Marshall
03x19,"Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out.",Lawrence
03x19,"Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.",Lily
03x19,"No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.",Marshall
03x19,Here's the important part.,Ted
03x19,"Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots?",Ted
03x19,Walter. Boots.,Lawrence
03x19,Pulling... Them.... Off.,Walter
03x19,I'll be in the cab.,Ted
03x19,G-CWOK-approved.,Ted
03x19,The painting!,Lily
03x19,"Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.",Marshall
03x19,"It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.",Marshall
03x19,Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?,Lily
03x19,You're about to find out.,Marshall
03x19,I had to make a trash run. Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.,Dr Greer
03x19,"Ooh, we don't need the details.",Lily
03x19,"Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think. Oh, thank God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles.",Dr Greer
03x19,"Anyway... I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, Hey,free painting, so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets.",Dr Greer
03x19,Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.,Dr Greer
03x19,Really? Dogs like my paintings?,Lily
03x19,"Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan.",Dr Greer
03x19,"Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.",Marshall
03x19,Really?,Lily
03x19,"Mm-hmm, at 500 a piece.",Marshall
03x19,That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.,Lily
03x19,"Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.",Marshall
03x19,In what?,Lily
03x19,In you.,Marshall
03x19,Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.,Ted from 2030
03x19,"Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.",Lily
03x19,"Man, birds do not get you.",Marshall
03x19,"Hi, sweetie.",Abby
03x19,"Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?",Barney
03x19,"No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?",Abby
03x19,"Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.",Barney
03x19,"So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.",Abby
03x19,"Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.",Barney
03x19,What?,Abby
03x19,Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.,Barney
03x19,Really?,Abby
03x19,"Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.",Barney
03x19,"Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.",Abby
03x19,"Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.",Barney
03x19,"Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.",Marshall
03x19,We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles,Lily
03x19,You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.,Marshall
03x19,Thanks.,Lily  Marshall
03x20,00 in the morning.,It's 10
03x20,boobs. Scotch.,I know what he saw
04x01,"Kids, there is something I wish my dad told me. The longest pause you will ever experience in your life is the one that follows asking the question...",Ted
04x01,Will you marry me?,Ted
04x01,"Your brain goes into overdrive, imaging every possible response.",Ted
04x01,No.,Stella
04x01,"Oh, God, no.",Stella
04x01,You want me to marry...No.,Stella
04x01,"Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't. Mark Johnson, the quarterback from your high school football team, already asked me.",Stella
04x01,"What's up, Turd?",Mark Johnson
04x01,It's Ted!,Ted
04x01,"But if you're lucky, she may answer with the single greatest word in the English language.",Ted 
04x01,Yes.,Stella
04x01,Stella and I spent that summer happily engaged. Marshall was still coping with unemployment.,Ted 
04x01,What are you doing?,Marshall to lily
04x01,Lily threw herself into her painting.,Ted
04x01,What are you doing?,Barney
04x01,Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident.,Ted
04x01,What are you doing?,Marshall to himself
04x01,"And well, Marshall just kept coping with unemployment.",Ted
04x01,What are you doing?,Marshall to Robin
04x01,And Robin continued to uphold the high journalistic standards of Metro News 1.,Ted
04x01,Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking... Tooth.,Robin
04x01,"Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter.",Robin
04x01,"Bogeyman with a teleprompter. That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke.",Barney
04x01,"Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny.",Lily
04x01,"Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. Bogeyman with a teleprompter. Classic.",Barney
04x01,"Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?",Lily
04x01,"I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?",Barney
04x01,"Barney, just say it.",Lily
04x01,I think I'm in love with Robin.,Barney
04x01,"Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella's wedding shower. Does she like to cook?",Marshall
04x01,"Actually, I don't know.",Ted
04x01,What's her favorite color?,Marshall
04x01,Don't know that either.,Ted
04x01,"Well, does she have any hobbies?",Marshall
04x01,"Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch.",Ted
04x01,"Dude, you don't know anything about the woman you're marrying.",Marshall
04x01,What? You're crazy! I know plenty.,Ted
04x01,What color are her eyes?,Marshall
04x01,The color of the ocean after a storm.,Ted
04x01,Which is?,Marshall
04x01,Beautiful.,Ted
04x01,"I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your sx swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!",Lily
04x01,It's not sweet. It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything.,Barney
04x01,"Barney, you don't catch feelings, you just have them. And they're good.",Lily
04x01,"They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin.",Barney
04x01,Morning.,Girl
04x01,"I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin.",Barney
04x01,"Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?",Ted
04x01,"No, Ted, I like Stella a lot. She's a Mets fan.",Marshall
04x01,Really?,Ted
04x01,It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?,Marshall
04x01,"I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to: that I love her.",Ted
04x01,"You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?",Lily
04x01,"I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, How can an ant carry 20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious? Are the two even related? Really?",Barney
04x01,"Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.",Lily
04x01,Boyfriend? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend.,Barney
04x01,"Well, what do you want, then?",Lily
04x01,I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.,Barney
04x01,"Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that.",Lily
04x01,"Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?",Barney
04x01,"I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little bstrd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?",Lily
04x01,Deal.,Barney
04x01,"Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?",Robin
04x01,"I know dudes think it's girlie for a guy to cook, but us ladies? We find it mighty sexy.",Stella
04x01,Really? You know... My grandma taught me how.,Ted
04x01,"Oh, yeah, she did.",Stella
04x01,Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports.,Ted
04x01,I'm on fire right now. Delicious. What's in this pesto?,Stella
04x01,"Oh, you know, the usual: basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient?",Ted
04x01,Peanuts.,Stella
04x01,Yes. How did you know that?,Ted
04x01,"OK, let me think, what else?",Ted
04x01,"You know what, sweetie? I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work. And there was that whole thing where you tried to kll me. Can we please just go to sleep?",Stella
04x01,"No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss?",Ted
04x01,"Dale Harris, second grade. You're talking like peck on the cheek or a full-on passionate making out?",Stella
04x01,"OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.",Stella
04x01,First time you had sx.,Ted
04x01,"Dale Harris, second...",Stella
04x01,Stop it.,Ted
04x01,"Billy Devito, sophomore year of college.",Stella
04x01,"Prude. Molly McKenzie, junior year of high school.",Ted
04x01,Slut.,Stella
04x01,Robin just needs to see this new see of you.,Lily
04x01,So just call her up?,Barney
04x01,Just call her up.,Lily
04x01,"You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times.",Lily
04x01,"Yeah, but those were just booty calls.",Barney
04x01,"On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say...",Barney
04x01,"Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait.",Barney
04x01,"But the later it gets, the fewer words you need.",Barney
04x01,And by 3:00 in the morning...,Barney
04x01,Sweet.,Barney
04x01,A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?,Lily
04x01,It's no worse than your super-obvious code words.,Barney
04x01,Rhinoceros.,Lily
04x01,We have to go.,Marshall
04x01,Great. Now we need a new code word.,Lily
04x01,"Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?",Barney
04x01,"You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?",Robin
04x01,Help me!,Barney
04x01,Just ask her something.,Lily
04x01,How are you feeling today?,Barney
04x01,Fine.,Robin
04x01,Something personal.,Lily
04x01,At what age did you first get your period?,Barney
04x01,Did you just ask me about about my period?,Robin
04x01,"No, I did not.",Barney
04x01,"Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.",Robin
04x01,Just ask her out.,Lily
04x01,"Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.",Barney
04x01,Gross.,Lily
04x01,First movie you ever saw.,Ted
04x01,"Benji,1981. I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought, Oh, that dog is so dead right now. What about you?",Stella
04x01,My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.,Ted
04x01,"You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars.",Stella
04x01,"She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.",Marshall
04x01,You've got to calm down.,Ted
04x01,"I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?",Marshall
04x01,"Dude, it's just a movie.",Ted
04x01,"Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.",Marshall
04x01,It's just a movie. It's just a movie!,Ted
04x01,"If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.",Ted
04x01,You can't.,Marshall
04x01,You want to watch it again?,Ted
04x01,I do.,Marshall
04x01,Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.,Barney
04x01,I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.,Lily
04x01,Why?,Barney
04x01,"Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.",Lily
04x01,"Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.",Barney
04x01,We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.,Lily
04x01,"You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?",Barney
04x01,Ted hit that for over a year.,Lily
04x01,Wish me luck.,Barney
04x01,"I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.",Ted
04x01,Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?,Stella
04x01,"The movie's already started, so...",Ted
04x01,It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.,Stella
04x01,"Oh, my God. Marshall appears behind the couch.",Ted
04x01,Off to a bad start.,Marshall
04x01,What are you doing down there?,Ted
04x01,I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.,Marshall
04x01,"What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.",Ted
04x01,"I really do, don't I?",Marshall
04x01,"So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened.",Barney
04x01,What?,Robin
04x01,"I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.",Barney
04x01,Why are you acting like this?,Robin
04x01,Like what?,Barney
04x01,"You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.",Robin
04x01,"I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.",Barney
04x01,Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.,Robin
04x01,Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.,Barney
04x01,"That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.",Robin
04x01,Your teeth look fantastic.,Barney
04x01,Who are you?,Robin
04x01,What?,Stella
04x01,Nothing.,Ted
04x01,You were staring at me.,Stella
04x01,You look really beautiful tonight.,Ted
04x01,"You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck",Stella
04x01,"Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.",Ted
04x01,"Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?",Stella
04x01,Nothing.,Ted
04x01,"Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.",Stella
04x01,"Should I leave, too?",Marshall
04x01,"What part, what part?",Ted
04x01,Thanks.,Barney
04x01,Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?,Robin
04x01,"I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.",Barney
04x01,"There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.",Robin
04x01,Why not?,Barney
04x01,Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.,Robin
04x01,We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.,Barney
04x01,It's not as easy...,Robin
04x01,Promise me you'll apply.,Barney
04x01,I promise.,Robin
04x01,"She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor.",Marshall
04x01,Great scene.,Ted
04x01,"Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.",Marshall
04x01,I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.,Ted
04x01,I'll tell her you still want to be friends.,Marshall
04x01,"I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly... Stop watching me, jackasses.",Ted
04x01,To taking chances.,Barney
04x01,To taking chances.,Robin
04x01,"You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.",Barney
04x01,Last call.,Barman
04x01,Of course it is. One more for the road?,Barney
04x01,"Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?",Robin
04x01,I loved it.,Stella
04x01,Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.,Ted
04x01,What was that?,Stella
04x01,"I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you mstrbtng little bstrd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.",Ted
04x01,It was so good.,Stella
04x01,"You hated it, didn't you?",Marshall
04x01,"It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?",Stella
04x01,Wookiee.,Marshall
04x01,"He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, That's a good point, Bear, let's try that.",Stella
04x01,"He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?",Marshall
04x01,I do.,Stella
04x01,"Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.",Marshall
04x01,"So, here's the deal.",Barney
04x01,"April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.",Robin
04x01,Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?,Barney
04x01,"You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.",Robin
04x01,So are you... nervous about the game?,April
04x01,"Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.",Barney
04x01,And that was it.,Barney
04x01,"I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...",Lily
04x01,"When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?",April
04x01,"My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true.",Barney
04x01,"Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.",Lily
04x01,I choose bimbos.,Barney
04x01,What?,Lily
04x01,"Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.",Barney
04x01,"This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.",Lily
04x01,"Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?",Barney
04x01,"See you, Barney.",Lily
04x02,"When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank.",Ted from 2030
04x02,"Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!",Barney
04x02,"Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?",Ted
04x02,"Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt?  Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.",Barney
04x02,"Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.",Lily
04x02,"That was the plan, anyway.  Over the next few weeks, Marshall went on a lot of interviews.",Ted from 2030
04x02,"You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused!",Marshall 
04x02,A lot of interviews.,Ted from 2030
04x02,"You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time.",Marshall
04x02,Too many interviews.,Ted from 2030
04x02,"You are sad, you are beaten down, you will get through this, come home, get in your big underpants and take a nap.",Marshall
04x02,"Which brings us to September 29, the night of the burger.",Ted from 2030
04x02,"So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?",Ted
04x02,"Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing.",Wendy
04x02,"Great, we'll take five of those.",Robin
04x02,Five burgers.,Wendy 
04x02,Really? You want to eat here?,Ted
04x02,"Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse.",Robin
04x02,I thought you started that yesterday.,Marshall
04x02,"I finished early, OK?  Five of those.",Robin
04x02,Five burgers.,Wendy
04x02,Wait. What about sushi?,Ted
04x02,We had sushi last night.,Lily
04x02,Italian.,Barney
04x02,I had Italian for lunch.,Ted
04x02,I can come back.,Wendy
04x02,"No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?",Robin
04x02,Chinese?,Ted
04x02,Oh.,Robin
04x02,I don't like Chinese.,Barney
04x02,Indian?,Ted
04x02,I just said I don't like Chinese.,Barney
04x02,Indian isn't Chinese.,Ted
04x02,"Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?",Barney
04x02,Mexican?,Ted
04x02,I just said I don't like Chinese.,Barney
04x02,God.,Robin
04x02,"Robin, yours will be right out.",Wendy
04x02,"Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me.",Robin
04x02,Sweet! You shouldn't have. That's so kind of you.,Everybody
04x02,"My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.",Lily
04x02,It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef klled it and ran it through the meat grinder.,Ted
04x02,"I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.",Barney
04x02,It's okay.,Marshall
04x02,Are you kidding me?,Everybody
04x02,"Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.",Marshall
04x02,And you've had the best burger in New York?,Robin
04x02,"It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place.",Marshall
04x02,"Oh, thank God it's just you.",Marshall
04x02,"You are being ridiculous.  Tell me, you left the apartment today?",Ted
04x02,"Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?  It's disgusting.",Marshall
04x02,"Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.",Ted
04x02,"What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.",Marshall
04x02,"That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.",Ted
04x02,"No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.",Marshall
04x02,"Go outside, go, go.",Ted
04x02,Okay.,Marshall
04x02,Leave the bat.,Ted
04x02,Fine.,Marshall
04x02,"So I went for a walk in the big, scary city. And I discovered something amazing: it wasn't scary at all. All right. What's the word?",Marshal
04x02,Your search is over!,Man in the street 
04x02,"And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...",Marshall
04x02,And there it was.,Marshall
04x02,Name two places where things get stuffed.,Barney
04x02,"So, I went inside.",Marshall
04x02,And I ordered the burger.,Marshall voiceover
04x02,Thank you.,Marshal
04x02,"Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...",Marshall
04x02,"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?",Ted
04x02,"I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.",Marshall
04x02,I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?,Ted
04x02,I don't know.  Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9:30?,Marshall
04x02,So we went out to get another burger. But after hours of searching...,Marshall voiceover
04x02,Damn it! Where is this place?,Marshall 
04x02,You couldn't find it?,Robin
04x02,We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.,Ted
04x02,"Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?",Marshall
04x02,Where do you think it was?,Robin
04x02,Probably tucked between her legs.,Lily
04x02,You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.,Barney
04x02,"Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.",Marshall
04x02,I couldn't help but overhear.,Man
04x02,"Okay, here we go.",Marshall
04x02,I know the place you're talking about.,Man
04x02,"No, you don't.",Marshall
04x02,It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger.,Man
04x02,"Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee: Starbucks.",Marshall
04x02,So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.,Robin
04x02,"Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.",Marshall
04x02,We're going.,Marshall 
04x02,But none of those places even came close.,Marshall
04x02,"There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?",Ted
04x02,Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.,Barney
04x02,The autographed picture.,Marshall 
04x02,"Of course I remember the place. It was the best burger I ever had. I still have dreams about this burger. Beautiful, haunting dreams! I wake up at night screaming, Get out of my head, burger! Get out!",Regis Philbin 
04x02,"That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?",Marshall
04x02,No.,Marshall
04x02,"And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face!",Regis Philbin 
04x02,"No. No, we don't know where it is.",Barney
04x02,"Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat.",Regis Philbin 
04x02,"I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!",Barney
04x02,"OK, Regis, we will, we will.",Barney
04x02,What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!,Regis Philbin
04x02,All right.,Barney
04x02,"Let's go, all of you!",Regis Philbin
04x02,That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says Burger.,Marshall
04x02,"Green door, red neon sign that says Burger?",Robin
04x02,Yeah.,Marshall
04x02,"I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.",Robin
04x02,I knew it was on a numbered street!,Marshall
04x02,Finally.,Robin
04x02,"No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! He throws away the burger.",Marshall 
04x02,No...,Robin
04x02,I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger,Marshall
04x02,"Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.",Lily
04x02,"You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.",Barney
04x02,"Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.",Lily
04x02,"How lame is free atmatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3 APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs.",Barney
04x02,We should probably call Regis.,Ted
04x02,Reg...  That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.,Barney
04x02,Heads or Tails - Studio set,Million Dollar
04x02,"Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads. The one before that was tails. You polled the audience; they came out split, 50 50. No help at all there. So, for 258,000... I have to ask you, Kathy, what's it gonna be: heads...or...  Excuse me. Oh, boy. I've got to go. I've got to go!",Regis Philbin
04x02,"Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.",Marshall
04x02,I will eat your hand.,Robin 
04x02,Let's just go inside then. Shall we?,Marshall
04x02,Thank you.,Marshall 
04x02,Yours will be right out.,Waitress
04x02,"Please, go ahead, start.",Robin
04x02,Just shut up and eat.,Robin
04x02,All right.,Barney
04x02,Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.,Ted
04x02,I think I just had my first burg-asm.,Lily
04x02,"I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?",Barney
04x02,This isn't it.,Marshall 
04x02,What?,Everybody
04x02,It's not it.,Marshall
04x02,"Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same",Ted
04x02,"I mean, it is just a burger.",Robin
04x02,"Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.",Marshall
04x02,And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.,Lily
04x02,"Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says Burger. I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.",Marshall
04x02,I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.,Robin
04x02,"Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.",Lily
04x02,Tell them about the underpants.,Ted
04x02,What about the underpants?,Robin
04x02,It started a couple of weeks ago.,Lily
04x02,Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.,Marshall
04x02,"Hey, baby.",Lily
04x02,Hey!,Marshall
04x02,Did you put on pants today?,Lily
04x02,Nope. They laugh.,Marshall
04x02,"It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that. Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.",Lily
04x02,"Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.",Ted
04x02,How big is Marshall's underpants radius?,Robin
04x02,We're going.,Marshall
04x02,"Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.",Ted
04x02,"You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank. Member FDIC.",Barney
04x02,We've got to find Marshall that burger.,Lily
04x02,"Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.",Ted
04x02,I'm not eating that burger.,Robin
04x02,"No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.",Lily
04x02,Finally.,Robin
04x02,"Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate.",Lily
04x02,"Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and Burger sign.",Waitress
04x02,What? Uptown? Where?,Ted
04x02,106th and Manhattan Avenue.,Waitress
04x02,Damn it.,Robin
04x02,106. A numbered street. Of course.,Marshall
04x02,Barney Stinson.,Barney
04x02,"Barney, where the hell are you?",Regis Philbin 
04x02,"I'm sorry, this is...?",Barney
04x02,Regis. I'm at the place.,Regis Philbin
04x02,"Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.",Barney
04x02,"What? Uptown? He breaks a mail box. Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare.",Regis Philbin
04x02,Onions?,Barney
04x02,Onions?,Regis Philbin 
04x02,"Okay, no onions.",Barney
04x02,Stop the cab!,Marshall
04x02,Wait. This is it.,Marshall
04x02,Your search is over. We got girls taking off their clothes.,Man in the streets
04x02,This is it.,Marshall
04x02,"One of 9,000 convenient locations.",Barney
04x02,It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.,Marshall
04x02,I don't understand. Where is the burger place?,Robin
04x02,It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.,Ted
04x02,That's fine. Let's just eat here.,Robin 
04x02,We can't eat here. It's an ATM.,Ted
04x02,But... food.,Robin
04x02,What the...,Barney
04x02,"This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.",Lily
04x02,"It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily.",Barney
04x02,"I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!",Lily
04x02,"Marshall, Geez.",Barney
04x02,"They suck, suck!",Lily
04x02,Will you just tell her already?,Barney
04x02,Tell me what? Tell me what?,Lily
04x02,I got a job.,Marshall
04x02,What? Where?,Lily
04x02,"Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.",Marshall
04x02,"Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.",Barney
04x02,But you want to be an environmental lawyer.,Lily
04x02,"Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.",Marshall
04x02,You've got great pants.,Lily
04x02,I love you.,Marshall
04x02,I love you.,Lily
04x02,"Robin, no!",Ted
04x02,They're unopened.,Robin
04x02,Give it.,Ted
04x02,They're barbecue.,Robin
04x02,Give it!,Ted
04x02,I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.,Lily
04x02,"It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.",Marshall
04x02,"You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks.",Man
04x02,A hundred bucks? That's crazy.,Robin 
04x02,Let's pay the man.,Marshall
04x02,I paid for the cab.,Lily
04x02,I have any cash.,Ted
04x02,I haven't worked since March.,Marshall
04x02,"If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.",Barney
04x02,Member FDIC.,Barney
04x02,"So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later...",Ted from 2030
04x02,Thank you.,Marshall
04x02,"All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?",Ted
04x02,This is it.,Marshall
04x02,Yes!,Everybody
04x02,"It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.",Marshall
04x02,"And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back.",Ted from 2030
04x02,"I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there.",Lily
04x02,"Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.",Robin
04x02,This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.,Barney
04x02,"If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.",Marshall
04x02,This isn't it.,Regis Philbin
04x02,What? Come on.,Everybody
04x02,That's outrageous.,Barney
04x02,That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it!,Regis
04x02,You were just freakin' teasing us.,Marshall
04x02,"No, really.",Regis
04x03,"During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem.",Ted 
04x03,"Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick.",Barney
04x03,"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?",Ted
04x03,"Hi, Ted.",Barney
04x03,"I lived in New York, but Stella was living across the river in New Jersey...",Ted 
04x03,"Oh, no!",Ted
04x03,... So I took the train all the time.,Ted 
04x03,"What's up, Ted?",Man
04x03,"Hi, Matisse.",Ted
04x03,Theodore!,Marshall
04x03,T-Diddy! You've missed that!,Barney
04x03,Robin has had the job of presenter.,Lily
04x03,And we have a free bottle of champagne.,Robin
04x03,But it's empty now.,Marshall
04x03,"Oh, no!",Ted
04x03,"So, it was always as if I missed any.",Ted 
04x03,"Sorry, we could not wait. It cooled.",Stella
04x03,"Oh, no!",Ted
04x03,"Hey, big.",Lucy
04x03,"What's up, G?",Ted
04x03,Are you okay?,Stella
04x03,"Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train.",Ted
04x03,"Exactly, why not you invited your friends to come here?",Stella
04x03,It's a great idea.,Ted
04x03,"You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great.",Marshall
04x03,Why?,Ted
04x03,"First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.",Barney
04x03,Lily?,Ted
04x03,"I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone.",Lily
04x03,What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?,Ted
04x03,"And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey.",Ted
04x03,"Great, huh?",Ted
04x03,It's waiting for you?,Marshall
04x03,"No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey.",Ted
04x03,"So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body.",Ted
04x03,"Ted, if you mrderd me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever.",Lily
04x03,And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?,Ted
04x03,I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons.,Lily
04x03,"Children, your Aunt Robin was tired of his job, tired of lousy production...",Ted 
04x03,"I am Robin Scherbatsky, and you look...  And again at 1am.",Robin
04x03,... tired of the stories she had to announce.,Ted 
04x03,So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York.,Robin
04x03,"... and most of all, fed up with stupid puns.",Ted 
04x03,"Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died.",Robin
04x03,"So, when she knew she was national presenter, she could finally say the words she longed to say for years.",Ted 
04x03,"Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious.",Robin
04x03,Why it looks silly? She had a stroke?,Marshall
04x03,"Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good.",Ted
04x03,"With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all.",Robin
04x03,"It's you who wrote, right?",Lily
04x03,This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.,Ted
04x03,You wore towels.,Marshall
04x03,It's part of the team.,Ted
04x03,"This Saturday, when Robin left for his first day, we crossed the river to experience the amazing nightlife of New Jersey.",Ted 
04x03,"Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome.",Ted
04x03,"Well, there are games, there are movies. And there shall be beer in the garage.",Stella
04x03,"It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.",Marshall
04x03,"Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian.",Barney
04x03,No snakes on that plane.,Marshall
04x03,"Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?",Ted
04x03,"With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.",Lily
04x03,You can be at 22h.,Barney
04x03,"No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey.",Lily
04x03,You really hate this part.,Stella
04x03,What? No!,Marshall
04x03,"No, I understand, you're New Yorkers, you need a bar.You could go to the coolest bar in the state, which is so close that you will not believe it.  and bang, here. The coolest bar in New Jersey.",Stella
04x03,"Yeah, probably.",Lily
04x03,That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.,Ted
04x03,No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!,Barney
04x03,For torturlute? You're right.,Ted
04x03,Marshall.,Barney
04x03,You deserve better than that.,Marshall
04x03,Lily.,Barney
04x03,Not good enough.,Lily
04x03,Stella.,Barney
04x03,Sorry.,Stella
04x03,"I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not.",Barney
04x03,Who wants to play Scrabble?,Stella
04x03,"Yes, why not.",Lily
04x03,"Look, the letter X is a bit difficult to read because a few years ago, she walked into my dog. You know, we should get a dog when you come to live here.",Stella
04x03,When I what?,Ted
04x03,Super. This is Robin.,Stella
04x03,I thought they came to live with you.,Lily
04x03,"Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?",Ted
04x03,"Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!",Barney
04x03,I can not live here.,Ted
04x03,"It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.",Marshall
04x03,Air Hockey. Well done my fat.,Barney
04x03,"I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months.",Ted
04x03,"I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here.",Ted
04x03,"Yeah, it could play in the fire escape, be friend with the guy who sleeps on a couch in the driveway, biking on Broadway. Great idea, Ted.",Stella
04x03,I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.,Ted
04x03,"Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much! You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.",Barney
04x03,Stella has already warned me.,Robin
04x03,"So, your first day?",Marshall
04x03,It was not.,Robin
04x03,What?,All
04x03,"It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.",Robin
04x03,How so?,Barney
04x03,I know. He told me that I had had it.,Robin
04x03,I got it? I got it!,Robin
04x03,"Let's be clear, when I say you, I mean the interview.You have the interview. I do not want there to be confusion.You only maintenance. Not the job.",Voice
04x03,Thank you! Thank you!,Robin
04x03,I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job.,Robin
04x03,No!,Marshall
04x03,You hate that job.,Lily
04x03,It was not so bad.,Robin
04x03,How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain?,Lily
04x03,A cycorde.,Robin
04x03,You're in the eye of cycorde.,Marshall
04x03,Thank you.,Ted
04x03,Naughty.,Barney
04x03,"That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ethnic. There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?",Robin
04x03,You can not.,Barney
04x03,"You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts.",Lily
04x03,I called Joel.,Robin
04x03,"If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http:  www...",Barney
04x03,Come on. I will not call.,Robin
04x03,"not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time.",Stella 
04x03,This is the look.,Barney
04x03,I can not live here. I hate being here. I would kll myself.,Ted
04x03,"New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup.",Marshall
04x03,"It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you.",Ted
04x03,I'll give you  100 for hitting my fist.  200.,Barney
04x03,"Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.",Lily
04x03,10 000.,Barney
04x03,You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time.,Marshall
04x03,I'm sorry. You are in New York?,Ted
04x03,We lived in Manhattan.,Woman
04x03,Are you in town?,Ted
04x03,All the time.,Woman
04x03,You see? All the time.,Marshall
04x03,When was the last time?,Ted
04x03,We dined with O'Rourke.,Man
04x03,It's been closed for six years.,Ted
04x03,"It's been a while. Funny, not that we lack.",Woman
04x03,"I guess is the New Jersey-vegans, now. Honey, look, T-shirt with dogs.",Man
04x03,I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.,Ted
04x03,"What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier?",Marshall
04x03,It's the tears?,Lily
04x03,They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional.,Barney
04x03,Where is Robin?,Lily
04x03,"Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.",Robin
04x03,"Robin, hangs up. Do not do that.",Barney
04x03,"Sorry, I know, OK?",Robin
04x03,If you hang up no...,Lily
04x03,"Stop! Joel, this is Robin.",Robin
04x03,"So, Ms. Papillon wants to return to his cocoon.",Joel
04x03,I'm sorry for saying all this stuff.,Robin
04x03,"You can put your socks with your apology, for you have already been replaced. Brian is the makeup and it could not be more excited.",Joel
04x03,I can not do that. I can not do that.,Biran
04x03,"Look, although I want to see what college is over for the camera, if you can be here for the 23h, you can get your job.",Joel
04x03,"Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio.",Robin
04x03,You can never be in town in 30 minutes.,Lily
04x03,"Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it.",Barney
04x03,I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h.,Robin
04x03,31 p.m.. Marshall and Ted back.,She leaves home and takes Stella the bike that is on the porch. It is 10

04x03,"Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk.",Ted
04x03,And you registered?,Stella
04x03,No.,Ted
04x03,Why?,Stella
04x03,"Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey.",Ted
04x03,What?,Stella
04x03,I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.,Ted
04x03,"My daughter goes to school here. All his friends are here. I have lived here all my life. My whole family is here. This is my house. I'm at the EPA. And since June 1, I am the deputy mayor.",Stella
04x03,"Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro.",Ted
04x03,"It moves not, end of discussion.",Stella
04x03,How does it end of discussion? It never was.,Ted
04x03,That's what being a parent. I want to uproot Lucy.,Stella
04x03,People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.,Ted
04x03,It is. New York is the largest city in the world. Where the dream come true and of pigeon shit tastes like tapioca. Want a little secret? New Jersey... is better than New York.,Stella
04x03,Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.,Ted
04x03,"New York is full of crazies, snobs and bad people. You know that once an old woman called me a slut and gave me a cat in his face? And you want to know if it's the same in New Jersey? 86th and Lex, right in front of your dear little Papaya King. The people of New Jersey are nice. This is the kind of place where you know your neighbors.",Stella
04x03,"Hey, I know my neighbors!",Ted
04x03,"Yes, that kind?",Stella
04x03,"At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I.",Ted
04x03,Claxpamon?,Stella
04x03,It is called Paxton.,Lily
04x03,I love this guy.,Ted
04x03,"47 p.m., Robin is the bike on the train.",10
04x03,"Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first.",Robin
04x03,Do not spill Matisse.,Matisse
04x03,"Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.",Lily
04x03,"Oh, yes. Tape for safety.",Barney
04x03,It was Atlantic City.,Stella
04x03,You can not beat A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know.,Barney

04x03,"56 p.m., Robin slalom between the cars.",10
04x03,"Children, believe it or not, but Aunt Robin swears it happened like this...",Ted 
04x03,"Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey, you think not to like New York, but believe me, Marshall did not believe it either, and now he would move for anything.",Lily
04x03,"I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas.",Marshall
04x03,"but, Marshall, you love New York.",Lily
04x03,"Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?",Marshall
04x03,"Small town, big men, then tope.",Barney
04x03,"It is too noisy, all the time. Yes, it is the city that never sleeps. Well, I would sleep well. I'm tired for 8 years. Tired and scared, with black and blue marks on my elbows to try to keep between the gateway for elves. New Jersey's great. There are department stores, and lawn and you do not have to wear a cup. For the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say so. I love New Jersey. Just kidding.",Marshall
04x03,"I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn.",Ted
04x03,"You know what, Ted... Live wherever you want. I do not care.",Stella
04x03,Silence embarrassed. Tope then.,Barney
04x03,"Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?",Ted
04x03,There was noise in the cellar.,Lucy

04x03,Why do you not read me one?,Lucy
04x03,Let's go.,Ted
04x03,I moved here.,Ted
04x03,Really?,Stella
04x03,Really. New Jersey wins.,Ted
04x03,"59 p.m., Robin arrives at the studio of Metro New One.",10
04x03,"Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York.",Robin
04x03,"Look, it did.",Barney
04x03,"Our story tonight, the baby panda at the zoo in Central Park made his first tooth today. I think that makes him a... Bear molar. Bear molar. Bear molar. You know what? It's really over for me. Good night, New York.",Robin
04x03,It really stops.,Lily
04x03,You think you're there for something?,Barney
04x03,"I think so. Good job, Barney.",Lily
04x03,"Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I klled my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!",Barney
04x03,What's the matter?,Lily
04x03,I have not officially got the job.,Robin
04x03,I'm sorry.,Lily
04x03,It's OK. They offer me another.,Robin
04x03,It's great. This is for what?,Ted
04x03,Foreign Correspondent. I... moved to Japan.,Robin
04x04,Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work.,Robin
04x04,I think it'll work.,Marshall
04x04,I hope not.,Lily
04x04,There he is.,Ted
04x04,"You there, what's your name?",Barney
04x04,Excuse me?,Woman
04x04,"Your name, woman, what's your name?",Barney
04x04,"I knew it. You are the Cindy, one that can change everything and bring us to our downfall. Listen to me, Cindy. I am Barney Stinson, and I have an urgent mission from the future.",Barney
04x04,From the future?,Cindy
04x04,"The future, and I can prove it to you. In exactly four seconds, the woman at this table will slap this man.",Barney
04x04,What are you doing?,Ted
04x04,"In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight.",Barney
04x04,What? I...,Cindy
04x04,You mean what?,Cindy
04x04,"I have not the time to explain. I must return to reality accelerator before the vortex closes. Only you can save us, Cindy. I must go!",Barney
04x04,"Well, the movers arrive in 14 hours. We have to go back to finish the boxes.",Lily
04x04,You have not finished? Why is it so long?,Robin
04x04,The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past.,Ted
04x04,Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour.,Robin
04x04,A half hour?,Lily
04x04,"I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears.",Robin
04x04,Moving is very moving.,Marshall
04x04,"But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual shit. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive.",Ted
04x04,"This is a Glen McKenna 50 years, and it is  2 500.",Wendy
04x04,"Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?",Ted
04x04,Vive la vodka.,Barney
04x04,It will not work.,Robin
04x04,"My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?",Cindy
04x04,"I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on.",Barney
04x04,Global warming?,Cindy
04x04,My God! How do you know that?,Barney
04x04,Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories.,Ted
04x04,"Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away.",Robin
04x04,So you keep a photograph?,Ted
04x04,"It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess.",Robin
04x04,Why not?,Ted
04x04,"Oh, dear. That's what the guys know that after moving in with a woman. All your stuff are idiots.",Lily
04x04,Like what?,Ted
04x04,Like everything else you bought the medieval festivals.,Lily
04x04,There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge.,Ted
04x04,"As you will not get bail, I thought you could pay me half.",Marshall
04x04,"Wait, why I pay more?",Ted
04x04,Because you've treated this apart as John Bonham treated his nervous system.,Marshall
04x04,That's not true.,Ted
04x04,Proof A.,Marshall
04x04,What is it?,Marshall
04x04,An Encyclopedia World Book of 1986. It is with these that I grew up.,Ted
04x04,Encyclopedia?,Marshall
04x04,"Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the e. The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change...",Ted
04x04,"You know, it'll have you dia-pays for it.",Marshall
04x04,"But you've ever done. Second, the evidence B.",Marshall
04x04,"Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival.",Ted
04x04,You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend.,Marshall
04x04,What damage did I do?,Robin
04x04,Do you remember the time you got drunk the pack of beer and you've become Super Canadian?,Marshall
04x04,Stanley Cup game six? The Rangers will regret having met with the Canucks.,Robin
04x04,20 if you manage to run it through the door.,Marshall
04x04,You're more amazing than a Tim Hortons donut. Timmy Ho!,Robin
04x04,"I'll give you the teeth of happiness. A little here, a little there.",Robin
04x04,Give me the stick.,Lily
04x04,"Get out, bouseuse.",Robin
04x04,Let's go!,Lily
04x04,"Catch it, guys!",Ted
04x04,I'll break!,Robin
04x04,"Girls, stop!",Ted
04x04,For America.,Marshall
04x04,It's good enough!,Ted
04x04,It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!,Barney
04x04,"Barney's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter.",Ted
04x04,"Children, to understand the history of the burn, I must tell you the story of the intervention for our friend, Stewart.",Ted 
04x04,What's going on?,Stewart
04x04,This is an intervention.,Man
04x04,"Alcohol has changed you, Stewart. We recognize you more. And I love the man I married.",Women
04x04,Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all.,Stewart
04x04,This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!,Barney
04x04,No.,Stewart
04x04,"Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?",Barney
04x04,"This evening, we celebrated our first successful intervention.",Ted 
04x04,I'm really proud that we have helped Stewart.,Robin
04x04,"Yes, what a moment of incredible human sincerity.",Lily
04x04,It's true. We live.,Marshall
04x04,You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?,Barney
04x04,"Yes, it's been two weeks.",Lily
04x04,"Two wonderful weeks... and oh yes, I will continue to wear it.",Marshall
04x04,This is an intervention.,Lily
04x04,About the hat.,Ted
04x04,I control. I can remove it whenever I want.,Marshall
04x04,"Dear Marshall, I do not like that stupid hat. I want to cut with a scythe. Or, cut the chisel, for you looks like a real jerk.",Robin
04x04,"After that, the interventions have become frequent in the apartment.",Ted 
04x04,Oh my God. This is one of p'tain of pleasant surprise. This is about what?,Lily
04x04,This is about the exaggerated English accent.,Ted
04x04,P'tain.,Lily
04x04,"Self Tanner? They entice you with a coupon, and after it becomes addictive.",Robin
04x04,"We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest.",Lily
04x04,What?,Barney
04x04,The magic tricks.,Robin
04x04,"Specifically, those with fire.",Lily
04x04,"The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage!  Thanks! Oh, shit.",Barney
04x04,It smells like hair!,Lily
04x04,And here the history of the burn.,Ted 
04x04,"It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner.",Ted
04x04,And?,Marshall
04x04,"And the flag was burned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with Ted written on it. You prepare a response for me?",Ted
04x04,"Well, that was stupid. Yes, forget it.",Lily
04x04,That was why? The sandals? Hair products?,Ted
04x04,No Stella.,Marshall
04x04,"My God, it was for Stella.",Ted
04x04,I just said No Stella. It was perhaps for your hearing problems.,Marshall
04x04,What?,Ted
04x04,It's getting serious. You see?,Marshall
04x04,You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry.,Ted
04x04,We want him. We are all really happy for you.,Marshall
04x04,"Like I said, it was stupid.",Lily
04x04,"Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions.",Ted
04x04,We made too many interventions.,Ted
04x04,What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?,Ted
04x04,"Yes! In the mouth! You said that the Barney the future work out. You told me I was crazy. My shrink told me I was crazy. Which is the narcissist with severe emotional disorders, Dr. Grossbard? A banner of intervention?That's what?",Barney
04x04,Stella.,Ted
04x04,I can not remain indifferent...,Barney
04x04,You kept it on you?,Ted
04x04,"Please. I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... Flames! Oh, shit! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, glass half full, but I think they become beasts.",Barney
04x04,"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.",Marshall
04x04,I meet this challenge.,Barney
04x04,What challenge?,Marshall
04x04,Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.,Barney
04x04,"I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged.",Marshall
04x04,I want to hear the other letters.,Ted
04x04,This is ridiculous. It changed his mind.,Lily
04x04,"And if you changed yet? Go Lily, listen to yours.",Ted
04x04,The capabilities of Gilbert reading have improved considerably... This is a letter I had to give one of my students.,Lily
04x04,Things go too fast between you and a girl named Stella?,Woman
04x04,I'd like.,Boy
04x04,I can hear yours?,Ted
04x04,"Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin.",Robin
04x04,You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?,Ted
04x04,"I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?",Robin
04x04,Water has flowed under the bridge...,Marshall
04x04,Come on.,Ted
04x04,"Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer.  It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement.",Marshall
04x04,Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.,Ted
04x04,And we're here.,Marshall
04x04,And we hope you're not sorry.,Robin
04x04,Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.,Ted
04x04,But concerns that a completely expelled.,Lily
04x04,But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.,Ted
04x04,"You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know.",Marshall
04x04,"I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?",Ted
04x04,Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low.,Marshall
04x04,"My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?",Ted
04x04,It was sophisticated.,Lily
04x04,My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!,Ted
04x04,What are you doing?,Robin
04x04,I unpack. I never leave this apartment.,Ted
04x04,"Ted, stop unpacking. You're in the process of pinball.",Lily
04x04,"I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!",Ted
04x04,"Good evening, young lady. You want a caramel?What do you mean, nothing in common? We're both older.",Barney
04x04,You're cute. How old are you?,Woman
04x04,83 years. How old are you?,Barney
04x04,31 years.,Female
04x04,Ted going bonkers. The movers arrive in 10 hours. His bride awaits in New Jersey. We must do something.,Lily
04x04,"I'm on it. Hey, man?",Marshall
04x04,Hey.,Ted
04x04,Come here a minute.,Marshall
04x04,What?,Ted
04x04,"Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the knife? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!",Marshall
04x04,"Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler.",Robin
04x04,I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.,Marshall
04x04,"You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily.",Robin
04x04,"This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either.",Lily
04x04,Come on.,Robin
04x04,"Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump.",Lily
04x04,"My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you.",Robin
04x04,"Oh, honey.",Lily
04x04,"Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good?",Marshall
04x04,"Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!",Ted
04x04,"Oh, my God!",Ted
04x04,I think someone owes me  200.,Barney
04x04,"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...",Marshall
04x04,This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis.,Barney
04x04,I am moving to New Jersey.,Ted
04x04,What?,Lily
04x04,"And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan.",Ted
04x04,Why?,Robin
04x04,"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?",Ted
04x04,"You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years.",Barney
04x04,"Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World wr II.",Woman
04x04,In an instant my child.,Barney
04x04,"Okay, it matters not.",Marshall
04x04,What? Why?,Barney
04x04,"It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net.",Robin
04x04,"You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one.",Ted
04x04,I had to leave my laptop...,Woman
04x04,Remove from here.,Ted
04x04,"And a year later, that's exactly what we did.",Ted 
04x04,"So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at  2 500 for a year of hell.",Ted
04x04,Amazing.,Robin
04x04,It's amazing.,Barney
04x04,"It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for  10?",Ted
04x04,Not at all.,Marshall
04x04,I would much Red Bull.,Barney
04x04,"Wendy, you can take a picture?",Robin
04x04,"Many things we changed this year, but some have remained the same.",Ted 
04x04,So if we continued the evening up there?,Lily
04x04,Yeah.,Marshall
04x04,Good idea. I have the tape.,Ted
04x04,What...?,Barney
04x04,Barney is an intervention.,Robin
04x04,"Sorry, I hear you.",Barney
04x04,"That's enough, the trick of old.",Marshall
04x04,The trick in the middle?,Barney
04x04,Forget it.,Lily
04x04,Leave baby? I love this old rhyme!,Barney
04x04,I will get my problem.,Ted
04x04,You're going to get my boat?,Barney
04x05,Hi.,Ted
04x05,Hi. How are you?,Lily
04x05,I'll just finish this.,Stella 
04x05,It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.,Ted
04x05,"You know, you dream of the perfect wedding since you been little girl.",Stella
04x05,Yeah.,Lily
04x05,Bluntly.,Marshall
04x05,"My sister steals my dream wedding. So every little detail on Shelter Island, the sun managed to sleep...",Stella
04x05,... near the beach in the old family home. This is my dream wedding.,Sister Stella
04x05,I'll finish it.,Stella 
04x05,It seems that the lamb is great here.,Ted
04x05,"I'm vegan. I wish I could silence that voice in me that says eating animals is mrder, but I guess I'm not as strong as you.",Nora
04x05,Did you need protein. I take the lamb.,Ted
04x05,"New objective: Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times.",Ted
04x05,"Ted, in high school, his marriage was you, right?",Lily
04x05,"You know, she always wants to overtake. I like it, but there is a part of me that would like it all falls apart.",Stella
04x05,"I hate it! I hate him. God, this steak is good. 4 days before and he fled with a consultant from Whole Foods? I do my make-up more for him. I do not shower more for him. I shave armpits more for him.",Nora
04x05,Hard to know where is the problem.,Ted
04x05,"Now, so close to the wedding... Got some bacon or something in the sauce. I love it. I would not be refunded. I will lose thousands of dollars.",Nora
04x05,"Children in a relationship, you develop as a telepathy with your partner.",Ted 
04x05,You think about what? It might help.,Stella
04x05,"No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge.",Ted
04x05,"It's true. Recovering your marriage, we reimburse you all that you paid for. Ted and I are getting married Sunday.",Stella
04x05,We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this?,Ted
04x05,"I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ready for it, but it has ever been. That's why we had never married. Come on, must be spontaneous, I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.",Stella
04x05,I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous.  I would not have done that.,Ted
04x05,"Children, morality often happens at the end of the story, but this one is too important, I will say now: Never, never, invite ex to your wedding. If I was given this advice, it would have changed everything.",Ted 
04x05,"We need you to come, this is my marriage.",Ted
04x05,"I can not. I am in Tokyo. This is my first week. I can not leave like this. In addition, I am finally serious information.",Robin
04x05,Robin was serious information.,Ted 
04x05,"It was the first English news channel in Japan. Of course, the info was a little different there.",Ted 
04x05,The board of the Fed voted not to change the... rates.,Robin
04x05,This is my marriage. You gotta be there.,Ted
04x05,"OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security.",Robin
04x05,It is.,Ted
04x05,"Okay, burial of bachelorhood. Tonight, I have three exotic dancers most flexible physically and mentally that you've ever seen...",Barney
04x05,No time.,Ted
04x05,I'll tell you.,Barney
04x05,Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.,Ted
04x05,What?,Barney
04x05,"No You not married, Ted? No You're making a big mistake, Ted? Have you stopped the fight against marriage?",Lily
04x05,"No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know...",Barney
04x05,"I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns. Then, finally, I dcryptais code. GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED.",Barney
04x05,So you come back to Robin.,Lily
04x05,Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it.,Barney
04x05,"You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear.",Lily
04x05,"Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw.",Barney
04x05,"And the day before the wedding, Stella and I made the trip to Shelter Island. With others not far away.",Ted 
04x05,It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted.,Lily
04x05,The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation.,Barney
04x05,"I know about you, but I will not namaster here too long.",Marshall
04x05,"Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink.",Lily
04x05,You have anything like Scotch?,Barney
04x05,"In the center, we have a strict anti-alcohol.",Bartender
04x05,"Super, meals included, right?",Marshall
04x05,"Yes, and they are all 100 vegan.",Woman
04x05,"I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?",Barney
04x05,There's no meat.,Marshall
04x05,There's no alcohol.,Lily
04x05,"Even worse, I'm 90 sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors.",Marshall
04x05,"Guys, Stella and I have a little problem.",Ted
04x05,"The programs are great. It is not our names on it, but otherwise it looks nice.",Stella
04x05,"Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time.",Ted
04x05,You're invited Robin?,Stella
04x05,"Yes, of course.",Ted
04x05,You gave me no warning. I'm not sure what to think.,Stella
04x05,Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.,Ted
04x05,"Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird.",Stella
04x05,But no.,Ted
04x05,It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage.,Stella
04x05,Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.,Robin
04x05,"When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back?",Stella
04x05,"Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.",Ted
04x05,Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?,Stella
04x05,She already has his ticket.,Ted
04x05,It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.,Stella
04x05,It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.,Ted
04x05,"No, Tony is the last person I want to see here, OK? And Robin is the penultimate.",Stella
04x05,"Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that.",Ted
04x05,"Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11 over last year.",Robin
04x05,What should I do?,Ted
04x05,I know. I understand something is no ex. Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone.,Marshall
04x05,What? No. Robin must come.,Barney
04x05,"That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl.",Ted
04x05,"I do not care, why do such.",Lily
04x05,"Dude, Robin has to be there.",Barney
04x05,It should not come.,Marshall
04x05,What are you parl...,Barney
04x05,"Aldrin Justice, the last word.",Ted
04x05,"OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride.",Lily
04x05,I will not tell him to come.,Ted
04x05,It's the right decision.,Marshall
04x05,It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.,Ted
04x05,"Co-witness, I'll handle this.",Barney
04x05,Hello?,Robin
04x05,"Robin, where are you?",Barney
04x05,I'm off to the airport.,Robin
04x05,"OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone.",Barney
04x05,"OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.",Ted
04x05,You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.,Lily
04x05,What do you mean by delicate?,Ted
04x05,"The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.",Lily
04x05,Do not you remember?,Marshall
04x05,The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?,Lily
04x05,"After a while, is that the waffle.",Marshall
04x05,Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.,Lily
04x05,What do I do?,Ted
04x05,"You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes.",Lily
04x05,And if there is no other crises?,Ted
04x05,This is a bride. There will be another crisis.,Lily
04x05,There is a new crisis.,Ted
04x05,Great! What is it?,Lily
04x05,"My daughter, my daughter does not come to our wedding.",Stella
04x05,What?,Ted
04x05,"Tony was the lead here tomorrow, but cash hurt my marriage, and he will not take him. It's been 5 years. Why not turn the page?",Stella
04x05,"So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage.",Ted
04x05,You are Barney?,Nora
04x05,Yes.,Barney
04x05,"I heard you were a real bstrd, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding.",Nora
04x05,I'm here with someone.,Barney
04x05,Bring her.,Nora
04x05,You'll never get there.,Lily
04x05,"So the morning of my wedding, I made the way home Tony, to take Lucy.",Ted 
04x05,We did a little karate?,Ted
04x05,"Sorry, sorry dude. You have my alarm activated defense. You must remember these things. Stay alert, rest life.",Tony
04x05,OK.,Ted
04x05,What brings you here? I thought you'd be in a bridal suite with my wife.,Tony
04x05,Not yet. Soon.,Ted
04x05,"That's right, tonight is the big night. Oh, man, you gonna make love to the mother of my daughter.",Tony
04x05,"Actually, I've already had sx many times. Why I always corrects people?",Ted
04x05,You and Stella. You're lucky. I could just... I am very happy for you.,Tony
04x05,"Look, here's the thing...",Ted
04x05,You can not take it.,Tony
04x05,"Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.",Ted
04x05,"You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had.",Tony
04x05,Let's cuddle.,Ted
04x05,"I'm sorry. Lucy is everything to me. I will lose it with this family, I am not one.",Tony
04x05,But you're part of.,Ted
04x05,I have not been invited to the wedding.,Tony
04x05,You are now.,Ted
04x05,"Road Trip OK?  Road Trip 2, back in the car.",Tony
04x05,This is the big day. You hydrate?,Nora
04x05,"Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson...",Barney
04x05,Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock.,Nora
04x05,I regret to inform you that at this time...,Barney
04x05,I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat.,Nora
04x05,There are currently no positions available.,Barney
04x05,I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.,Nora
04x05,"I will not do, huh?",Barney
04x05,No chance.,Lily
04x05,Let me talk to Stella first.,Ted
04x05,Mom! Ted invited Dad!,Lucy
04x05,"Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that?",Stella
04x05,What did Ted this time?,Robin
04x05,What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.,Stella
04x05,To be fair... your ex is here.,Ted
04x05,You've invited!,Stella
04x05,"Come on, it's not weird.",Ted
04x05,"It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.",Stella
04x05,"The children, if I had left Stella talking to Robin, this story would have ended differently.",Ted 
04x05,I understand.,Robin
04x05,I get it.,Tony
04x05,"For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby.",Man
04x05,"And now, how I met your mother.",Ted 
04x05,Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream?,Stella
04x05,But I have not done.,Ted 
04x05,You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.,Ted
04x05,Of course.,Stella
04x05,Sorry to have run away like that.,Ted
04x05,"It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...",Robin
04x05,You can not come to the wedding.,Ted
04x05,thank you God!,Robin
04x05,What?,Ted
04x05,It's weird.,Robin
04x05,It's not weird.,Ted
04x05,It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?,Robin
04x05,"Take that, bitch! I won!",Stella
04x05,"It was broken, there is more than a year.",Ted
04x05,"Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.",Robin
04x05,"So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.",Ted
04x05,That's not it. It's just...,Robin
04x05,Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.,Ted
04x05,"Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.",Robin
04x05,"It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...",Ted
04x05,I quit my job.,Robin
04x05,You what?,Ted
04x05,"I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.",Robin
04x05,What does that mean?,Ted
04x05,"You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.",Robin
04x05,I did the rain.,Ted
04x05,"It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.",Robin
04x05,I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.,Ted
04x05,Big fight?,Bartender
04x05,Yes.,Robin
04x05,There you go. It is for me.,Barman
04x05,"You stop it.  My God, so, stop.",Robin
04x05,I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?,Robin
04x05,Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.,Barney
04x05,"I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.",Robin
04x05,No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...,Barney
04x05,"And a girl naked, tied to your bed.",Robin
04x05,"The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...",Barney
04x05,"In addition, Barney.",Robin
04x05,"OK, let's go. Who's that?",Nora
04x05,The girl on reception.,Barney
04x05,Have his former close... it reveals unresolved problems.,Stella
04x05,"With your ex not far, which tells you that the flame will not turn back?",Stella
04x05,It's as if it was not over between you.,Stella
04x05,I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ready for it.,Stella
04x05,You see all... made me realize what I had.,Tony
04x05,I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.,Stella
04x05,"Seriously, kids, do not invite your ex to your wedding.",Ted 
04x06,"Children, on your wedding day should be the happiest of your life, the culmination of a perfect love story. My marriage, at least the first has not gone so well.",Ted 
04x06,"It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.",Ted
04x06,"Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours.",Lily
04x06,"I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!",Ted
04x06,"I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!",Barney
04x06,How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.,Marshall
04x06,"Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others.",Barney
04x06,"No, it is a mess.",Lily
04x06,It gauze?,Ted
04x06,A mess. And one must be there for him.,Lily
04x06,"But all my friends wanted to be there for me, I would, seemingly, well.",Ted 
04x06,"Hey, man.",Lily
04x06,You wanna hang out?,Robin
04x06,"Girls, I'm fine.",Ted
04x06,"Dude, you make some?",Marshall
04x06,I'm fine.,Ted
04x06,"Hey, kid.",Barney
04x06,"Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.",Ted
04x06,I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.,Barney
04x06,"Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow.",Ted 
04x06,What do you want for dinner?,Ted
04x06,"Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry.",Lily
04x06,We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions?,Marshall
04x06,It... I... miss him so much.,Marshall
04x06,"Yeah man, you've been a rock.",Robin
04x06,"I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily.",Marshall
04x06,"Super. Thank you, Ted.",Lily
04x06,"I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!",Marshall
04x06,It's OK.,Ted
04x06,"Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?",Barney
04x06,It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.,Ted
04x06,Why?,Robin
04x06,"It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.",Ted
04x06,"Ok, how about Hurley's?",Robin
04x06,Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.,Ted
04x06,"Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?",Lily
04x06,Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.,Ted
04x06,"Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?",Barney
04x06,Of course. Look at this.,Ted
04x06,It's that thing?,Robin
04x06,A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea,Ted
04x06,This is ridiculous.,Lily
04x06,The sea is blue.,Robin
04x06,You can not live like this.,Lily
04x06,"It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?",Marshall
04x06,"Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.",Ted
04x06,It's that one small dicks?,Marshall
04x06,"No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?",Ted
04x06,Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.,Lily
04x06,Super. Let's go.,Ted
04x06,Have you decided?,Waiter
04x06,Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?,Ted
04x06,Certainly.,Waiter
04x06,"Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?",Ted
04x06,I actually remember it. Oh Oh!,Lily
04x06,What?,Robin
04x06,I remember.,Lily
04x06,"Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.",Ted
04x06,"Oh, you laugh.",Marshall
04x06,He is serious?,Lily
04x06,"I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one.",Barney
04x06,She turns around.,Robin
04x06,"Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look.",Ted
04x06,Do you want covered?,Server
04x06,"No, I'm going home.",Stella
04x06,She took to win.,Marshall
04x06,She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?,Ted
04x06,Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella.,Barney
04x06,Will the yelling.,Marshall
04x06,"You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!",Lily
04x06,Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.,Ted
04x06,I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.,Lily
04x06,"Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?",Ted
04x06,How dare you pronounce this name to me?,Lily
04x06,Who is Gazeur?,Robin
04x06,This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school.,Lily
04x06,"Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day...",Lily
04x06,"Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty.",Barney
04x06,You did what?,Robin
04x06,Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice.,Lily
04x06,"Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze?",Lily
04x06,It was not me. That was it.,Purifier
04x06,Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur!,Lily
04x06,I'm in the team baseball. I'm cool.,Purifier

04x06,"I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of girls that I skipped... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time.",Barney
04x06,"Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?",Ted
04x06,Son of a bitch.,Barney
04x06,Who is Becca Delucci?,Host

04x06,"And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.",Barney
04x06,That's not true?,Lily
04x06,"Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.",Barney
04x06,"I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?",Barney
04x06,You're the only thing that kept me here.,Woman

04x06,"Hell, no!",Woman
04x06,"Now I have letters from Becca who say, I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. Women, eh?",Barney
04x06,You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur.  are still under the table.,Ted
04x06,We do not need. Stella is a party.,Marshall

04x06,It comes back.  We think you should talk to him.,Marshall
04x06,Not me.,Robin
04x06,What?,Marshall
04x06,"If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.",Robin

04x06,From Robin's father.,Lily
04x06,I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.,Robin
04x06,Why?,Lily
04x06,It goes back to my birth.,Robin
04x06,"Come on, give me my son. Grows.",Man

04x06,My body started to change...,Robin
04x06,"Wait a second. Sorry, continues.",Barney
04x06,It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.,Robin
04x06,The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the Squamish Invitational. And everybody came to my house to celebrate.,Robin
04x06,"Guys, you have behaved splendidly there on the ice.Splendidly. You go outside. I come back with soft drinks and pretzels.",Father
04x06,"I can not believe you hast missed the last shot, silly.",Boy

04x06,And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.,Robin
04x06,The blue line?,Barney
04x06,"You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that crease speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.",Robin
04x06,You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,Lily
04x06,"That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one.",Robin
04x06,"You kept it for quite some time, eh?",Ted
04x06,Yes.,Robin
04x06,It has returned to you.,Ted

04x06,I'll talk to him.  She's gone. I'll catch up.,Ted
04x06,"There, there.",Barney
04x06,There she is!,Ted
04x06,"I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?",Ted
04x06,"Well, well you do. You're going to confront it.",Marshall
04x06,I will face it.,Ted
04x06,This is so exciting.,Robin
04x06,Bluntly.,Ted
04x06,You're gonna say what?,Lily
04x06,"I will say, Sorry it did not work. We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.",Ted
04x06,"You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted.",Barney
04x06,You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.,Marshall
04x06,"Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...",Ted
04x06,Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.,Marshall
04x06,That's his problem.,Ted
04x06,"Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar.",Barney
04x06,I understand!,Robin
04x06,In the name of all that is sacred...,Ted
04x06,"Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel.",Lily
04x06,"Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?",Robin
04x06,Maybe she goes to his office.,Ted
04x06,No.,Marshall
04x06,The waiter asked him: Do you want covered? And she said: I'm going home.,Marshall
04x06,"If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. At home is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!",Ted
04x06,"Finally. Finally, my friend.",Marshall
04x06,I have the balls too!,Ted
04x06,"I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry!",Marshall
04x06,Me too!,Ted
04x06,"Lets get out, man, let out.",Marshall
04x06,She stops.,Lily

04x06,"Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy!",Marshall
04x06,Get rid of your demons!,Robin
04x06,I have ants in my leg!,Barney
04x06,"OK, wait. Wait...",Lily
04x06,What are you doing?,Marshall
04x06,"Wait. Listen, Ted, it's great that you're angry...",Lily
04x06,Sure.,Marshall
04x06,"... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say.",Lily
04x06,"I know exactly what I say.  You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.",Ted
04x06,"Ted, wait.",Stella
04x06,"Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.",Ted
04x06,I know.,Stella
04x06,Okay.  This is what I say.,Ted
04x06,It kills!,Marshall
04x06,From cold blood.,Barney
04x06,"Okay, tell him that.",Lily
04x06,"So I got out of the cab, ready to tell her everything, ready to explode but then...",Ted 
04x06,Mom!,Lucy
04x06,"Here we go at once. And it was over. At this point, I was not angry. I saw that she was made to be with him.Children, you might think that the only choices are to swallow his anger, or swing at someone. There is another option: you can let it flow, and when you do that, we can forget and move forward. And that was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.It was just not mine. Mine was always there, waiting for me.",Ted 
04x07,"I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.",Barney
04x07,And those girls over there? They are cannon.,Ted
04x07,Absolutely not.,Barney
04x07,"Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known.",Lily
04x07,You hate me?,Robin
04x07,A max.,Lily
04x07,"Barney, they are canon.",Marshall
04x07,"There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.",Barney
04x07,Anything.,Ted
04x07,Look at it carefully. Individually.,Barney
04x07,I know. The last one is kinda cute.,Marshall
04x07,"Yeah, really cute.",Lily
04x07,"And this, my friends, is the effect cheerleaders. Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed.  Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember.",Barney
04x07,What?,Ted
04x07,"Apparently, I'll be a father.",Barney
04x07,You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?,Ted
04x07,It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.,Barney
04x07,That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.,Lily
04x07,"No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?",Barney
04x07,"When you're 30 and you're a couple, something weird happens.",Ted 
04x07,You start to see babies everywhere.,Ted 
04x07,Go.,"Then a woman walks with a dog and a child on his stomach, followed by several puppies Marshall"

04x07,That's my little plug!,Woman
04x07,"That night, they had a serious discussion and hands-on children.",Ted 
04x07,"So if you have a baby, you think you can work less?",Lily
04x07,"No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day.",Marshall
04x07,And for the money? It has a ton of debt.,Lily
04x07,We count the unpaid bills on her pretty little fingers.Let's make a baby.,Marshall
04x07,Now?,Lily
04x07,There was just one problem.,Ted 
04x07,Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.,Robin
04x07,"So, Robin, when you're in for the job and apartment?",Marshall
04x07,"Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Marshall.",Robin
04x07,"They realized that if they wanted to start a family, they had the plan.",Ted 
04x07,"Robin, would you mind not sleeping with Ted tomorrow night? I... prepares a special dinner for Marshall.",Lily
04x07,Just a dinner. That's it. Nothing else.,Marshall
04x07,"Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me.",Robin
04x07,Enjoy it. It is a good time.,Marshall
04x07,"God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never...  Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?",Barney
04x07,Good news! I'm not a father!,Barney
04x07,"Congratulations, buddy.",Marshall
04x07,"This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is Day of Non-fathers.",Barney
04x07,You create a holiday?,Marshall
04x07,"Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?",Barney
04x07,It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.,Marshall
04x07,"Hello, Stinson.",Man

04x07,"Ready for tonight, Eriksen? Big merger.",Man
04x07,"That's between me and my wife, sir.",Marshall

04x07,Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone.,Robin
04x07,"Marshall and I, we took the decision to have a great...dinner. And I thought I was ready for a... dinner. But he called to cancel, and it got me thinking. Is it too early for us to make a... Dinner?",Lily

04x07,"Good night, Barney.",Ted
04x07,Good night.,Robin
04x07,Sock.,Barney

04x07,"No, you feel pancake, I'm sorry for being such a stupid drunk chocolate.",Lily
04x07,There's no I wish not to throw up on you bacon?,Marshall
04x07,Of course.,Lily
04x07,Baby...,Marshall
04x07,I blame myself for last night. I was really painful. I just panicked at the thought of whether we are ready to parent. But you are so well taken care of me. I know you're gonna be a good father.,Lily
04x07,I want to be a father now.,Marshall
04x07,What?,Lily
04x07,"Last night, it was just... I share between work and drunk baby Lily, it was too. I just begin with this job, I work long hours... I love you. And I really want to have children one day.I just want... I want to be ready for that.",Marshall
04x07,"Me too. When we're ready, I know you'll be fantastic.",Lily
04x07,You too.,Marshall
04x07,"You wanna make love, by protecting themselves now?",Lily
04x07,Yes.,Marshall
04x07,You want to finish your bacon first?,Lily
04x07,You're the perfect woman.,Marshall
04x07,"And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time.",Barney
04x08,"Children at the end of 2008, your Aunt Robin was unemployed and a little adrift, so his friendship with Lily was more important than ever.",Ted 
04x08,"So, it seems that Marshall has to work late on Friday.You know what that means, party girls.",Robin
04x08,"Well, a teacher at my school, Jillian, a birthday. What?",Lily
04x08,"It's just that... I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her.",Robin
04x08,Do not be jealous. We hang out together all the time.,Lily
04x08,"Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two.",Robin
04x08,This is false.,Lily
04x08,This is where the story gets really good. So it goes...,Robin
04x08,Hi.,Marshall
04x08,"... place. And then this... guy talking about this thing with the stuff of which I spoke the other day about this place.Well, anyway... it happened.",Robin
04x08,My God. You and the guy the mayor's office did it to the UN under the office of Ambassador of Zaire? Cool.,Marshall
04x08,"I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself.",Robin
04x08,"Come with me and Jillian, then.",Lily
04x08,"OK, but I want to stay too late because...  Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips.",Robin
04x08,You always mycoses?,Marshall
04x08,I want to take this moment.,Barney
04x08,Which one?,Marshall
04x08,The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted.,Barney
04x08,Marshall is my best friend.,Ted
04x08,Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?,Barney
04x08,"My best friend does not, but still.",Ted
04x08,You draw what now?,Barney
04x08,"Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc.",Ted
04x08,That's great!,Robin
04x08,"No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.",Ted
04x08,I think you'll love what's happened at work.,Barney
04x08,"While corruption has destabilized the regime and klled most of the royal family, it helped to relax banking regulation in Rangoon. Good for us. Last order of the meeting it was decided to continue on the project's new headquarters in the city of Goliath National Bank.",Bilson
04x08,Who's going to draw?,Ted
04x08,That was my first question.,Barney
04x08,Who's going to draw?,Barney
04x08,We approached a company. This Swedish architectural collective called Sven.,Bilson
04x08,Sven?,Ted
04x08,"Sven was this swedish architecture collective revered for their bold, innovative designs. I hated them.",Ted 
04x08,I hate them. Swedish architecture collective.,Ted
04x08,No one.,Robin
04x08,Pretentious.,Lily
04x08,It is not a company. It is a collective.,Ted
04x08,I know. We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower.,Barney
04x08,"Sweden, this is not France. You know that?",Marshall
04x08,"It's France. No matter, I told Bilson...",Barney
04x08,"Bislon, saving your...",Barney
04x08,"No, I get up, and I told Bilson...",Barney
04x08,"Bislon, saving your...",Barney
04x08,Music. Imagine a patriotic music.,Barney
04x08,"Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that...",Barney
04x08,"Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?",Bilson
04x08,Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.,Barney
04x08,"All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours.",Barney
04x08,You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?,Ted
04x08,"It's not the best. We three, we'll work together.",Barney
04x08,Ted will come to call.,Marshall
04x08,"Yes, totally.",Barney
04x08,What is it?,Ted
04x08,It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...,Barney
04x08,"Marshall, the teleconference begins soon.",Barney
04x08,"Sorry, I gotta go.",Marshall
04x08,And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.,Barney
04x08,It's great. Drinking at work.,Marshall
04x08,"Basically, it is of Mad Men.",Barney
04x08,Yes! There is too much Mad Men!,Marshall
04x08,I'll spank a secretary.,Barney
04x08,That's exactly what they would do in this series.,Marshall
04x08,What series?,Barney
04x08,And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.,Barney
04x08,I do not do that.,Marshall
04x08,I love to do that.,Ted
04x08,I will realize your dream.,Barney
04x08,"Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me.",Ted
04x08,"It was true. You see, children, when I became an architect, I had a dream... contribute to building a panorama of New York. I wanted to point one of these buildings and say, See that? That right there? This is mine. This job was the opportunity to realize that.",Ted 
04x08,"Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?",Robin
04x08,"No. Believe me, it's not his style. She must not know what kind of place this is.",Lily
04x08,"We're here, my little p  sexy! We just get served!",Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo.",Lily
04x08,"What is Woo? Let me explain. Woo is a kind of a young woman, who, like the cuckoo and the nightingale, takes its name from its singular it produces. Also, a Woo can be triggered in different ways. On one particular song on the jukebox...",Ted 
04x08,"My God, this song is my story too.",Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"... to a cheap shooter. On a ride on a mechanical bull... up, everything and anything.",Ted 
04x08,"Oh my God, I was afraid of not having fed the cat, then I remembered that I had done.",Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo.",Lily
04x08,It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo.,Robin
04x08,"Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.",Ted
04x08,"Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless.",Barney
04x08,"My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?",Ted
04x08,"No, that's fine.",Barney
04x08,"Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos.",Marshall
04x08,"My God, girls, my breast just out of my top bar. And no! I took it out for a drink blackjack!",Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?",Robin
04x08,"If rewarding. I dunno if you know the RIE method, but it derives from the philosophy of progressive education Steiner founded the Waldorf school, which is... Oh my God, I love this song! Come on bitches, let's dance!",Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"You too, my  s.",Jillian
04x08,No thank you... drag ignorant.,Lily
04x08,"Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd.",Barney
04x08,You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.,Lily
04x08,"Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist.",Barney
04x08,None of this stuff...,Lily
04x08,"Industry shooters memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when Brown Eyed Girl happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And Brown Eyed Girl. But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?",Barney
04x08,Who wants to name my tits?,Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine.",Barney
04x08,"The weeks that followed, I immersed myself in work. It was great to be on a project I really wanted to heart.Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived.",Ted 
04x08,"And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.",Ted
04x08,I came out pretty confident about my chances.That evening I met Barney.,Ted 
04x08,"Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.",Ted
04x08,You did not have.,Barney
04x08,What?,Ted
04x08,The Board... Sven decided to choose.,Barney
04x08,Wooo!,Woman 
04x08,I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?,Ted
04x08,I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.,Barney
04x08,It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.,Ted
04x08,"You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?",Marshall
04x08,I think I need it.,Ted
04x08,Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.,Barney
04x08,It's been what?,Robin
04x08,Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.,Lily
04x08,What?,Robin
04x08,You were seen to Woo.,Lily
04x08,"Given that, do Woo?",Robin
04x08,You who did Woo?,Lily
04x08,I have not done Woo.,Robin
04x08,"Oh, yes.",Lily
04x08,That's not true.,Robin
04x08,Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now?,Lily
04x08,"It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not.",Robin
04x08,Like what?,Lily
04x08,"As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo.",Robin
04x08,I can Woo.,Lily
04x08,That's not true.,Robin
04x08,But if.,Lily
04x08,"It's not you, that.",Robin
04x08,"Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job.",Marshall
04x08,Yes. I voted for him.,Bilson
04x08,It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.,Barney
04x08,Teleconference. Now.,Marshall
04x08,You wanna tell me something?,Marshall
04x08,Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.,Barney
04x08,Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?,Marshall
04x08,Okay.,Barney
04x08,"... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.",Ted
04x08,So?,Barney
04x08,It was great. I like it.,Bilson
04x08,It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...,Barney
04x08,"I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront. You are new and fresh.Women want to be with you, men want to hurt you, but the fool who dares challenge you will be crushed! Your home office will show the world these facts. And one more thing... Do not look now!  Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?",Man
04x08,"Oh, my God. It's me!",Barney
04x08,"You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus.",Sven
04x08,"I've never known so far, but I've always wanted.",Barney
04x08,"On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button.",Sven
04x08,What does this button?,Barney
04x08,Press! Press for the glory!,Sven
04x08,It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome.,Barney
04x08,There is a striptease club in the letter N.,Sven
04x08,"What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.",Marshall
04x08,It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.,Barney
04x08,You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.,Marshall
04x08,"It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall.",Barney
04x08,Fire Marshall.,Marshall
04x08,I have not even paid attention.,Barney
04x08,How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.,Marshall
04x08,"I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons.",Barney
04x08,"No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.",Marshall
04x08,Like what?,Barney
04x08,"Because, that.",Marshall
04x08,"My God, girls. Yesterday, we collected  10 000 for my charity that fights illiteracy children. It's a real problem.",Jillian
04x08,Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!,Robin
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,Wooo!,Lily
04x08,What are you doing here?,Robin
04x08,The same things are funny as singles.,Lily
04x08,That's what the fireman's helmet?,Robin
04x08,"I had no cowboy hat, and it was the day of fire safety at school... My God,  s. This is our theme.",Lily
04x08,Really? Who sings that?,Robin
04x08,LL Cool J stuff always comes out?,Lily
04x08,"That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?",Barney
04x08,I do not understand. Where is the call?,Sven
04x08,"It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great.",Barney
04x08,It's a waste of time. Pumps!,Sven
04x08,"Misty, you're a real slut. We get another shot.",Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"It's you, the slut, drag. It is you who pays.",Misty
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,"No,  s, it is you who pays. You're too p  a.",Woman
04x08,Wooo!,All
04x08,You are a bunch of prostitutes. You must have STDs.,Lily
04x08,Come and dance.,Jillian
04x08,"Lily, it does not work. You should not be there.",Robin
04x08,"I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck?",Lily
04x08,"On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his gn t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo.",Robin
04x08,You say that to make me feel not like an old married.,Lily
04x08,Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo.,Robin
04x08,Wooo!,Woman
04x08,Wooo!,Misty
04x08,Wooo!,Jillian
04x08,Wooo!,Woman 2
04x08,Wooo!,Ted
04x08,The poor girls... and Ted. I want to give them a hug.,Lily
04x08,"Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend.",Robin
04x08,"And you, mine. And I promise to dedicate ourselves more time. Marshall did not need to paste something from being done.",Lily
04x08,You have tested those purple shots in test tubes? I took five. I believe that there is no alcohol in it.,Marshall
04x08,Where did you get that hat?,Lily
04x08,What hat?,Marshall
04x08,It turned Sven.,Barney
04x08,What?,Ted
04x08,"Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is: you have the job.",Barney
04x08,Really?,Ted
04x08,"The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy.",Barney
04x08,It's weird.,Ted
04x08,"Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted...",Barney
04x08,"It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.",Marshall
04x08,You know...,Barney
04x08,"Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo!  The next is for me.",Ted
04x08,Why you helped me?,Barney
04x08,"You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.",Marshall
04x08,"You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall.",Barney
04x08,"Marshall eventually cracked and confessed the truth about Barney, like, ten minutes later, so much so that Uncle Barney attached to a mechanical bull, set to position Mixed Paint and it returned.",Ted 
04x08,"I love you, man.",Ted
04x08,"Me too, buddy.",Barney
04x08,You mount the bull?,Ted
04x08,"No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem.",Barney
04x08,It was a rather brilliant night.,Ted 
04x08,three hours. This is the record of the bar.,Man
04x08,"That's right, girls.",Barney
04x08,"You know what would be really crazy, funny and stupid to do tonight? If you and I, we found a guy to do it for three.",Woman
04x08,Maybe... If we find the right guy.,Jillian
04x08,"Yes, and... if there is not the right guy, both could just...",Woman
04x08,"You know who is more cute? This guy, Ted. Come and get it.",Jillian
04x09,"Children, it is believed all know how long it takes to recover from a breakup.",Ted 
04x09,Half the time the relationship.,Lily
04x09,One week per month spent together.,Marshall
04x09,"Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes.",Robin
04x09,You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!,Barney
04x09,Hi.,Ted
04x09,Hi.,Woman
04x09,"You take the temperature, to get an impression.",Ted 
04x09,For me it's Ted.,Ted
04x09,And you come back gently into the water.,Ted 
04x09,"I was left on the altar, there is one month.",Ted
04x09,"Or, you know, the bmb.",Ted 
04x09,"It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?",Ted
04x09,Yes.,Vicky
04x09,"Children, I saw a bunch of crazy stuff on entering the apartment all these years.",Ted 
04x09,Sorry guys. I'll just make a fruit cup.,Lily
04x09,It's been 12 minutes!,Marshall
04x09,Put it!,Robin
04x09,You first!,Man 1
04x09,"Why you referred me, Ike?",Man 2
04x09,Do not say my name!,Ike
04x09,Ask your wapons!,Robin
04x09,But one of the craziest things I saw happened when I was a roommate with your Aunt Robin.,Ted 
04x09,You're who?,Ted
04x09,"What are you doing, Mitch?",Ted
04x09,You must be the roommate. I'm with Robin. She came out to take a call. I think its handheld gaming here.,Mitch
04x09,"Robin did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now.",Ted
04x09,"I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?",Robin
04x09,"Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Robin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch.",Ted
04x09,His thing arranged? A real disaster. She sent me text messages all night. She just let go to use the bathroom.,Lily
04x09,Excuse me one minute.,Ted
04x09,"Man, you annoy me. I am in action here.",Mitch
04x09,What action?,Ted
04x09,"This is my technique. It's called, The guy with hair.",Mitch
04x09,The guy naked?,Ted
04x09,"That's the trick. You're the first date, you've had a few drinks, you go out an excuse to go to the girl.",Mitch
04x09,"The bathroom is.  You know what, I will respond.",Robin
04x09,"Then when she leaves, you undress and wait for you.When she returns, she laughs. She is so fascinated by your insurance, and your bravado she sleep with you.",Mitch
04x09,No chance it works!,Ted
04x09,Two out of three.,Mitch
04x09,Two out of three?,Ted
04x09,"Two out of three. You just choose your moment. The guy naked mostly run as a last resort, the last resort to first appointment when you know that there will be no second.",Mitch
04x09,How do you know?,Ted
04x09,Look at me.,Mitch
04x09,I'd rather not.,Ted
04x09,"Robin is not in my division. I'm not smart, funny and handsome. As you can see, there is nothing impressive nowhere there. My only chance with a girl like Robin, is the surprise. And let's be honest, a little pity. This is shock and Ohhh.",Mitch
04x09,It does not work really.,Ted
04x09,Two out of three. Guaranteed.,Mitch
04x09,No December '.,Marshall
04x09,Two out of three. He assured me.,Ted
04x09,"Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers.",Barney
04x09,"She'll beat him up, yes.",Lily
04x09,It's going to take his gn and sht him.,Marshall
04x09,My God!,Marshall
04x09,It worked.,Ted
04x09,The business returns for Mr. Popol.,Marshall
04x09,The naked guy works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!,Barney
04x09,"Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?",Lily
04x09,"The naked guy is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go.",Barney
04x09,What kind of gadgets you talking about?,Lily
04x09,"So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked.",Ted
04x09,I can not tell you.,Robin
04x09,I can not believe that The guy with hair 'market has on you.,Ted
04x09,"How do you say? I entered and he was naked. It was funny. I laughed, he laughed. And then it happened. I know not.",Robin
04x09,I say  s!,Marshall
04x09,Sorry?,Robin
04x09,"Sorry Robin, but cate with this type suggests that all that separates you from sx, it's the clothes.",Marshall
04x09,I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked.,Robin

04x11,Really? You're like Weird Al Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.,Ted

04x11,So... I found an apartment today.,Heather

04x11,I'll take my hat fisherman. Thank you for bringing me here. This is mine.,Robin

04x11,"It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago.",Ted
04x11,"Ted, many women have a period kleptomaniac. And yes, maybe sometimes they happen to mow a small object because it excites them in a strange way they are not explained. But... If it reassures you, I will accompany them to GNB, tomorrow. I will say that I'm going to lunch with Marshall, but in fact I espionnerai.",Lily
04x11,It suits me. Good luck tomorrow at the GNB. I'm sure you will impress them.,Ted

04x11,Why?,Ted
04x11,I have a secret. No! It has not happened. It happened something.,Lily

04x11,"Before you say or do something, give me a favor.",Barney
04x11,What?,Lily
04x11,Move away. It's a Prada.,Barney
04x11,I'm really sorry.,Lily
04x11,I knew it. I've always known. It remained the same trail irresponsible. And when I see Barney...,Ted

04x11,"I love this kit, but I can not afford. You were right, Ted.",Heather

04x11,I know! They all bought into.,Robin
04x11,I see what you do.,Marshall
04x11,What?,Robin
04x11,"I've brought here because... I was sorry for you. And there, it looks like you're trying to steal my bar.",Marshall
04x11,You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host.,Robin
04x11,Host? Are you Canadian?,Man
04x11,"No, I...",Robin
04x11,"If you want to imitate a Canadian, just turn off the light and act as if you were afraid!",Man
04x11,What was that?,Robin
04x11,"With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme.",Marshall
04x11,As fear of the dark?,Robin
04x11,"Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid!",Marshall
04x11,This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?,Robin
04x11,"Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back.",Marshall
04x11,"No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians.",Robin
04x11,"Please, no scene.",Marshall
04x11,"Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!",Robin
04x11,I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position.,Barney

04x11,"I swear, these coasters are thicker.",Lily
04x11,I'm ready to bend over backwards.,Heather
04x11,"OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!",Ted
04x11,You've sneaked?,Barney
04x11,You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender.,Lily
04x11,"And you, you're mature and responsible?It's responsible adult to go to your first interview in New York and banging a stranger? You've always been immature and irresponsible. You'll always be immature and irresponsible.And I cosignerai not a subscription with you, let alone a lease.",Ted 
04x11,"Barney and I, we did nothing.",Heather
04x11,Come on. Lily saw you.,Ted
04x11,Oh yeah?,Barney
04x11,"You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather...",Barney
04x11,... That we decided to show you what you expect from us.,Heather
04x11,And as we can count on Lily to sneak.,Barney
04x11,My God!,Lily
04x11,What? Why do this?,Ted
04x11,Because you deserve it.,Heather
04x11,"Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe.",Barney
04x11,"You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas.",Heather
04x11,"Your mother and I, we kissed.",Barney

04x11,High Scores! You got beat Marshall!,Man 1

04x11,You're angry because she beat you.,Man 1
04x11,"During the 1999 NFC Championship, when the Vikings lost...",Marshall
04x11,Holy shit!,All
04x11,... who was the scorer who missed the penalty?,Marshall
04x11,Rashad Tarkenton.,Robin
04x11,Gary Anderson. He is retired. It was a case of fly fishing... in Canada.,Marshall
04x11,Goodbye.,Man 1
04x11,"You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the Great White North... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else.",Robin
04x11,Merry Christmas. Look into it. If you push around the...Not down the middle.,Ted

04x11,"By the way, in your new neighborhood, you should put a good lock on your door. If you want... live.",Ted
04x11,Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything.,Marshall
04x11,"I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing.",Robin
04x11,But if.,Marshall
04x11,What?,Robin
04x11,"We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky.",Marshall
04x11,Thank you.,Robin
04x11,Yeah.,Marshall
04x11,I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada.,Robin
04x11,I was hoping that you say that.,Marshall
04x11,How did you find this place?,Robin
04x11,"Just like home, eh?",Marshall
04x11,There's only one way to know.,Robin
04x11,Sorry. I had not seen. Are you okay?,Man

04x11,Everyone comes to play. Take all your worries.  Let's go to the mall. Today!,All
04x12,"Children in the winter of 2009, Robin and I became roommates. And to be honest it was not really the top.",Ted 
04x12,It looks good. I'll do.,Ted
04x12,There's no more milk.,Robin
04x12,I saw in the fridge.,Ted
04x12,empty.,Robin
04x12,"So, throw it.",Ted

04x12,"You know what? Instead of coming with references typical last minute like that, you should spend some time, I dunno... washing a dish.",Robin

04x12,"I always changing. You, never!",Robin

04x12,I know. It's been what?,Ted
04x12,You know what this is? We made love. Men and women need sx to live together. It resolves all disputes.,Robin

04x12,"Well, I think we should love again.",Ted
04x12,"Yes, of course.",Robin

04x12,"Biking upside down. Well, listen. If it should happen on occasion, they say nothing to anyone. Sold.",Ted
04x12,Sold.,Robin
04x12,Sold.,Marshall
04x12,"You do not care what, guys? You are back together?",Marshall
04x12,No. It was just love to do more fighting.,Ted

04x12,Why are you here anyway?,Robin
04x12,I was working and I had to take a leap here...reading this magazine. In... the room there.,Marshall
04x12,I understand. No problem.,Ted
04x12,"If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door?",Robin
04x12,"Well, Robin. Nobody likes reading a magazine at work. You leave your office holding a magazine...",Marshall
04x12,... and the magazine says one thing and no one.,Marshall
04x12,"Hey everybody, look at what Marshall will do!Marshall will read an old magazine in the bathroom that you all share with him.",Magazine
04x12,Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine?,Robin
04x12,You have to read a magazine. That's why there has magazines.,Marshall
04x12,"So, this is wasted time.",Ted
04x12,"Exactly. And the worst part is, this piece of my hallway door to the toilet. It's exposure to criticism.",Marshall
04x12,It was my head.,Marshall
04x12,We know exactly what you will do.,Leader

04x12,"No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key.",Robin
04x12,"No, certainly not. Reminds me of a bargain between three parties where no one would discuss a certain event happened. An event... persuasion. This key, madam, this is my silence. Good day to you both.",Marshall

04x12,It seems more important than it is.,Robin
04x12,We talked and we realized we had some difficult months.It deserves a little fun.,Ted

04x12,"In fact, Lily was right. We talk about it later.",Ted 
04x12,"We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules.",Robin
04x12,Rule number one: purely physical relationship. There are no feelings.,Ted
04x12,This is like telling Fonzie be cool.,Robin
04x12,"And since it's just physical, it was not to worry love.",Ted
04x12,You can do it watching TV!,Robin
04x12,Absolutely! Let's multitasking. Use sx to spice up the boring activities.,Ted
04x12,As folding laundry.,Robin
04x12,Paying the bills.,Ted
04x12,It's not very hygienic.,Ted
04x12,"Yes, not that one.",Robin
04x12,"And now they sleep together, we argue more.",Robin
04x12,"Problem solved. In fact, the credit goes to Barney. This idea just your thing on the world peace.",Ted
04x12,"Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once.",Robin

04x12,"For one thing, you cry openly.",Lily
04x12,From joy. I am so happy for them.,Barney
04x12,"Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you.",Lily
04x12,I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute.  I'm going quite well.,Barney
04x12,You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.,Lily
04x12,"Wait. If I pay a woman  200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe...",Barney
04x12,I entered.,Lily
04x12,There's something liberating not to take it seriously.,Ted
04x12,Last night we did when I answered the phone.,Robin
04x12,I knew you had not of paddler!,Marshall
04x12,"Wonderful, we still speak of that!",Barney

04x12,It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work.,Robin
04x12,"It was always like that. You remember, in law?",Lily

04x12,That's not what you think.,Marshall
04x12,"It's that, Marshall? What's her name?",Lily
04x12,Burrito. Carnitas Burrito.,Marshall
04x12,Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine?,Robin
04x12,You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.,Marshall
04x12,"Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine.  But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, magazine is read is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, read a magazine that's wank, right?",Barney
04x12,I think so. You still have drank all my milk!,Ted
04x12,We can make love.,Robin
04x12,OK.,Ted
04x12,"This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.",Ted
04x12,Super.,Barney
04x12,"This morning, she cried through the door, You're too long in the shower! . A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.",Ted
04x12,If great.,Barney
04x12,"Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!",Ted
04x12,It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.,Barney
04x12,"So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?",Barney

04x12,The deep structure of the CRT pixel resolution produces unrivaled in LCD.,Seller

04x12,"Barney, it's crazy.",Lily
04x12,"I'm fine, thank you.",Barney
04x12,"No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. The time for emotions, every Tuesday morning.",Lily
04x12,"Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better.",Barney
04x12,"Meanwhile, Marshall always drooled at work.",Ted 
04x12,"Listen all, big breakfast this morning. You know what that means.",Magazine
04x12,Then came the best news he had heard long ago.,Ted 
04x12,Are you aware? They fired everyone in the eighth.,Woman
04x12,I know. This is a ghost town there.,Man
04x12,Hello.,Ted
04x12,Hello.,Robin
04x12,It was fun last night.,Ted
04x12,"Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often.",Robin
04x12,"Okay, see you later.",Ted
04x12,"Last night, Robin left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had sx three times.",Ted
04x12,OK.,Marshall
04x12,And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed.,Ted
04x12,Bizarre. It's weird.,Marshall
04x12,What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement. She probably thinks that I have feelings for her.,Ted
04x12,Do you have any?,Marshall
04x12,"Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man.",Barney
04x12,No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.,Ted
04x12,Clearly. This is the end.,Barney
04x12,Wait. Maybe she has not found it weird.,Marshall
04x12,"It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre.",Robin
04x12,That's not how it is written.,Lily
04x12,"Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted.",Robin
04x12,"I warned you. When ex relapse, ultimately, it hurts someone. But nobody is listening. This is the story of my life.My nice face that prevents people listen to my message.",Lily
04x12,What do I do?,Robin
04x12,"A single solution. You must stop sleeping together, please.",Barney
04x12,"I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it.",Robin
04x12,I have to stop it.,Ted
04x12,"So, you stop that, huh?",Robin
04x12,I think so.,Ted
04x12,"This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird.",Robin
04x12,I do not either.,Ted

04x12,This one.,Barney
04x12,It did not last long.,Ted
04x12,"Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan.",Robin
04x12,That was the case.,Marshall
04x12,"Everything was going well. I felt more and more comfortable, more confident. I could conquer the world. One morning I'm in the eighth with a magazine.",Marshall
04x12,"We will demolish everything. I want that you will destroy these walls, here... and there.",Man 1
04x12,It works.,Male 2

04x12,It did not last long.,Marshall
04x12,Thank you.,Barney
04x12,What are you doing?,Ted
04x12,"Because of your bickering roommates are always a source of conflict between you two, I wanted to help. In fact, I went to the post. I took you stamps. In about 10 000. That should be enough.",Barney
04x12,"Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?",Ted
04x12,I took it in passing. It's nothing.,Barney
04x12,You have bought us a dishwasher?,Ted
04x12,It has always been there. You've been here how long?,Barney
04x12,"So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?",Ted
04x12,Exactly. I worry about you.,Barney
04x12,"It bothers you that we sleep together, right?",Ted
04x12,Not at all. It's crazy. What?,Barney
04x12,You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.,Ted
04x12,What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?,Barney
04x12,Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.,Ted
04x12,I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus.,Barney
04x12,That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?,Ted
04x12,"No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls.",Barney
04x12,Are you sure?,Ted
04x12,Yes!,Barney
04x12,Positive?,Ted
04x12,Absolutely.,Barney
04x12,"And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke.",Barney
04x12,Get out of here.,Lily
04x12,"But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division.",Barney

04x12,Just.,Barney
04x12,"Come on, I'm hungry.",Robin

04x13,"Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?",Ted
04x13,"If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required.",Barney

04x13,Seriously?,Ted
04x13,I can trust you.,Carl
04x13,"To find out what it meant to have the keys to the bar, I must revert back to the night when I released five little words that everyone says at one point in his life.",Ted

04x13,Kiss like rabbits?,Ranjit
04x13,No.,Lily
04x13,"All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette.",Robin
04x13,Maybe you think it's stupid because you've never had a relationship that lasts long enough for that.,Marshall
04x13,What?,Robin
04x13,You know nothing of love. You're like a robot that someone would cry and say that... Why this human leaking?,Marshall

04x13,You know what will happen?,Marshall
04x13,"You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club Snob love.",Robin
04x13,"We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen.",Marshall
04x13,Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go.  It's been what?,Robin
04x13,It was earlier called for the drink of Seattle.,Lily

04x13,A car.,Ranjit
04x13,"Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules.",Marshall
04x13,Close your eyes.,Robin

04x14,"Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo.",Barney

04x15,Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?,Barney

04x15,It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.,Marshall

04x15,I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call.,Grant
04x15,"I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years.",Robin
04x15,"Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose.",Grant
04x15,I have not had surgery.,Robin
04x15,That's it. Neither do I.,Grant

04x15,"Yeah, I was rather a drag.",Loretta
04x15,I'm sorry?,Lily
04x15,"A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet.  Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive.",Loretta
04x15,Barney Mom? Loretta.,Marshall
04x15,"Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect.",Loretta
04x15,"You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.",Marshall
04x15,"No, no question. The truth would kll her.",Barney
04x15,"I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?",Marshall
04x15,"Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven.",Lily
04x15,She was joking.,Marshall
04x15,"She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.",Lily
04x15,You're going to say what?,Marshall
04x15,Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?,Lily
04x15,On the bed race car?,Barney

04x15,Meatloaf? Tyler to love!,Tyler
04x15,We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!,Barney
04x15,But it's funny.,Grant
04x15,I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.,Barney
04x15,Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?,Robin
04x15,Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.,Barney
04x15,What kind?,Robin
04x15,"And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.",Betty
04x15,The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!,Barney
04x15,You better stop!,Betty
04x15,"Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.",Barney
04x15,"So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe?",Betty
04x15,"No, not at all.",Lily
04x15,And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?,Loretta
04x15,"Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?",Barney

04x15,"Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.",Marshall
04x15,"Tyler said: In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that.",Barney
04x15,It was cute.,Loretta

04x15,I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.,Loretta
04x15,No weak link in this scene. Bravo!,Barney
04x15,"Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.",Robin
04x15,You can stop with that?,Marshall
04x15,Go and eat your ice.,Barney
04x15,I can not. I'm lactose intolerant.,Grant
04x15,Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite.,Barney

04x15,I do not understand.,Loretta
04x15,"I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep!",Barney
04x15,I do not want my mom and dad divorced!,Tyler
04x15,What can you have to say for yourself?,Barney
04x15,Rule number one player: Do not be afraid to improvise.,Betty
04x15,"Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?",Ted
04x15,Sorry. What?,Barney
04x15,Rule number 5 player: Invent a rich backdrop for your character.,Betty

04x15,Rule number 8 player: Do not be afraid to come to blows.,Betty
04x15,You know not well what I mean?,Ted
04x15,"No, not at all.",Barney
04x15,"Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!",Ted
04x15,"Mom, you leave us a moment?",Barney
04x15,There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows.,Loretta
04x15,You've lost your mind?,Barney
04x15,You were amazing! You really become that character.,Betty
04x15,"Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.",Ted
04x15,What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?,Barney
04x15,It may be time to tell him the truth.,Lily
04x15,"I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m!",Marshall
04x15,How were my tears?,Grant
04x15,"Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do.",Robin
04x15,It may be like that in your new job.,Grant
04x15,You think so?,Robin
04x15,I know.,Grant

04x15,We are sorry! I thought something was happening.,Grant
04x15,"Honey, you okay?",Loretta
04x15,"Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over.",Barney
04x15,My God!,Loretta
04x15,None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.,Barney
04x15,What?,Loretta
04x15,"I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom.",Barney

04x16,"My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine.",Ted
04x16,Karen is here?,Lily
04x16,You're kidding me!,Barney
04x16,"Children, I think you talked about Karen.",Ted 
04x16,"It was my girlfriend in high school and at times in college. She was beautiful, intelligent. I was crazy in love with her. The only problem, Marshall and Lily were not. It should probably come out of this as soon as we opened.",Ted 
04x16,I like you live in a dorm. It's so American. Like eating rotten sandwiches and be racist.,Karen
04x16,"My God, it was a real idiot.",Lily
04x16,"Dude, the gold medal of the andouille de Vire.",Marshall
04x16,It was not that bad.,Ted

04x16,Get off me!,Marshall
04x16,Wait. It's really funny?,Robin

04x16,Okay.,Marshall
04x16,This morning I was in the gymnasium of the box to play basketball. The guys from work can be quite violent with their taunts.,Marshall
04x16,Look Wisniewski. He will cry. Look at him.,Bilson
04x16,Look at him.,Man
04x16,I think that the knees are made to bend like that. He may have torn his cruciate ligament.,Marshall
04x16,"Dude, all that he has torn, that's her uterus or maybe her hymen.",Bilson
04x16,"Yeah, or the fallopian tube.",Man
04x16,"I can be a bit watered down dialogue, whatever...",Marshall

04x16,I forgot...,Marshall
04x16,He forgot his pants!,Barney
04x16,He forgot his pants.,Barney
04x16,"He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey.",Robin
04x16,"So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no?",Ted
04x16,You can not get back with Karen.,Lily
04x16,I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called?,Ted
04x16,"It is not the worst, no. That would be the fourth worst.1: Super volcano. 2: An asteroid falls to Earth. 3: Any record of Evel Knievel is lost. 4: Ted called Karen. 5: Lily is eaten by a shark.",Marshall
04x16,"My name is Lily and I approve this order. You know the story. Ted and Karen had a rocky relationship in college. It always happened like this. They were having fun, being obnoxious until one day...",Lily
04x16,"You find pepperoni fascist and you're so right, so...  Oh, my God! Karen!",Ted
04x16,"Sorry, dude.",Man

04x16,I broke up with Karen.,Ted
04x16,They hated it!,Lily

04x16,How was it?,Marshall
04x16,Super. Look who's here!,Ted
04x16,Karen.,Marshall and Lily

04x16,"Sorry, dude.",Man
04x16,"She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?",Robin
04x16,Respect.,Barney
04x16,"I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Marshall has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool.",Ted
04x16,I regret it at all.,Marshall
04x16,So you really think that I should not call?,Ted
04x16,No.,Robin

04x16,2: They want to kll you. As my lunch with Wendy.,Barney

04x16,"Ted, darling. Go outside and bite the curb. I arrive in 1 minute.",Lily

04x16,The pants.,Robin

04x16,That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.,Ted
04x16,Why do you say the restaurant? You've embraced elsewhere?,Lily
04x16,"As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?",Ted
04x16,You did what?,Marshall
04x16,How could you?,Barney
04x16,"Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table.",Lily

04x16,"Ted, that's for sure, it's fun to look back when you were a farm girl fresh complexion and a virgin. But all that stuff... Ohio, Karen, in college... it was A.S. Before Stinson. Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your skills are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?",Barney
04x16,What is the result with the bimbo?,Robin
04x16,"It's a foregone conclusion. Ted is Charlie Brown trying to sht and Karen, it's Lucy who takes away the ball at the last second and sleeping with. You have understood me.Ted falls in love, and Karen is going wrong with a playboy, who says... Sorry, dude.",Marshall

04x16,What about you?,Barney
04x16,"Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.",Lily
04x16,"He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has.",Barney
04x16,Awesome. Thank you.,Lily
04x16,And you did not give him.,Ted
04x16,"Theodore Evelyn Mosby. Of course I gave him. I gave him my word. It is concrete. For cons, I made a few alterations.",Barney

04x16,You have a boyfriend?,Ted
04x16,It's a moment you move away. I intended to break.,Karen
04x16,"You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all.",Ted
04x16,"OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel.",Karen
04x16,We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.,Ted

04x16,"You see, children, sometimes when you have to have a difficult discussion, the better to do...",Ted 
04x16,Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?,Lily

04x17,It's almost 2am. I must work.,Robin

04x17,I just said.,Barney
04x17,"I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look.",Robin

04x17,What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.,Ted
04x17,Why I believe you?,Karen
04x17,"Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch.",Ted
04x17,In your face!,Marshall
04x17,Right? I too would have said that.,Ted
04x17,Why I believe you?,Karen

04x17,"It's not an anecdote, it's a porno.",Ted
04x17,"This is not a skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.",Lily
04x17,"But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it.",Barney
04x17,"Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...",Marshall
04x17,"Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, Held danger of Ninja, if you want. You stay still a trnsvstite.",Barney
04x17,I do not care. It's comfortable.,Marshall

04x17,Why was it on your dresser?,Ted
04x17,It is pretty!,Barney
04x17,"I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field...",Ted
04x17,Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break.,Lily
04x17,You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?,Ted
04x17,I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch.,Lily
04x17,What is this test?,Ted
04x17,"You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together.  When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day.",Lily

04x17,"You know not to play bridge, eh?",Barney
04x17,It will take over.,Lily
04x17,It's important to stay active.,Marshall

04x17,Bridge! I won!,"Marshall, old"
04x17,"Fantastic. Yet the bridge. Especially, not reading.","Karen, old"
04x17,"Look, darling... dolphins.","Ted, old"
04x17,"They seem happy. Apparently, the chemical releases of this property have not yet elitist rotten their vents. It will happen. This water will kll you. A real trap toxic.","Karen, old"
04x17,I'm going swimming.,"Lily, old"
04x17,I'm coming with you.,"Marshall, old"

04x17,"You know what? Go ahead, laugh.",Marshall
04x17,Why are you wearing this stuff?,Barney
04x17,Several reasons.,Marshall
04x17,You can not even give five.,Barney
04x17,A: You can not wear anything underneath.,Marshall
04x17,I confirm. You can cross your legs?,Ted
04x17,Two: It's sexy.,Marshall
04x17,I confirm. You can uncross your legs?,Lily
04x17,"Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?",Marshall
04x17,I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.,Barney
04x17,So you're really angry?,Lily
04x17,"I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better.",Ted
04x17,"I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave.",Lily
04x17,Redo? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?,Ted
04x17,Never! Six.,Lily
04x17,Like who?,Ted
04x17,"No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so...",Lily
04x17,... one day she was taking a nap...,Lily
04x17,"Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.",Ted
04x17,That's where is my CD of Creed.,Marshall
04x17,Who else?,Ted
04x17,"Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so...",Lily
04x17,"Look, Ted, you're great, and it is very difficult, but I think it does not look the same. So, long life and prosperity. Or something else.",Woman
04x17,That was you? It's crazy!,Ted
04x17,"Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you.",Lily
04x17,And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?,Ted
04x17,"If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella.",Lily
04x17,Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too?,Ted
04x17,"Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know: you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive.",Lily
04x17,You have made us break up?,Ted
04x17,"You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children.",Lily
04x17,You have made us break up?,Ted
04x17,I did what I had to do.,Lily
04x17,You have made us break up?,Ted
04x17,Just as I did!,Lily
04x17,Your grandfather was a wise Olaf.,Barney
04x17,You made me break with Robin?,Ted
04x17,"No, it's not...",Lily
04x17,I can not believe it. I need another drink.,Ted
04x17,I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.,Barney
04x17,You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.,Marshall
04x17,The Little Barney says Mahalo.,Barney
04x17,"Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?",Ted
04x17,I did it because I care about you!,Lily
04x17,Too glad you watched that one!,"Robin, entering"
04x17,"My God, what has happened?",Barney
04x17,You have not seen the show?,Robin
04x17,The show! Sorry. It happened something?,Barney
04x17,The routine.,Robin
04x17,Lily has just told us it made us break.,Ted
04x17,What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown?,Robin
04x17,A shirt.,Marshall
04x17,It's called a shirt.,Barney
04x17,"It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.",Ted
04x17,"Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch.",Lily
04x17,"2 of heart. As the heart of two children that I have ever had, because my lovely wife hates children.","Ted, old"
04x17,Equality. As my career that fell when I decided to settle down and marry Ted. Bridge! I won.,"Robin, old"
04x17,I do not like this scenario.,Marshall
04x17,I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.,Lily
04x17,I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years? You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years?,Lily
04x17,Where do you see yourself in five years?,Ted
04x17,And you?,Robin
04x17,"Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married.",Lily
04x17,I would probably get married.,Ted
04x17,You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris.,Lily
04x17,I would surely be in Argentina.,Robin
04x17,In Argentina?,Ted
04x17,"Or Tokyo, or Paris.",Robin
04x17,"We have a deadline, does not it?",Ted
04x17,My God.,Robin
04x17,"You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!",Ted
04x17,I was not...,Lily
04x17,I want to hear!,Ted
04x17,Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?,Barney
04x17,"Come, let's check.",Marshall
04x17,"So, without you we would come out still together?",Robin
04x17,"Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends.",Lily
04x17,Do not say that.,Robin
04x17,Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.,Ted
04x17,It is what happened to your jacket?,Lily
04x17,"Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?",Robin
04x17,"You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?",Barney

04x17,"Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.",Marshall
04x17,The coffee too?,Barney
04x17,The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.,Marshall
04x17,"I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?",Barney
04x17,It says you're great and everything will be fine.,Marshall
04x17,It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?,Barney
04x17,"I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ.",Marshall
04x17,"The next night, I always wanted your aunt Lily.Until...",Ted 
04x17,What are you doing...  Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you.,Karen
04x17,"Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily.",Lily
04x17,PS: Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall.,Marshall
04x17,"Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?",Karen
04x17,Do you remember your college roommate? He was married to this girl's voice rattle.,"Karen, old"
04x17,It's been so long.,"Ted, old"
04x17,"My God, I hated him. Finally, here is his obituary.","Karen, old"
04x17,"I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.",Ted
04x17,"So, it's over?",Robin
04x17,"Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove.",Ted
04x17,"beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house.",Robin
04x17,Normal Marshall dies at age 68.,Ted
04x17,Thank you.,Robin
04x17,"And with Robin, we're treated to a gourmet dinner.For her breakfast. And we ended up doing exactly what Lily wanted us to do: talk about our relationship.",Ted 
04x17,"Basically, Lily made us break.",Robin
04x17,It makes you wonder.,Ted
04x17,"If it had not been there, we always go out together?",Robin
04x17,"Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.",Ted
04x17,"We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone...",Robin
04x17,Will you be my wife back?,Ted
04x17,"A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!",Robin
04x17,"Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?",Ted
04x17,Genre?,Robin
04x17,"I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing.",Ted
04x17,Just one thing: no nightgown.,Robin
04x17,I'll never wear.,Ted
04x17,Too bad.,Woman

04x18,Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!,Ted
04x18,There was a problem and his name was Bilson.,Ted 
04x18,"Wood? Natural light? Oh, no! It reminds employees that there is an outside world where they have family and friends. We want to crush it! You arrive in the dark, you come home in the dark. You spend your whole damn day in the dark!",Bilson
04x18,I need to hear Lily.,Marshall
04x18,Who told you to leave?,Bilson
04x18,Bilson klled every one of my original ideas. Then one day the GNB has withdrawn from the project to create a new working group to oversee my plans. Everything changed at once.,Ted 
04x18,"On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.",Ted
04x18,Everything was fine until one day in the elevator.,Ted 
04x18,"Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?",Ted
04x18,"Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try.",Woman
04x18,"Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue.",Barney

04x18,For me it would be Hugh Jackman.,Lily
04x18,"You know, the celebrities, they like really weird sx stuff. Believe me.",Robin
04x18,How do you know that?,Barney
04x18,"It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity.",Robin

04x18,"He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.",Robin
04x18,"No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!",Lily
04x18,"Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.",Marshall
04x18,"But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.",Barney
04x18,"Not you, Barney.",Robin
04x18,Who's who?,Lily
04x18,Now you've spun him hiccups.,Marshall
04x18,"I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.",Robin
04x18,What do you mean collection?,Marshall
04x18,As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.,Robin
04x18,Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.,Barney
04x18,"I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.",Robin
04x18,So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian sx act.,Lily
04x18,Yes.,Robin
04x18,Tell us.,Lily
04x18,I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.,Robin

04x18,Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.,Barney
04x18,"I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?",Ted
04x18,It is said? It should.,Barney
04x18,No. I want to.,Marshall
04x18,There's been no light.,Barney
04x18,What's going on?,Ted
04x18,"It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us.",Marshall
04x18,We abandon the project for the new headquarters. This recession is klling us. It cancels all the superfluous. And I have difficult choices to make during my semi retirement in St. Croix.,Bilson
04x18,"Dude, Ted will be devastated.",Marshall
04x18,Not if he learns his best friend.,Bilson
04x18,I have to say?,Barney
04x18,"Tell him, you're his best friend.",Marshall
04x18,"No, it's you.",Barney
04x18,"No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.",Marshall
04x18,"White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.",Barney
04x18,How are you?,Ted
04x18,You okay?,Marshall
04x18,"I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.",Ted
04x18,You should leave the project.,Barney
04x18,"It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.",Marshall
04x18,It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...,Barney
04x18,"Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.",Ted
04x18,It's funny you mention the project. Because...,Barney
04x18,"You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!",Marshall
04x18,"Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.",Ted
04x18,What was that?,Barney
04x18,I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.,Marshall
04x18,You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.,Barney
04x18,But if I can.,Marshall
04x18,"Lie to me, there.",Barney
04x18,I have a spaceship.,Marshall
04x18,What kind of fuel?,Barney
04x18,I have no spaceship.,Marshall
04x18,"But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.",Barney
04x18,It is what color?,Marshall
04x18,"When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.",Barney
04x18,"My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?",Marshall
04x18,So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.,Ted
04x18,We did it to protect you.,Marshall
04x18,I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.,Ted
04x18,"In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious.",Lily
04x18,This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.,Ted
04x18,"Sorry, Ted.",Marshall
04x18,I need a drink.,Ted
04x18,The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on sx?,Lily
04x18,Not at all.,Marshall
04x18,You've been slow.,Barney
04x18,What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?,Lily
04x18,"Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands.",Robin
04x18,Pack milk Manitoba?,Lily
04x18,"It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi.",Robin
04x18,A Lobster Trap of Newfoundland?,Lily
04x18,"I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy.",Robin
04x18,"Well, I decided my first proposal.",Lily
04x18,"Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection.",Robin
04x18,"Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak.",Lily
04x18,No.,Robin
04x18,"Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.",Barney
04x18,No.,Robin
04x18,"Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake.",Marshall
04x18,No. I would have accepted it.,Robin
04x18,"Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?",Ted
04x18,"Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.",Barney
04x18,So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.,Marshall
04x18,"You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance.  I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money?",Marshall
04x18,How far I have DESAPER?,Roy
04x18,"Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital excutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria.  Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak.",Marshall
04x18,I speak English.,Louisa
04x18,Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say secret in Spanish?,Marshall
04x18,Pellets?,Louisa
04x18,"Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street.  Excuse me. One can argue?",Marshall
04x18,"Actually, my assistant, Reginald took my appointments.",Arty
04x18,It was completed with the group of trainees and paid  50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked...,Marshall
04x18,"Reginald, next week, get me out of here.",Arty
04x18,That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.,Ted
04x18,"Alex Trebek, a Guardian Event, teddy bear!",Lily
04x18,No.,Robin
04x18,Damn!,Lily
04x18,Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.,Ted
04x18,Good job.,Marshall
04x18,All right!,Barney
04x18,Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!,Ted
04x18,"No, I can not. I am engaged to Mr. Barney. We do not care. We live once!",Louisa
04x18,"No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!",Ted
04x18,Is there anything else you want to tell me?,Ted
04x18,When you played third base for the softball team GNB.,Marshall
04x18,"There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.",Barney
04x18,My lap of honor was bogus?,Ted
04x18,"Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that.",Marshall
04x18,Lying?,Ted
04x18,"Sometimes, yes, to protect them.",Marshall
04x18,False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.,Ted
04x18,Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?,Barney
04x18,"You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. Trout. Right? Sturgeon. I think so buddy.Salmon. I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? Bar. This guy is what I mean. Halibut. Thank you, good evening. How do I?",Marshall
04x18,Super. Very funny.,Ted
04x18,Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.,Barney
04x18,Timeout. You do not like fish?,Marshall
04x18,It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.,Ted
04x18,Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.,Marshall
04x18,"It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.",Ted
04x18,"For me, it's called a...",Robin
04x18,A Totem of Saskatoon. It's here.,Lily
04x18,"Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?",Ted
04x18,Nice shirt.,Barney
04x18,You're the devil.,Ted
04x18,"What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor.",Marshall
04x18,"If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?",Ted
04x18,"This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.",Barney
04x18,"Wait, what is a P.T.E.?",Ted
04x18,Room for Transitional Employees.,Barney
04x18,What does that mean?,Ted
04x18,It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.,Barney
04x18,It turns people here.,Marshall
04x18,It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?,Ted
04x18,GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.,Marshall
04x18,It's serious there.,Barney
04x18,"Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key.",Ted 
04x18,"Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call the Renaissance Corridor Quiet. Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life.",Ted
04x18,I love.,Bilson
04x18,Really?,Barney
04x18,"Good job, Ted.",Bilson
04x18,Thank you.,Ted
04x18,You can add these keys to the PTE the 18th floor?,Bilson
04x18,Absolutely.,Ted

04x18,Well.,Robin
04x18,Tell us about it!,Lily
04x18,You really want to know?,Robin
04x18,Yes!,Barney
04x18,But this info does not leave the table.,Robin
04x18,My God. I am so excited.  I will read.,Lily
04x18,Read it.,Barney
04x18,Read it.,Marshall
04x18,"I will read it. Let's go. The Frozen Snowshoe, Old King Clancy, The Plateaux of Harvey.",Lily
04x18,So?,Robin
04x18,I do not understand any of these words.,Lily
04x18,One of them is supposed to be famous?,Barney
04x18,Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?,Marshall
04x18,"This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup.",Robin
04x18,"And fame, this is Harvey Lplateaux?",Marshall
04x18,"No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!",Robin
04x18,So fame was...,Lily
04x18,"The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick The Daredevil at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic.",Robin
04x18,"So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?",Lily
04x18,"Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone.",Robin
04x18,My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.,Lily
04x18,You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?,Barney
04x18,"Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?",Marshall
04x18,I'm more about the project.,Ted
04x18,What?,Marshall
04x18,Bilson fired me.,Ted
04x18,You're kidding.,Marshall
04x18,What does that mean for your company? You're going to be fired?,Lily
04x18,"Actually, I just resign.",Ted
04x18,Why?,Marshall
04x18,"I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your working group, I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.",Ted
04x18,"They've turned, eh?",Barney
04x18,"Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box.",Ted
04x18,It's exciting.,Lily
04x18,With this economy?,Barney
04x18,"So, do we want it?",Marshall
04x18,"Ultimately, I am grateful.",Ted
04x18,What was it with Bilson?,Barney
04x18,"After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.",Ted
04x18,You've hit with a chair?,Barney
04x18,Yeah.,Ted
04x18,Well done.,Barney
04x18,"That one, I got to the restaurant between Milverton and Wawa.",Man
04x18,"It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.",Robin
04x18,We're friends. Call me racket. Sit down.,Man
04x18,So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?,Robin
04x18,You should go.,Snowshoeing
04x19,You believe not what happened last night laser tag.,Barney
04x19,People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?,Ted
04x19,"Yeah, almost.",Barney
04x19,Go! You want that!,Barney
04x19,My shoulder!,Girl

04x19,"Stinson, in my office! Now!",Pattern
04x19,Shit.,Barney
04x19,"Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!",Pattern
04x19,"I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!",Barney
04x19,"Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.",McCracken
04x19,You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.,Barney
04x19,My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.,Barney
04x19,"I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck shting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!",McCracken
04x19,You regret it.,Barney
04x19,"It's over, Stinson. You are banned for life!",McCracken
04x19,I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?,Marshall
04x19,What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.,Barney
04x19,"Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.",Ted
04x19,"Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle.",Barney
04x19,"Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.",Ted
04x19,No list of Murtaugh.,Barney
04x19,What is the Murtaugh list?,Robin
04x19,The Murtaugh list was created around my 30th birthday. It all started with the beer funnel your uncle.,Ted 
04x19,"... two, one, chug!",Marshall
04x19,"Detective Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover in the masterpiece 1987: Lethal wapon, known for his often repeated motto:","Ted  Then one day, in the suffering of the worst hangover of my life, I realized that one person in the world understood me"
04x19,I'm too old for this...,Roger Murtaugh
04x19,"Stuff. He said, I'm too old for this stuff.",Ted 
04x19,"It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.",Ted
04x19,I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
04x19,Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.,Ted
04x19,I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
04x19,Or put posters on the wall without a frame.,Ted
04x19,"Riggs. I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal wapon?",Marshall
04x19,"I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is klled by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta...",Robin
04x19,I gotta go.,Marshall
04x19,"Hi, baby. Good workout.",Lily
04x19,What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap.,Robin
04x19,"In fact, Marshall was to coach the basketball team's class Lily. He thought it was funny, but Lily was dizzy: training father.",Ted 
04x19,My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?,Marshall
04x19,I could not resist. I wanted to see Marshmallow coach at work.,Lily
04x19,"The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?",Marshall
04x19,Yeah!,All
04x19,"Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little shits, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! su1c1de, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.",Marshall
04x19,"There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.",Barney
04x19,"Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.",Ted
04x19,"Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.",Barney
04x19,And if you fail?,Ted
04x19,I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.,Barney
04x19,"It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?",Ted
04x19,An agreement of honor!,Robin
04x19,"Come on guys, you do it!",Barney
04x19,Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.,Robin
04x19,"There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?",Ted
04x19,"To pierce the ear. Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother.  Do you mind if I use your futon?",Barney
04x19,There is no futon.,Robin
04x19,"Put it there, guys.",Barney
04x19,What's the matter?,Robin
04x19,It's on the list. Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel.,Barney
04x19,I'm too old for this stuff.,Robin
04x19,You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.,Ted
04x19,"What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, pushing a medical on the list.  Hold on. Bar here...",Barney
04x19,"It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things.  you not being there! You fall!",Marshall
04x19,"The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.",Ted 
04x19,Done.  Drinking shots with strangers. Done.,Barney
04x19,"OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.",Ted
04x19,"No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth!  You should have a straw?",Barney
04x19,There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?,Robin
04x19,"This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.",Ted
04x19,"It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.",Robin
04x19,"I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.",Ted
04x19,"Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?",Lily
04x19,"I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.",Marshall
04x19,Winning? There are no points.,Lily
04x19,What?,Marshall
04x19,There are no points.,Lily
04x19,"You not count... What interest not to do? How do you know... Lily, what were you doing with the team before I arrive?",Marshall
04x19,I was training.,Lily
04x19,That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light.,Lily
04x19,What's the score?,Boy
04x19,Gender: joy joy!,Lily
04x19,"Because that's the point of playing, having fun.",Lily
04x19,"The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?",Marshall
04x19,"Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one.",Lily
04x19,Everything that's Chinese to me.,Marshall
04x19,"Hi, this is Barney.",Barney
04x19,And Robin.,Robin
04x19,We can not answer because...,Barney
04x19,He watches football and I'm...,Robin
04x19,"Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded...",Barney
04x19,... soon...,Robin
04x19,... we...,Barney

04x19,"Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay.",Barney
04x19,Your ear begins to feel.,Robin
04x19,It's good.,Barney
04x19,"I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.",Ted
04x19,Okay. It's good. You have your own list.,Robin
04x19,What?,Ted
04x19,A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.,Robin
04x19,"Removes colonoscopy and sleeping with an old, and is a cinch.",Ted
04x19,"New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.",Barney
04x19,"Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.",Ted
04x19,Bet held.,Barney
04x19,An agreement of honor!,Robin
04x19,"Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.",Lily
04x19,Sure. I learned that way.,Marshall
04x19,Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?,Lily
04x19,"Come on, Dad. I'm tired.",Marshall
04x19,Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled.,Father
04x19,I'm trying.,Marshall
04x19,I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.,Father
04x19,"With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching!",Marshall
04x19,Put on reading glasses. Done. Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. With pleasure.  What happened to you?,Ted
04x19,I just had a little screw up my knee and it hurts incident.,Barney
04x19,How did you do?,Ted
04x19,It... Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer.,Barney
04x19,Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.,Robin
04x19,16 pm! Supper time.,Ted
04x19,"Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.",Lily
04x19,"Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.",Marshall
04x19,"OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?",Lily
04x19,There are different...,Marshall
04x19,Is that clear?,Lily
04x19,"Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...",Marshall
04x19,Ted Calls. I want to go.,Barney
04x19,Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened.,Robin
04x19,Got up at 4am... Done.,Ted

04x19,Done.,Ted
04x19,"I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun.",Marshall
04x19,"Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that.",Ted 
04x19,"Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not sht! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?",Marshall
04x19,"I'm no referee, but Kenny. And watch your tone.",Referee
04x19,"No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.",Marshall
04x19,"As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.",Robin
04x19,"No, he remains a. The beer funnel.",Barney
04x19,"It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.",Ted
04x19,The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?,Robin
04x19,"Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.",Ted
04x19,"No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is klling me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is...  30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.",Barney
04x19,"You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal wapon.",Ted
04x19,"I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal wapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal wapon 4, I realized...",Ted
04x19,"... that Murtaugh kept repeating: I'm too old for this stuff, but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.",Ted
04x19,And then the hospital.,Barney
04x19,"Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.",Marshall
04x19,"What are we doing wrong, coach?",Boy
04x19,"You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.",Marshall
04x19,"Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation.",Ted 
04x19,Do not look at me like that.,Lily
04x19,I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!,Marshall
04x19,Stop yelling at me!,Lily
04x19,I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?,Marshall
04x19,"OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.",Lily
04x19,"Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf.",Ted 
04x19,There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.,Marshall
04x19,"They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.",Lily
04x19,"It was not a market, right? You're klling me! You kll me outright!",Marshall
04x19,"Attention, coach, or I put a technical foul.",Kenny
04x19,I beg you to put me in one.,Marshall
04x19,"When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation.",Ted 
04x19,I understand that you like it not.,Lily
04x19,I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.,Marshall
04x19,"I know, baby.",Lily
04x19,Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.,Marshall
04x19,Thank you. Yours is.,Lily
04x19,My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.,McCracken
04x19,Really?,Barney
04x19,"Good God, no! I call the police! Major cons with pink hair that dangle from the PQ. Are you kidding. I'm too old for this...",McCracken
04x19,Stuff. He said Stuff.,Ted 
04x20,I heard a joke at work.,Barney
04x20,"Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.",Ted
04x20,"It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.",Barney
04x20,Do it yourself.,Marshall
04x20,Tell it.,Lily
04x20,Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?  It's funny.,Barney
04x20,For the guys.,Ted
04x20,She will not like it.,Marshall
04x20,Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?,Lily
04x20,"Can Barney gave the fall. To date, it remains the most disgusting joke I have ever heard in my life. And no, I do not say.",Ted 
04x20,"Yeah, I can not hang out with you.",Lily
04x20,Come on. It's funny. This is...,Barney
04x20,I told you so.,Ted
04x20,She'll be back.,Barney
04x20,And we saw more Lily for 4 weeks.,Ted 
04x20,"The children, after being fired, I finally realized my lifelong dream: to create my own architectural firm. I had just customers.",Ted 
04x20,I think it's great that you fly with your own wings. I admire that.,"Robin, out of the room"
04x20,Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.,Ted
04x20,"Yeah, sure. Anything you want.",Robin
04x20,"A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?",Ted
04x20,It's not work!,Robin
04x20,"Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!",Ted
04x20,"I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs.",Robin
04x20,I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.,Ted
04x20,You know for layoffs?,Barney
04x20,"Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?",Marshall
04x20,"Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.",Barney
04x20,I would like to have your insurance.,Marshall
04x20,You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.,Barney
04x20,I work harder than anyone in my division.,Marshall
04x20,Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.,Barney
04x20,What do you mean something?,Marshall
04x20,"You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.",Barney
04x20,"Marcus Denisco worked in accounting, and it was probably the worst employee of the box.",Ted 
04x20,I brought donuts. They are probably stupid.,Marcus
04x20,"But ultimately, it was called...",Ted 
04x20,Chow-man!,All
04x20,Who wants pork barbecue? Of course you want!,Marcus
04x20,I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?,Marshall
04x20,It's always food.,Barney
04x20,It's always food.,Marshall
04x20,You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.,Barney
04x20,I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.,Marshall
04x20,"Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man.",Barney
04x20,"Bad news. As HR, I must review the new overtime policy with you. The good news is that we will do with Wolverine's claws!  Section 5A: doing overtime will no longer be paid double.",Toy-Man
04x20,That's great!,Marshall
04x20,Claw tape!,Barney
04x20,I love Toy-man.,Marshall
04x20,You see? You need something. Youtube-like man.,Barney
04x20,You're right. I need something.,Marshall
04x20,But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.,Barney
04x20,You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.,Barney
04x20,"Hi, dude.","Massage man, massaging the shoulders of Marshall"
04x20,"Hi, Douglas.",Marshall
04x20,You're so tense.,Douglas
04x20,"I was relaxed, two seconds ago.",Marshall
04x20,You're next.,Barney
04x20,Welcome to Mosbius Designs.,Man
04x20,Who are you?,Robin
04x20,"PJ, the assistant of Mr. Mosby.",Man
04x20,What's going on?,Robin
04x20,Sorry. You do not interrupt Mr. Mosby during his hours of reflection.,PJ
04x20,"Good, PJ. This is Robin. She lives here.","Ted, by phone at PJ interposed"
04x20,"Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. You need something else?",PJ
04x20,I would not refuse a cup of coffee.,Ted
04x20,You're right next door!,Robin
04x20,So now Ted is assisted to do nothing.,Robin
04x20,"PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind.",Ted
04x20,"Yes, the guide.",Robin
04x20,I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.,Ted
04x20,"I will. Thank you very much, Mr. Mosby.",Man
04x20,All right.,Ted
04x20,This table just told me that you're an idiot.,Robin
04x20,This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.,Robin
04x20,"I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.",Ted
04x20,"Okay, but PJ does not help.",Robin
04x20,"If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere.",Barney
04x20,You see? It is useful.,Ted
04x20,"PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you fck?",Barney
04x20,"No, I guide him.",Ted
04x20,"A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?",Barney
04x20,Ted Mosby?,Ted
04x20,"Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead! PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me.",Barney
04x20,"I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?",Marshall
04x20,Fired. What else you got?,Barney
04x20,I have others. Ties-Fun-man.,Marshall
04x20,Fired.,Barney

04x20,Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.,Marshall
04x20,Not bad. You got maybe something.,Barney
04x20,Great! Great! I Simulates-man!,Marshall
04x20,"Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.",Barney
04x20,"OK, guys?",Man
04x20,"Hi, Frank.",Barney
04x20,"Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time.  This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?",Ted
04x20,"At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together.",Robin
04x20,Inspiration... do your work.,Ted
04x20,"Each time, chief. Every time.",PJ
04x20,"Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?",Robin
04x20,"No idea, but probably the taste of engineering.",PJ
04x20,It's locked?,Robin
04x20,Visitors must register for the key.,PJ
04x20,"Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?",Robin
04x20,I tell you that you must ask permission to use the toilet in my premises.,PJ
04x20,Why does it excite me?,Robin
04x20,There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?,Ted
04x20,"When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?",Robin
04x20,"I distribute the newspaper, it's dirty but someone has to do. Do not worry, I wash them before you fiddle with the parties.",Man
04x20,I live with my mom. In the evening they watch TV in bed.It's called The club hugs.,Man
04x20,"So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?",Robin
04x20,"Look, we'll do it or not?",Man
04x20,"First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity.",Ted
04x20,What productivity? You did not call a single customer.,Robin
04x20,"Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call.",Ted
04x20,Seminar?,Robin
04x20,Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.,PJ
04x20,Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.,Barney
04x20,"It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money.",Marshall
04x20,"Good job, Sport-man. That's last week.",Grub-man
04x20,"60, 80, 100.  18 000 in cash. It's nothing. I'll bring it home and put them in a safe place.  OK, walk down the street with money in his pocket. Not touch the money. It's so obvious. Be natural. The baby looks at me.Babies can smell money. It is known! I carry a lot of money!",Marshall
04x20,"Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.",Marshall
04x20,Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.,Barney
04x20,A waste?,Marshall
04x20,Last week!,Barney
04x20,This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?,Marshall
04x20,"Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant.",Ted
04x20,"This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.",Robin
04x20,"I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!",Barney
04x20,"Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?",Marshall
04x20,Because it hurts!,Barney
04x20,How so?,Marshall
04x20,It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.,Barney
04x20,"I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.",Marshall
04x20,"It's funny anyway, right?",Barney
04x20,It's very funny.,Marshall
04x20,"Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.",Ted
04x20,You know what? I had to send the wrong photo.,PJ
04x20,"You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a shting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.",Ted
04x20,You can not fire me...,PJ
04x20,You're fired.,Ted
04x20,Well!  The Wheel of Fortune.,PJ
04x20,I like having all this time to spend with you book. I'll kiss you there... And there... And here and there. And...,PJ
04x20,One more.,Robin
04x20,Stop.,Ted
04x20,I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you.,PJ
04x20,I'll miss you too.,Robin
04x20,You've already tired of him.,Ted
04x20,"It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream.",Robin
04x20,It's the dream? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?,Ted
04x20,"I have to stop, right? I know not break.",Robin
04x20,"I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you.",PJ
04x20,"Listen... Dude, I know.",Robin
04x20,What?,PJ
04x20,"Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?",Robin
04x20,It's on what?,PJ
04x20,I feel it.,Robin
04x20,Do you not feel anything?,PJ
04x20,But friends and others.,Robin
04x20,"My God, this is the worst break.",Ted
04x20,You're breaking up with me?,PJ
04x20,"If this is what you want, I totally understand.",Robin
04x20,You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.,Toy-man
04x20,"You see, Sports-man. People adore you.",Barney
04x20,"I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow.",Marshall
04x20,"Hi, dude. We need you to do this exchange, I can prepare my team. You are really tight, is it not?",Douglas
04x20,"Seriously, it's over.",Marshall
04x20,I stop?,Douglas
04x20,No.,Marshall
04x20,"With the breakdown of Robin and PJ, I was free to change the personnel office.",Ted 
04x20,Welcome Mosbius Designs.,PJ
04x20,Are you kidding?,Robin
04x20,Now that PJ came back to work...,Ted 
04x20,Are you kidding?,Ted
04x20,"Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.",Marshall
04x20,You're kidding!,Barney
04x20,How are you?,Marshall
04x20,"As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...",Barney
04x20,I know you're in love with Robin.,Marshall
04x20,What?,Barney
04x20,Lily told me.,Marshall
04x20,She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.,Barney
04x20,"Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.",Marshall
04x20,Really?,Barney
04x20,It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.,Marshall
04x20,"Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.",Barney
04x20,Tell her how you feel?,Marshall
04x20,"No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.",Barney
04x20,I can perhaps help you.,Marshall
04x20,"You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.",Barney
04x20,"Meanwhile, I thank you without fight against Robin and PJ continued.",Ted 
04x20,I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?,Ted
04x20,I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?,Robin
04x20,"Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss.",PJ
04x20,Manny Ramirez is not exchange against two replacements!,Chow-Man
04x20,"If you put your veto, I am going!",Toy-man
04x20,I'll find something.,PJ
04x20,"Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.",Barney
04x20,Are you okay?,Robin
04x20,And if I did not think the books?,Ted
04x20,Sorry?,Robin
04x20,"There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?",Ted
04x20,"No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.",Robin
04x20,"The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.",Ted
04x20,"You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious. And apparently, I just... In my apartment. You thought that you would have understood, now?",Robin
04x20,"Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.",Ted
04x20,You can do it.,Robin
04x20,"Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.",Ted
04x20,It looks good.,Robin
04x20,I looked confident?,Ted
04x20,Now known as a real customer.,Robin
04x20,Great.,Ted
04x20,"Hey, Chow-man!",Marshall
04x20,"Hey, Toy-man!",Barney
04x20,Who's this guy?,Marshall
04x20,He is not here. I think we should leave.,Barney
04x20,Really?,Marshall
04x20,It's happened before.,Barney
04x21,Super. So I'll call you.,Ted
04x21,I hope so.,Woman
04x21,Look at this.,Marshall
04x21,I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.,Ted
04x21,"Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.",Barney
04x21,"Yeah, it's true.",Marshall
04x21,"And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.",Barney
04x21,You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do you remember me? It's been a . It's funny because I just saw.,Ted
04x21,You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.,Barney
04x21,"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, you like him, you call him.",Ted
04x21,Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.,Barney
04x21,"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?",Ted
04x21,Jesus.,Barney
04x21,"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.",Marshall
04x21,"Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: Jesus, are you? And Jesus would probably have said, You okay? I died yesterday! And they would say: You have the air alive, man.  And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, Okay, whatever you want, dude.",Barney
04x21,The dialogues seem pompous old now.,Robin
04x21,"And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.",Barney
04x21,"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.",Ted
04x21,"And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, No, Jesus died. Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the tope there! 3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.",Barney
04x21,Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.,Ted
04x21,What was that?,Robin
04x21,What?,Ted
04x21,You made a noise.,Robin
04x21,"This is my laptop, a text message.",Ted
04x21,Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.,Robin
04x21,What?,Ted
04x21,"When you see a naked girl, you make noise.",Robin
04x21,That's not true.,Ted
04x21,Really?,Robin
04x21,"Sorry, Lily.",Ted
04x21,"While the men hunt, women of the Korowai tribe native wash their clothes in the river.",Voice
04x21,It's a breast.,Ted
04x21,This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?,Robin
04x21,"To call. Texting, it's different.",Ted
04x21,"Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.",Robin
04x21,I make no noise.,Ted
04x21,Really?,Robin
04x21,"Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect.",Ted 
04x21,Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.,Ted
04x21,"Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.",Robin
04x21,How do you know?,Ted
04x21,"Because no woman in history has never, asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader.",Robin
04x21,"Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.",Ted
04x21,What?,Robin
04x21,She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.,Ted
04x21,"Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.",Robin
04x21,Come down.,Ted
04x21,And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.,Robin
04x21,Hi guys! What is it?,Robin
04x21,A meal that I Generro back to Lily.,Marshall
04x21,Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!,Robin
04x21,What?,Barney
04x21,You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?,Robin
04x21,"We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.",Barney
04x21,"We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.",Marshall
04x21,Piti texting?,Barney
04x21,"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.",Marshall
04x21,Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.,Barney
04x21,It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.,Marshall
04x21,It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look cowboy sexy.,Barney
04x21,It's better.,Marshall
04x21,I wear them right now and they are very sexy.,Ted
04x21,He put the boots!,Barney
04x21,He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.,Marshall
04x21,Or... we remove our shirts.,Barney
04x21,It's better.,Marshall
04x21,"Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.",Barney
04x21,I believe that wearing anything underneath.,Marshall
04x21,It is hot.,Barney
04x21,"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!",Marshall
04x21,Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?,Barney
04x21,I think we'll... have sx with Ted.,Marshall
04x21,You did this all day? This is wicked.,Robin
04x21,"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.",Marshall
04x21,"The crazy eyes, I'm going too fast and I will fck up everything.",Barney
04x21,The same he had with you the first time.,Marshall
04x21,We all know what it gave.,Barney
04x21,I'm in love with you.,Ted
04x21,What?,Robin
04x21,"I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean.",Robin
04x21,It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say I love you when he contacted her.,Marshall
04x21,And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.,Barney
04x21,First: he jokes with the marriage.,Marshall
04x21,You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what?,Barney
04x21,Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.,Marshall
04x21,I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR.,Barney
04x21,Third: it says too early personal things.,Marshall
04x21,My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR.,Barney
04x21,And he really knows not what means MDR.,Robin
04x21,"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say I love you as easily as we thought.",Marshall
04x21,And then we met Stan.,Barney
04x21,Why do you so much noise?,Stan
04x21,"So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.",Marshall
04x21,"Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug.",Stan
04x21,Super Stan. Who is it?,Robin
04x21,A guard who works nights.,Barney
04x21,He eats here every day.,Marshall
04x21,And he had not finished.,Barney
04x21,Far from it.,Marshall
04x21,"I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you.",Stan
04x21,It's... really nice.,Marshall
04x21,No matter. It's OK.,Barney
04x21,"And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces.",Holly
04x21,Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now.,Stan
04x21,You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.,Marshall
04x21,"I do not ask someone to explain the night. I wait and it envelops me. And you're like bread, light and shadow.",Holly
04x21,This is Pablo Neruda.,Stan
04x21,"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.",Marshall
04x21,"Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you.",Barney
04x21,That's cool. Still nothing?,Stan
04x21,It is perhaps not in love with us.,Marshall
04x21,How is this possible? It's all there waiting!,Barney
04x21,I do not understand men.,Marshall
04x21,I go to work.,Stan
04x21,Do... you come back?,Marshall
04x21,"I'll be back when the wind, destiny and luck will take me back. That is to say tomorrow. This is the day of the cheesesteak.",Stan
04x21,That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?,Robin
04x21,All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.,Barney
04x21,"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?",Robin
04x21,Yes.  Or...,Barney
04x21,"Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.",Ted
04x21,Really? How she explained the scope of texting?,Robin
04x21,"Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.",Ted
04x21,Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.,Robin
04x21,"And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.",Ted
04x21,You cling to Barney and Marshall.,Robin
04x21,What?,Ted
04x21,"They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall.",Robin
04x21,"Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?",Ted
04x21,I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.,Robin
04x21,It's true.,Ted
04x21,"Yes, it was them.",Robin
04x21,Incredible!,Ted
04x21,I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.,Robin
04x21,Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.,Ted
04x21,"I see. Why not: I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live?",Robin
04x21,"Not bad. And: I klled a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface?",Ted
04x21,I love this thing someone said about three months to live.,Robin
04x21,I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend.,Ted
04x21,"It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live.",Robin
04x21,Wait. I think I have.,Ted
04x21,"He replied! I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway.",Marshall
04x21,"That's it, man. This is the I love you.",Barney
04x21,I would like Stan to be there.,Marshall
04x21,Stan. What?,Barney
04x21,I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.,Marshall
04x21,I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.,Barney
04x21,"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?",Marshall
04x21,Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.,Barney
04x21,"Dude, I'm his best friend.",Marshall
04x21,"Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state.",Barney
04x21,"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.",Marshall
04x21,I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.,Barney
04x21,"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?",Marshall
04x21,I know. It's weird.,Barney
04x21,"Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.",Barney
04x21,"And by me, he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.",Marshall
04x21,"So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?",Robin
04x21,Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?,Marshall
04x21,"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.",Ted
04x21,You can tell us. This is a secure area.,Barney
04x21,Your feelings are quite natural.,Marshall
04x21,That's what happened.,Ted
04x21,"And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects.",Ted 
04x21,"Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.",Ted
04x21,That's it?,Marshall
04x21,No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?,Barney
04x21,"OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?",Marshall
04x21,Of course.,Ted
04x21,"So, the machines... klled everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?",Marshall
04x21,And.. why should I make me one of you?,Ted
04x21,Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.,Barney
04x21,"It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?",Ted
04x21,I loved that he called me right away. It's very romantic.And I do not assoies home to read architectural magazines uniformed cheerleader. I do it naked.,Holly
04x21,Holly and I are going to dinner.,Ted
04x21,I'll meet you outside.,Holly
04x21,Sorry. It was just trying to help you.,Marshall
04x21,"And also, it was really funny.",Barney
04x21,"I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an I.",Ted
04x21,"I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date.",Ted 
04x21,"It's funny! I also love indie music. We should get married. I laugh. Or not? I laugh again. That's it. We go to Brazil together! I saw my doctor this morning, he told me that everything was settled, so I can go. I think I love you.",Holly
04x21,"Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this. When I was your mother's number, I called immediately.",Ted 
04x21,"Hi, friends.",Stan
04x21,You work right?,Barney
04x21,I took leave.,Stan
04x21,Great! We can have fun!,Marshall
04x21,I can not. I have a date. Ready?,Stan
04x21,Yes.,Robin
04x21,What...,Barney
04x21,Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?,Marshall
04x21,"Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?",Barney
04x21,Friends. It's time to say goodbye. We all shared a special afternoon and it's something I cherish. I will never forget you.,Stan
04x21,You know their names?,Robin
04x21,"No. The large, this is Ted?",Stan
04x21,"No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily.",Robin
04x21,OK. Do you like chicken wings?,Stan
04x22,"In May 2009, I was about to have my first big client as an independent architect. I was desperate for this to happen.",Ted 
04x22,"That's what you want, son. It's very simple. Opening a restaurant called Rib Town and it is to have the form... a cowboy hat.",Man
04x22,Everything.,Ted 
04x22,"A hat? This is brilliant. I love it! Nothing better to say delicious as inside a cowboy hat. I tell you, I'm your man. I think being born to draw this building. I... I see.",Ted
04x22,I see it. I see it.  What is it good?,Ted
04x22,All-Nighter?,Robin
04x22,I told them I had a vision for this thing. They want a drawing in a week and I have nothing!,Ted
04x22,It's cute.,Robin
04x22,"Cute? I can draw concert halls and bridges. Bridges so beautiful they could be in museums. And I could draw these museums. But I draw, what instead? Where is my career? A two-story Stetson... with a terrace on the edge. It's a cosmic joke. The universe conspires against me.",Ted
04x22,Did you just need to get out. Take a walk. Pay yourself a bagel.,Robin
04x22,"Yeah, that'll solve everything. I have not slept for 34 hours, but a bagel is the answer. Cinnamon and raisin bagel with some cream. It looks good. I'll buy one.",Ted
04x22,"Take an umbrella. It's going to rain, according Galoshes, our clown-weather.",Robin
04x22,"Your show has a clown to present the weather? It's a bit nase, right?",Ted
04x22,"And this restaurant that you draw, what form it, Hoss?",Robin
04x22,"Okay. You want to fire me from here, I go out. I look forward to seeing what the universe has prepared me.",Ted
04x22,"Children, it's a miracle I've been at this corner.Especially since it would have been easy I'm not there.",Ted 
04x22,"For example, when leaving the apartment, I almost go right instead of left. Why not right? For that, we must go back. As you know, your Aunt Robin had a show.",Ted 
04x22,"Eunice is itself these handbags. They are hand-embroidered silks at best. And each takes months to do. I can not say how long...  Weather, fools!",Robin
04x22,"Hi, everyone! A high pressure system arrives from the west...",Clown
04x22,"On the other hand, I bought a big bag today.",Robin
04x22,"Wait, why did you vomit?",Ted
04x22,You want to know.,Robin
04x22,Come on. Tell me.,Ted
04x22,I'm pregnant.,Robin
04x22,"I will raise this child with you. You're not alone. You can get married if you want, but I want to see other girls, it would be one of those marriages...",Ted
04x22,"Stop! I'm not pregnant. This is an intoxication. I ate something at the restaurant, three hours later, I vomited like a fountain.",Robin
04x22,Where?,Ted
04x22,This is a disgusting issue.,Robin
04x22,Where was your meal?,Ted
04x22,I want to tell you.,Robin
04x22,What?,Ted
04x22,"Go to YouTube. Tape Robin Scherbatsky show vomit. Robin, already gone.",Barney
04x22,Someone has already put on YouTube?,Robin
04x22,Yeah... someone. So... why did you vomit? You're pregnant?,Barney
04x22,"Yeah, I'm pregnant.",Robin
04x22,Why do you not tell me where you got your intoxication?,Ted
04x22,"You adore this place. If I tell you, it will ruin it.",Robin
04x22,It makes sense. Do not say anything.,Ted
04x22,This Indian restaurant where the cat jumps on the tables?,Ted
04x22,I say nothing.,Robin
04x22,The Spanish restaurant with the cradle?,Ted
04x22,I say nothing.,Robin
04x22,Is it here? Tell me!,Ted
04x22,You really want to know? This is Schlegel's Bagels.,Robin
04x22,Why do you have told me? Schlegel's? Thank you! I'll have to find another New York place that serves bagels.,Ted
04x22,"The children, though as usual, I had gone to Schlegel's Bagels, I would have gone right. I would have taken a bagel would be returned to work on this building and you would perhaps never been born. But I went left, towards my second favorite place. And the rest is history. Of course, on the way, I stopped in this booth. Why I got arrested? That's why.",Ted

04x22,I have an appointment with.,Barney
04x22,You are my hero! Really? How did you do?,Ted
04x22,It's not in the story. I waited a long time to say that.This girl... is the daughter.,Barney
04x22,Of course it is. Marry them! It.,Ted
04x22,"Marrying? I have something even more special in mind. Petra, if all goes well, will be my... wait, my 200th! Can not wait. Too exciting.",Barney

04x22,Who I'll lie. I want the highest Tope there.,Barney
04x22,Even if I was wearing protective clothing. 200 is too much!,Ted
04x22,"As if there could be too much of something wonderful.Babe Ruth, gently, my grandfather. Do not hit too many home runs. Steve Guttenberg, you should not do that three Police Academy. America has laughed enough.",Barney
04x22,Who are these girls? It was rhetorical. Show me the list.,Ted
04x22,"199 satisfied customers. Finally, the big night is Thursday. I give a reception before, in McClaren's. Prepares a toast. Tuxedo optional but desired. Gifts are, I would say useless, but follow your heart.",Barney

04x22,It's not too much.,Barney
04x22,That's too!,Ted
04x22,It's not too much.,Marshall
04x22,Thank you.,Barney
04x22,"Do not misunderstand. You're disgusting and the cops should put a shoe on your part, but this number should be higher. After Barney told me about that, I reviewed the figures and... I have some graphics. Barney dredge about 20 girls a week.",Marshall
04x22,It's more than 20. B. Does nothing more precise estimate.,Barney
04x22,"Let 20. So 20 girls a week, that's 1,040 girls a year.In its 16 years of sexual activity, it would mean that he has dredged 16,640 girls. If he has slept with 199, it's a success rate... slightly higher than one per cent. This is an average of 12 hits, eight times worse than average in career... launcher in one hand, the launcher... Jim Abbott.",Marshall
04x22,"Jealous. Jealous. Hero. Strangely silent during this conversation on his number of sexual partners. Hero. The grand total, it is the only number that matters.",Barney

04x22,"Stinson, you're an amateur. I bet you've never done.",Matthew

04x22,"You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice.",Robin
04x22,"So that means... Pauline is not the 199th, it is the 200th?",Barney

04x22,"So, bagel on the way, I stopped a minute in a booth to see the photo of the 200th Barney. If I had not done that, I would have missed the cut by the booth and came 77th in this corner a minute earlier. I would have had the bagel, worked a little, and you children, you would not be born. Why I cut through the 77th and gave a dollar to the homeless? That's why. In the early days of Marshall to Goliath National Bank...",Ted 
04x22,"Fran, I will not bother you, but I have a presentation tomorrow and it would help me if I could have tables and graphs. Can you help me?",Marshall

04x22,What about the graphics.,Barney
04x22,Any visual representation of data.,Ted
04x22,"I'm not stupid. I know what you think of my paintings and graphics. In fact, I made a picture of your reactions to my paintings. See it. Yes, that's true, since Cecilia, your interest in my paintings do not stop falling. But based on recent trends, I also... projection boards! And look... a large peak of interest is coming! And it's not just a blip dead cat. It is a long-term growth.",Marshall

04x22,"Sorry, there is a star of earth?  start.",Marshall
04x22,"If I had not bought these tables for Marshall, I would not be passed by the 77th to give Milt his dollar. In short, you know the rest. And now, children. There are lots of little reasons that great things happen to us. If I knew then that these things take me and how I shall be grateful to them, I probably would have done something like that.",Ted 
04x22,"The next day, Uncle Barney finally confronted Matthew Panning, the stud of the school of Port Richmond.",Ted 
04x22,I slept with 200 women.,Barney
04x22,My God! This is too much. Finally... It's disgusting.Have you thought of consulting as a sx addict? You're the perfect candidate.,Matthew

04x22,I'm awesome. 200. Now what?,Barney
04x23,"Children, Stella was the girl I thought to end my life. Before she left me on the altar, breaking my heart. So, when I cross seven months later, I had only one thing to say.",Ted 
04x23,Stella! Glad to see you again!,Ted
04x23,I do too.,Stella
04x23,And Tony! What a nice surprise.,Ted

04x23,I think you've been great.,Marshall
04x23,"I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake Tope-there.",Barney
04x23,I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future.,Ted
04x23,"And you know, I meant it. But anyway, that night, my mind wandered.",Ted 
04x23,I made a terrible mistake.,Stella

04x23,"Hi, Ted.",Tony
04x23,"No, between. It's not weird at all.",Ted
04x23,"I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad.",Tony
04x23,Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.,Ted
04x23,"You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag.",Tony
04x23,Why are you here?,Ted
04x23,"I know I can be a bit harsh, but I can not bear to have you as many wounded. Fate put me in the street to fix it.Obviously, I can not fill the crater left by Stella in your heart.",Tony
04x23,I met lots of girls.,Ted
04x23,And I know you've been fired.,Tony
04x23,I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy.,Ted

04x23,... your own resume as professor of architecture.,Tony

04x23,"What do you mean no thank you? You'd be a great teacher. You are an expert, you can talk, and when necessary, you can get to grow a beautiful beard.",Marshall
04x23,"I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic.",Ted

04x23,I have done. It was... when? In 1998.,Marshall
04x23,Where's the fire?,Policeman
04x23,"There is no fire. In fact, you know, there's a fire in the barbecue where I go. Nothing special. Burgers, chops...merguez.",Marshall
04x23,You know it's dangerous to go... You said sausages?,Policeman
04x23,"Yeah, merguez. My mother's marinated in beer for 2 days. That's it. It's weird, I could have sworn that what those big, succulent smoked sausages had writing on it. Bizarre.You were saying?",Marshall
04x23,That was writing what? The merguez?,Policeman
04x23,"It said: Ownership of Minnesota police, Jorgensen.You like merguez, Jorgensen agent?",Marshall
04x23,You go to this address? Follow me with the siren.It will burn red lights.,Policeman
04x23,"I would have done that too, if I went to a barbecue.Slim, I went there.",Barney
04x23,It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster.,Marshall
04x23,Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.,Robin
04x23,"You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait.",Barney
04x23,I understand. Ack-Ted. I understood.,Ted
04x23,What now?,Ted
04x23,You wanna be an architect? Super. A guy I was in school wants a new home. The job is yours if you want.,Tony

04x23,"You're wrong about that, man.",Robin
04x23,"Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine.",Barney
04x23,Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had.,Marshall
04x23,This is outrageous! And relevant.,Robin
04x23,"Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK?",Policeman
04x23,Thank you.,Robin
04x23,Excuse me. I left something in New Jersey.,Barney
04x23,How was your lunch with the rich? It started well.,Robin
04x23,"I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall...",Ted

04x23,The laundry room?,Ted

04x23,That's it. A house of horror.,Robin
04x23,"By practicing martial arts, I learned to believe in my instinct and my instinct tells me that... it sounds great.",Tony
04x23,The steak is very rare.,Ted
04x23,Do not you?,Ted
04x23,"One last point, soundproofing. I tend to make much noise when I wash. I'll show you. I'll go in the laundry room and tell me if you hear me.",Man
04x23,"It's a bit serious, huh?",Ted
04x23,Grave well. You hit the nail.,Tony

04x23,"Sorry for this house of horror. It was my fault. It is for me.New plan. My friend, you will build a husband to the Statue of Liberty. I have some knowledge in the town hall.",Tony
04x23,"Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that.",Ted

04x23,Why?,Ted
04x23,"Because... when you were with Stella, I missed her terribly. I can imagine how you feel.",Tony
04x23,"Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy.",Ted
04x23,Okay. A weight less.,Tony

04x23,I'll wait.,Robin
04x23,Why are you here?,Ted
04x23,"Look, Ted, I was 7 months late, but that's how. I'm in love with Tony, since high school. We went out for a long time, and then... I became pregnant and for a 19 year old daughter, it was too much to handle, and it broke. And for a long time, I too thought about my role as mother. I forgot Tony. I forgot...what it was like being in love. Then you came and everything was resurrected. And I loved you for that. I loved you so much, in fact, it was just... enough. But I always liked Tony.",Stella
04x23,"Take it back on, darling. He's sorry.","Woman, leaving her"

04x23,I do not know what else to do. I love it.,Stella
04x23,"You love her? What, you do call my romance? It's your strategy? Because this guy is gone. You can have me over like that. I am attached to nothing, thanks to you.",Ted

04x24,I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages.,Robin
04x24,Really?,Marshall
04x24,No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no.,Robin
04x24,"Boy, you're going to break her... The thing that this black mud pump through his veins.",Lily
04x24,"You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it.",Robin
04x24,"OK, first... Second, there is a trick you can try. It's risky, but it can pay off. Lack of anything better, I'll call it... The Mosby.",Marshall
04x24,The Mosby?,Robin
04x24,"No, she can not mosbyser.",Lily
04x24,It could squarely mosbyser.,Marshall
04x24,What is the Mosby?,Robin
04x24,"Do you remember your first time with Ted? You wanted to get on the train Ted, visit his yard.",Marshall
04x24,I was ready to jump the turnstile.,Robin
04x24,What changed everything?,Marshall
04x24,I think I love you.,Ted
04x24,What?,Robin
04x24,The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me.,Robin
04x24,"You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts.",Marshall
04x24,"So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise.",Barney
04x24,That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.,Lily
04x24,Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great.  So Robin does not like me.,Barney
04x24,No.,Lily
04x24,Why?,Barney
04x24,Mr. Goat?  Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a...,Ted
04x24,"Marshall, you can pick up Ted?",Lily
04x24,I was about to jump. You've not heard saying OK loop?,Marshall
04x24,I'm sorry. Go ahead and jump.,Lily
04x24,"It's good. Sorry, everyone. Lily does not want me jumping.  Thank God.",Marshall
04x24,The hospital!,Ted
04x24,What has happened?,Lily
04x24,It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked.,Ted
04x24,This is the sweetest and adorable goat in the world.,Lily
04x24,The sweetest and adorable goat in the world?,Ted
04x24,"I lacked sleep, it was certainly not like that, but that's how I remember it.",Ted 
04x24,You're the one who wanted to be a goat?,Doctor
04x24,It's the goat jumped on me! Can I go?,Ted
04x24,"Yes. But remember, Bee means bee.",Doctor
04x24,"Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat.",Ted
04x24,Mr. Goat? It's a girl. Her name is Missy.,Lily
04x24,You got beat by a girl.,Marshall
04x24,So... You're in love with me?,Barney
04x24,What? Yes. Much.,Robin
04x24,You can stop. Lily told me everything.,Barney
04x24,"Damn, Lily!",Robin
04x24,I can not believe it.,Barney
04x24,"It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.",Robin
04x24,"Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same.",Barney
04x24,"Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, stifles it in the bud because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.",Robin
04x24,"It's going pretty fast, do not you think?",Barney
04x24,What?,Robin
04x24,We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?,Barney
04x24,Friends.,Robin
04x24,My God. You just do it again. You've mosbys!,Barney
04x24,But no.,Robin
04x24,"But if, little flirtatious.",Barney
04x24,You're right. I've just mosbyser.,Robin
04x24,Why are you scared to try?,Barney
04x24,Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.,Robin
04x24,Bad idea.,Barney
04x24,You're right. There must be a mistake.,Robin
04x24,No.,Barney
04x24,I love you.,Robin
04x24,Friends.,Barney
04x24,"Friends, then.",Robin
04x24,I love you.,Barney
04x24,Let's get married.,Robin
04x24,"No, you're smothering me.",Barney
04x24,"OK, forget it.",Robin
04x24,You know what? We'll see later.,Barney
04x24,"Yeah, let's go.",Robin
04x24,"It was a long and crazy night, but in the morning, against all odds, I made my presentation.",Ted 
04x24,"There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not?",Ted
04x24,"Ted, listen. You are great and you did a... great job, and you'll make other restaurants very happy one day, but... we...decided to go... in another direction.",Man
04x24,What?,Ted
04x24,Treat yourself with... Rib Town!,Man 2
04x24,Sven...,Ted
04x24,"I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.",Marshall
04x24,"Yeah, right.",Barney
04x24,I will not eat.. never... chops! Before Ted!,Marshall
04x24,It's a disaster. How I will recover?,Ted
04x24,"OK, I'm just asking. You really want to recover?",Lily
04x24,What does that mean?,Ted
04x24,"Architecture is klling you and it kills us to see her kll you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want?",Lily
04x24,Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.,Ted
04x24,"In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter.",Lily
04x24,I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am.,Robin
04x24,It continues? Bravo.,Lily
04x24,"What someone looks, please.",Robin
04x24,Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself.,Lily
04x24,"So what, I should do anything?",Ted
04x24,Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap.,Lily
04x24,"You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily.",Marshall
04x24,A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap!,Lily
04x24,Do not do that. Not cool.,All
04x24,I did it!,Marshall
04x24,"Honey, you did it!",Lily
04x24,I can do anything!,Marshall
04x24,It's true!,Lily
04x24,I bought a motorcycle!,Marshall
04x24,"No, not at all!",Lily
04x24,"OK, sorry. Come on, guys.",Marshall
04x24,"This is the year that I was left at the altar. The year I was a bartender tared Knocked The year I got fired. The year I got beat by a goat. A girl goat, and more. Yet it was the best year of my life. Because if this had not happened, I never had the best job of my life. But most importantly, I would not have met your mother, because as you know... It was in this class.Of course, this story is just beginning.",Ted 
05x01,IN. TED'S CLASSROOM,2009
05x01,"Kids, on my first day as a college professor, there were two things I didn't know that I wish did. The first thing was that your mother was in that classroom.",Ted 
05x01,"The second thing? Well, to explain that we have to go back to the beginning of the summer.",Ted 
05x01,"When, after a year of wrestling with their feelings for each other, Barney and Robin finally, well...",Ted 
05x01,Whoo!!!,Lily
05x01,Lily! All we need is your indoor whoo.,Robin
05x01,"Sorry.  Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this!",Lily
05x01,"Yeah, Lily, listen.",Barney
05x01,Barney's awesome.,Robin
05x01,Robin's more than just awe-some. She's awe-quite a bit. She's awe-a whole darn lot.,Barney
05x01,"Wait, what are you saying?",Lily
05x01,We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.,Robin
05x01,Oh yeah.,Barney
05x01,Is it something I did?,Lily
05x01,"Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.",Robin
05x01,"Yeah, It's us. You understand, right?",Barney
05x01,"Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy.",Lily
05x01,We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips.,Lily
05x01,I know. I Know. So... has the boat sailed on sx tonight or...,Marshall
05x01,"After that, the summer went by way too fast. Until all of a sudden, it was the Friday before my first day as a college professor.",Ted 
05x01,Wow! What's this?,Ted
05x01,It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favourite professor of all time.,Marshall
05x01,A fedora!  I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!,Ted
05x01,"That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.",Barney
05x01,You know what we should do? We should...,Ted
05x01,"Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff.",Marshall
05x01,God... you just get me.,Ted
05x01,"OK, I should get going. I got a date.",Robin
05x01,You're still seeing that guy?,Barney
05x01,"Even better, seeing him naked.",Robin
05x01,What!,Barney
05x01,"I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds.",Barney
05x01,"OK Ted, You got first whip!",Marshall
05x01,All right. . What did tell you about smoking in here?,Ted
05x01,"Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him!",Marshall
05x01,I'm so sorry.,Ted
05x01,"It's just the whip's not a toy. There's such a thing as common sense, you know.",Marshall
05x01,You can whip me if you want.,Ted
05x01,"I will, some other time.",Marshall
05x01,Whoo!!!!!!,Lily
05x01,"So, how long has this been going on?",Lily
05x01,All summer.,Barney
05x01,I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.,Lily
05x01,"Wow, wow...",Barney
05x01,Girlfriend?,Barney
05x01,"Slow your roll there, Lilypad.",Robin
05x01,"Yeah, yeah.",Barney
05x01,You've been together all summer. I don't get it.,Lily
05x01,"Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.",Robin
05x01,We should figure out what this is.,Robin
05x01,"Yes, we should. Or. Or...",Barney
05x01,"Okay, now, we have to figure this out.",Robin
05x01,"Yes, we do. Or. Or...",Barney
05x01,We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.,Robin
05x01,"Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, I don't know.",Barney
05x01,"You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.",Lily
05x01,"Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.",Robin
05x01,"Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.",Barney
05x01,"No, no, no . You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.",Lily
05x01,Or. Or...,Barney
05x01,"I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class? I know the board says Professor Mosby, but to you I'm Ted.",Ted
05x01,Question. Awesome. Hit it.,Ted
05x01,"Yeah, here's my question, Ted, who the hell do you think you are?",Blond Girl
05x01,"Yeah Ted, we're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect.",A boy
05x01,"And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?",Another boy
05x01,They're at home. I...,Ted
05x01,And where are your pants?,Another girl
05x01,"Oh, God.",Ted
05x01,"Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...",Ted
05x01,"Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?",Barney
05x01,I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.,Ted
05x01,"Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.",Barney
05x01,"Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.",Marshall
05x01,"I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.",Lily
05x01,Exactly.,Barney
05x01,"If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.",Lily
05x01,Amen.,Barney
05x01,You have to make things clear.,Lily
05x01,Run tell that.,Barney
05x01,Define the relationship.,Lily
05x01,"Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.",Barney
05x01,"Lily, can't you just let us be happy?",Barney
05x01,You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.,Lily
05x01,And that's not happy?,Barney
05x01,Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.,Lily
05x01,Why? Give me one good reason.,Barney
05x01,I'll give you 20...,Lily
05x01,"Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.",Barney
05x01,"I've got two tickets to the Rangers Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...",Brad
05x01,"Euh, oh, hum, heu...",Robin
05x01,What do I have to do? Put a gn to your head? Buy you a six pack?,Brad
05x01,"Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.",Robin
05x01,Why not? You have a boyfriend?,Brad
05x01,"No. No, no boyfriend.",Robin
05x01,Great! It's a date.,Brad
05x01,Hey Barn!,Brad
05x01,Hey Brad.,Barney
05x01,I just thought of a reason.,Lily
05x01,"The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game.",Ted 
05x01,You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.,Robin
05x01,"Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!",Robin
05x01,Not really.,Brad
05x01,"The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.",Robin
05x01,"Oh, man. Is this the talk?",Brad
05x01,What?,Robin
05x01,"No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.",Brad
05x01,"No, Brad, no, it's...",Robin
05x01,"But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.",Brad
05x01,"God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.",Robin
05x01,"You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...",Brad
05x01,"Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says leap into it. My brain says it's a bad idea.",Robin
05x01,Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.,Brad
05x01,We're not gonna have the talk.,Barney
05x01,"Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have sx afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.",Marshall
05x01,I don't think the talk is necessary.,Ted
05x01,What?!,Marshall
05x01,"Thank you, Ted.",Barney
05x01,Because Robin is already his girlfriend.,Ted
05x01,What?!,Barney
05x01,"MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...",Ted
05x01,"How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.",Barney
05x01,Gremlins?,Ted
05x01,"Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them",Barney
05x01,What about brunch? Is brunch cool?,Ted
05x01,"No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.",Barney
05x01,"OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?",Ted
05x01,Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...,Barney
05x01,I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?,Barney
05x01,"Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.",Marshall
05x01,"Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!",Voice
05x01,"Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.",Brad
05x01,Why not? Lay it on me.,Robin
05x01,Hey Brad!,Barney
05x01,"Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!",Barney
05x01,"It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.",Brad
05x01,"Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.",Barney
05x01,That's putting it a bit strongly.,Robin
05x01,A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.,Barney
05x01,"A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?",Robin
05x01,"Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?",Lily
05x01,Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.,Barney
05x01,"Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make",Ted 
05x01,"Wait. Does professor have one F or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two F's. That looks right. I think that's right.",Ted
05x01,"Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.",Barney
05x01,We've been over this. Unless I say flugelhorn you haven't gone too far.,Robin
05x01,"No, I meant punching Brad.",Barney
05x01,"Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...",Robin
05x01,"God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?",Robin
05x01,No.,Barney
05x01,Flugelhorn. Did you do this?,Robin
05x01,"Ted, are you out there?",Robin
05x01,"Ted's not here, Robin.",Lily
05x01,"Lily, let us out of here.",Robin
05x01,I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.,Lily
05x01,Lily! Come on. Let us out!,Robin
05x01,"No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.",Lily
05x01,We are not having the talk!,Barney
05x01,Then you'll die in there.,Lily
05x01,"You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having sx!",Robin
05x01,"Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.",Lily
05x01,"Hey, guys.",Marshall
05x01,I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.,Ted 
05x01,"Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.",Ted
05x01,"Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here . Okay, good luck. Byesies.",Barney
05x01,"This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide.",Ted 
05x01,Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...,Ted
05x01,"Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken",Ted 
05x01,"I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom.",Blond girl
05x01,"Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.",Ted 
05x01,Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.,Ted
05x01,Architect?,A girl
05x01,: We're just hanging out.,Marshall
05x01,Just hanging out? Not good enough.,Lily
05x01,Not good enough!,Marshall
05x01,Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?,Ted
05x01,Economics?,A boy
05x01,"Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.",Ted
05x01,We're seeing where things are going.,Marshall
05x01,I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.,Lily
05x01,Not good enough!,Marshall
05x01,You... Why do you want to be an architect?,Ted
05x01,I don't want to be an architect.,Student
05x01,"Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.",Ted
05x01,No questions!,Ted
05x01,"Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.",Marshall
05x01,Not... good enough.,Lily
05x01,Not good enough!,Marshall
05x01,"So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.",Ted
05x01,Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!,Ted
05x01,"Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats.",Other professor
05x01,"Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?",Ted
05x01,"Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.",Professor
05x01,"Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.",Ted
05x01,"T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.",Student
05x01,"Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.",Ted
05x01,20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.,Lily
05x01,"Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.",Ted
05x01,"That's awesome, Ted.",Lily
05x01,"Congratulations, buddy.",Marshall
05x01,Thanks.,Ted
05x01,"Nice job, Ted.",Robin
05x01,"Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?",Barney
05x01,They still haven't had the talk?,Ted
05x01,I think I know how to speed things up,Marshall
05x01,Not cool!,Robin
05x01,"Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.",Marshall
05x01,"Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.",Robin
05x01,Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?,Barney
05x01,"Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.",Robin
05x01,"I know, right?",Barney
05x01,Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?,Robin
05x01,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend",Barney
05x01,"Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clich, but... he really ruined me for other men.",Robin
05x01,"Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine",Ted 
05x01,Maybe we should go back to being just friends.,Barney
05x01,Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having sx.,Robin
05x01,"Good. Me, neither.",Barney
05x01,Friends isn't gonna work.,Robin
05x01,We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?,Barney
05x01,I know something we're good at.,Robin
05x01,"I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...",Barney
05x01,"No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?",Robin
05x01,Really?,Lily
05x01,Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.,Robin
05x01,"And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.",Barney
05x01,"We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.",Robin
05x01,"And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.",Barney
05x01,And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.,Robin
05x01,She can handle her Scotch.,Barney
05x01,He's my boyfriend.,Robin
05x01,And she's my girlfriend.,Barney
05x01,Good enough!,Marshall
05x01,She bought it.,Robin
05x01,"Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.",Barney
05x01,"Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?",Robin
05x01,"You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.",Barney
05x01,"Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.",Robin
05x01,Flugelhorn?,Barney
05x01,"Yeah, that felt wrong.",Robin
05x01,"You do realize they were lying, right?",Ted
05x01,"No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.",Lily
05x01,Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.,Marshall
05x01,"What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it?",Marshall
05x02,"This is the story of two blind dates. One in 2009... And one seven years earlier. In all that time, my dating routine remained more or less the same... until the fall of 2009, when I finally had a date that was different. Because it was exactly the same. I was on a blind date with the same woman I went on a blind date with seven years earlier.",TED 
05x02,Ted?,Jen
05x02,Jen?,Ted
05x02,It's nice to meet you.,Jen
05x02,And she didn't remember it. But then again...,Ted 
05x02,"It's nice to meet you, too.",Ted
05x02,Neither did I.,Ted 
05x02,Guess who just got four tickets to the Origins of Chewbacca Star Wars exhibit?,Barney
05x02,Why?,Lily
05x02,"No, I said, Guess who?",Barney
05x02,I heard you.,Lily
05x02,"Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?",Robin
05x02,"What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?",Marshall
05x02,"Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?",Barney
05x02,"Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.",Marshall
05x02,"We're not going to the Origins of Chewbacca exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.",Barney
05x02,"Where are you taking me, Barney?",Marshall
05x02,This wasn't the first time your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.,Ted 
05x02,"Wait a second, the Origins of Chewbacca exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?",Ted
05x02,My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.,Barney
05x02,Stop the cab.,Ted
05x02,Where are you taking me?,Marshall
05x02,"Barney, why are we here?",Marshall
05x02,"Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.",Barney
05x02,"Thanks, man.",Marshall
05x02,You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.,Barney
05x02,"Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?",Marshall
05x02,"Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.",Barney
05x02,"Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time.",Ted 
05x02,"So, Jen, what do you do?",Ted
05x02,I'm between jobs banking crisis.,Jen
05x02,I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable... like banking. So what about you?,Jen
05x02,"I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.",Ted
05x02,"I teach architecture. Get 50 off so, that's pretty sweet.",Ted
05x02,Married!,Marshall
05x02,What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.,Barney
05x02,I do! It's just not that easy.,Marshall
05x02,False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.,Barney
05x02,"Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.",Marshall
05x02,Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate.,Doctor
05x02,What?! How could this be?!,Marshall 
05x02,"Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.",Doctor
05x02,"It's time, baby.",Lily
05x02,I will never love again.,Marshall
05x02,"No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.",Lily
05x02,"And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.",Priest
05x02,Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.,Delivery girl
05x02,Where do I sign?,Marshall
05x02,"And then watch out, because it is on!",Marshall
05x02,"That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.",Barney
05x02,"It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.",Marshall
05x02,"I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.",Barney
05x02,"Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine.",Voice
05x02,Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?,Marsahll
05x02,"Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!",Barney
05x02,"Yeah, I can't talk right now.",Ted
05x02,"I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!",Barney
05x02,Stop looking at her.,Marshall
05x02,"Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.",Ted
05x02,"Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.",Barney
05x02,I'll kll you!,Marshall
05x02,Sorry about that.,Ted
05x02,"So, any thoughts on food?",Jen
05x02,"Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?",Ted
05x02,I would love to share the oysters.,Jen
05x02,Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.,Ted
05x02,"Wow, that's bad.",Jen
05x02,That's why it's funny!,Ted
05x02,We've been on this date before.,Ted and Jen
05x02,We've been on this exact blind date before.,Ted
05x02,In this exact same restaurant.,Jen
05x02,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.",Ted
05x02,Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby.,Jen
05x02,"Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.",Ted
05x02,"They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.",Jen
05x02,"Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.",Ted
05x02,"Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?",Jen
05x02,"Well, you've got your cats.",Ted
05x02,This is insane.,Jen
05x02,"Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?",Ted
05x02,"Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there...",Jen
05x02,"Main Lobster. They spelled Maine without the e. Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...",Ted
05x02,"I get it, Ted.",Jen
05x02,Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.,Jen
05x02,Huh. I had no idea.,Ted
05x02,"Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?",Jen
05x02,"That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.",Ted
05x02,Huh. I had no idea.,Jen
05x02,"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",Ted
05x02,"We really are. Okay, I'm in.",Jen
05x02,Great.,Ted
05x02,Where'd we go next?,Jen
05x02,I think we went to MacLaren's.,Ted
05x02,Okay.,Jen
05x02,"Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?",Jen
05x02,"And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.",Jen
05x02,Tone down the kitty talk. Check.,Jen
05x02,You will not believe who we saw tonight.,Barney
05x02,"Dude, um...",Marshall
05x02,We saw the third doppelganger!,Barney
05x02,I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like,Ted 
05x02,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!",Barney
05x02,Lesbian Robin.,Ted 
05x02,"And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that.",Ted 
05x02,"Ladies, meet Stripper Lily.",Barney
05x02,Oh!,Lily
05x02,"Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.",Barney
05x02,So you went to a strip club?,Lily
05x02,Busted.,Barney
05x02,And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?,Lily
05x02,"Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...",Marshall
05x02,"Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.",Lily
05x02,So... Strip club.,Robin
05x02,Marshall made me go.,Barney
05x02,"All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.",Ted
05x02,"Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.",Jen
05x02,"It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?",Jen
05x02,Not really.,Ted
05x02,Really? I can't feel my fingers.,Jen
05x02,I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,Ted
05x02,I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.,Ted
05x02,"After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.",Jen
05x02,I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.,Ted
05x02,"Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?",Jen
05x02,See? Why didn't you lead off with that?,Ted
05x02,Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.,Lily
05x02,"See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.",Barney
05x02,I'm not cool with it.,Robin
05x02,Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,Barney
05x02,It's disgusting.,Robin
05x02,Because it's harmless.,Barney
05x02,Did one of your whores tell you that?,Robin
05x02,"And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.",Barney
05x02,Trouble? What trouble?,Lily
05x02,"It's, no, it's nothing.",Marshall
05x02,"Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.",Barney
05x02,"No, we're not.",Robin
05x02,"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",Marshall
05x02,"You kll me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not mrder me?!",Lily
05x02,"mrder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.",Marshall
05x02,Remember?,Ted
05x02,"Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.",Jen
05x02,You loved them.,Ted
05x02,"They're family, Ted.",Jen
05x02,"Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly can't think of anything I do wrong.",Ted
05x02,Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a 19 check,Robin
05x02,"Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.",Lily
05x02,"Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!",Marshall
05x02,Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.,Jen
05x02,Me?,Ted
05x02,Ted?,All the other
05x02,Yeah. We were all sitting over there...,Jen
05x02,"And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...",Jen
05x02,What about Cat Woman?,Lily
05x02,"Yeah, that would've been good.",Jen
05x02,Psst! Ted!,Barney
05x02,Nice.,Ted
05x02,"Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.",Ted
05x02,Nice.,Ted
05x02,We were checking out Moustache Marshall.,Ted
05x02,Ah...,The other
05x02,"Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.",Jen
05x02,"Yeah, well, it's nice to know past me wasn't a total jackass, huh?",Ted
05x02,"Present you isn't so bad, either.",Jen
05x02,Thank you very much.,Jen
05x02,You got it.,Ted
05x02,"Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.",Jen
05x02,"...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.",Ted
05x02,"Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.",Jen
05x02,"Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best",Ted
05x02,"Me, too.",Jen
05x02,That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?,Ted
05x02,I remember now.,Jen
05x02,Wow.,Jen
05x02,"Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?",Ted
05x02,"Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?",Jen
05x02,Absolutely.,Ted
05x02,Promise?,Jen
05x02,Promise.,Ted
05x02,I have been so busy.,Ted
05x02,"Good night, Ted.",Jen
05x02,Hello?,Jen
05x02,"Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.",Ted
05x02,"Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.",Jen
05x02,"Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, klling me off.",Lily
05x02,"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and sx. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.",Marhsall
05x02,"All right, we got to fix this.",Lily
05x02,"Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.",Lily
05x02,"Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.",Marshall
05x02,Bring out Stripper Lily!,Lily
05x02,"You know, I don't come here that much.",Barney
05x02,"Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching.",Waitress
05x02,"Thank you, kindly stranger.",Barney
05x02,"Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine.",Voice
05x02,"I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?",Lily
05x02,That was a hundred?,Marshall
05x02,"Wow, she crawls fast.",Lily
05x02,"Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.",Ted
05x02,"The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.",Jen
05x02,"No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what",Ted
05x02,She wants to pay the restaurant. He offers her his jacket. They takes pictures with Moustache Marshall. He calls her after their date. They marry.,Ted imagines
05x02,Wow.,Jen
05x02,Wow.,Marshall
05x02,You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.,Barney
05x02,"I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.",Robin
05x02,Just the best.,Barney
05x02,"Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.",Marshall
05x02,Just the best.,Barney
05x02,... now what?,Jen
05x02,I just remembered why I didn't call you.,Ted
05x02,Why?,Jen
05x02,"I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.",Ted
05x02,What?,Jen
05x02,And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.,Ted
05x02,Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.,Jen
05x02,"Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?",Ted
05x02,"Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.",Jen
05x02,"Well... good luck out there, Jen.",Ted
05x02,"You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.",Jen
05x02,"And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30 pity.",Ted 
05x02,"Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.",Marshall
05x02,"What did you say, buddy?",Lily
05x02,Lily?,Marshall
05x02,"Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?",Lily
05x02,Lily!,Marshall
05x03,"Kids, your uncle Barney had been called a lot of names over the years.",Ted 
05x03,Jerk!,Girl 1
05x03,bstrd!,Girl 2
05x03,Barack Obama Jr.?!,Girl 3
05x03,Mm-hmm. And yes... we can.,Barney
05x03,But there's one name none of us ever expected to hear him called.,Ted 
05x03,"Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say.",Robin
05x03,"Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.",Ted
05x03,"But other than that, things are good?",Lily
05x03,Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
05x03,I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long.,Robin
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"Like, the other night, I wake up at 4:00 a.m",Robin
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"Barney, are you awake? Barney?",Robin
05x03,Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed.,Robin
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,That's happened three times.,Robin
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"And it's not just that, it's other things.",Robin
05x03,Hey. What's wrong?,Barney
05x03,"I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...",Robin
05x03,"Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.",Barney
05x03,"Oh, thanks.",Robin
05x03,"And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have sx. Mm-kay?",Barney
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but... a little more effort would be nice.",Robin
05x03,Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
05x03,I understand.,Robin
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up.",Lily
05x03,Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends.",Lily
05x03,Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
05x03,"No, that's not it.",Robin
05x03,Bowl.,Ted
05x03,I don't know.,Robin
05x03,Bowl,Ted
05x03,Maybe he just doesn't have it in him.,Robin
05x03,Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
05x03,Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake.,Robin
05x03,Bowl?,Ted
05x03,She really said that?,Barney
05x03,"And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.",Ted
05x03,"Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--",Barney
05x03,Mm-hmm.,Ted
05x03,"I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!",Barney
05x03,"But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate, sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing.",Ted 
05x03,He's cheating on me.,Robin
05x03,What?!,Lily
05x03,Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.,Robin
05x03,"Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.",Lily
05x03,"Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.",Robin
05x03,"Well, that doesn't prove anything.",Lily
05x03,Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. .,Robin
05x03,And what do you plan on doing with it?,Lily
05x03,"We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.",Robin
05x03,"No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things: friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch.  Let go.",Lily
05x03,"Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.",Marshall
05x03,There's a basement storage area?,Robin
05x03,"Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found.",Marshall
05x03,"Oh, that's great, honey.",Lily
05x03,What the hell is that?,Robin
05x03,Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.,Lily
05x03,Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin,Marshall
05x03,Barrel resin?,Robin
05x03,Just go with it.,Lily
05x03,So you need a hand throwing it out?,Robin
05x03,"No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.",Marshall
05x03,"So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?",Robin
05x03,"I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?",Marshall
05x03,"Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.",Robin
05x03,"Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle.",Marshall
05x03,"The Bermuda Triangle was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny.",Ted 
05x03,This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.,Marshall
05x03,"Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.",Robin
05x03,"See you, sweetie. Good luck.",Lily
05x03,"Bye, babe.",Marshall
05x03,"Now, can we please get out of here?",Lily
05x03,Yeah. I'll grab my coat.,Robin
05x03,Oops.,Robin
05x03,A college notebook?!,Lily
05x03,"Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb. Birthday: July 23.Favorite hockey team: the Vancouver Canucks. Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26. Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me.",Robin
05x03,I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face!,Marshall
05x03,"She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight?",Marshall
05x03,"What do you know about this,Marshall?",Lily
05x03,Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?,Robin
05x03,Well...,Marshall
05x03,The truth was...Barney was taking a night school class taught... by me.,Ted 
05x03,Welcome to Robin 101.,Ted
05x03,Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.,Robin
05x03,...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!,Barney
05x03,"Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?",Barney
05x03,"Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.",Ted
05x03,Okay.,Barney
05x03,"And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.",Ted
05x03,"Hey, guys. What you talking about?",Robin
05x03,Fantasy football.,Barney
05x03,"They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So... Ted's classroom.",Marshall
05x03,"How To Date Robin Scherbatsky. Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down...",Ted
05x03,I'm bored.,Barney
05x03,You said you wanted my help.,Ted
05x03,Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?,Barney
05x03,We did that ready.,Ted
05x03,"No, like, really big boobs.",Barney
05x03,"No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.",Ted
05x03,Can we have class outside?,Barney
05x03,No! What Robin really wants deep down...,Ted
05x03,Barney!,Ted
05x03,What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- H's or no?,Barney
05x03,"Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?",Ted
05x03,They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?,Barney
05x03,"Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?",Ted
05x03,Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70 off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid.,Barney
05x03,Class number two.,Lily
05x03,Top Ten Robin Scherbatsky Facial Expressions and Their Meaning.,Robin
05x03,"Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean?",Ted
05x03,You guys just had sx? Oh! Wasn't me.,Barney
05x03,"Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...",Ted
05x03,Okay.,Barney
05x03,"This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter.  Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?",Ted
05x03,That's a building.,Barney
05x03,Oh...  That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...,Ted
05x03,Dude!,Barney
05x03,Right. The most important facial expression of all.,Ted
05x03,Whoa...,Barney
05x03,"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point: defusing the bmb.",Ted
05x03,Defusing the bmb? What does that even mean?,Robin
05x03,Three Topics To Distract Robin From Being Mad At You.,Lily
05x03,"Distract me? Oh, that is so condescending. These guys are really starting to piss me off!",Robin
05x03,"Immediately switch the conversation To one of the following, unless you want Robin to start throwing her shoes.",Lily
05x03,One. Vancouver Canucks 2004 Division Title.,Ted
05x03,"What?! That's not distracting. That's just talking about the story of a scrappy little underdog team that prevailed despite very shaky goal ending and, frankly, the declining skills of Trevor Linden.",Robin
05x03,Two: Proper gn Cleaning and Maintenance.,Ted
05x03,"You have to clean your gn. My uncle had a filthy old shotgun, blew both his thumbs off trying to sht a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob.",Robin
05x03,Three: Emperor Penguins.,Ted
05x03,"Did you know that before intercourse, the male and female emperor penguins bow to each other? Mr. Penguin  What were we talking about?",Robin
05x03,"Neither can you, sweetie.",Lily
05x03,"Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God!",Marshall
05x03,Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me.,Robin
05x03,I don't know. Check this out. This is actually kind of sweet.,Lily
05x03,"Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call touchy-feely. She doesn't say, I love you, like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, You're an idiot.",Ted
05x03,You're an idiot?,Barney
05x03,"Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say I love you, she's already broken up with you in her mind.",Ted
05x03,I think 's nice that Ted knows you that well.,Lily
05x03,"Ah, well, too bad it's next to a page entitled...",Robin
05x03,Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones. Right knee-- ticklish. Left knee...,Ted
05x03,Does lefty like that?,Ted
05x03,"Oh, yeah...lefty like that.",Ted
05x03,"I can't believe I'm taking sexual advice from Ted Mosby. That's like taking fashion advice from... well, Ted Mosby.",Barney
05x03,"Oh, here's a good one. Top Five Things Never to Do Around Robin.",Lily
05x03,"Three: Never, ever play the 'Guess Who' game with her.",Ted
05x03,What do you mean?,Barney
05x03,Guess who?,Ted
05x03,It's me! It's me! It's me!,Ted
05x03,"Number four: Unless you want to see it 80 times a day, for the next month, never show Robin a YouTube clip of an animal playing a musical instrument.",Ted
05x03,Barney! Do you have a problem with this class?,Ted
05x03,"Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.",Barney
05x03,"Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.",Ted
05x03,"Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor? .",Barney
05x03,"It may not have been a thumbs-up, kids.",Ted 
05x03,"Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz.",Ted
05x03,What...,Barney
05x03,"When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?",Ted
05x03,Trick question. Get her butterscotch.,Barney
05x03,Correct! Why?,Ted
05x03,Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.,Barney
05x03,Correct! What is Robin's dream job?,Ted
05x03,To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.,Barney
05x03,"Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?",Ted
05x03,"No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?",Barney
05x03,Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.,Ted
05x03,"Oh, Captain! My Captain!",Barney
05x03,How good was Dead Poet's Society?,Ted
05x03,"I know, right? The end? Tears.",Barney
05x03,"Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, I am proud of you, eh?",Robin
05x03,So why are you crying now?,Marshall
05x03,I'm not crying.,Robin
05x03,"Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?",Lily
05x03,"Oh, stop it.",Robin
05x03,Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.,Robin
05x03,So?,Lily
05x03,That's right now.,Robin
05x03,"Now, as you can see, well over 50 of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?",Ted
05x03,"Yeah, I have one.",Robin
05x03,"Yes, Robin?",Ted
05x03,"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh.",Ted
05x03,"I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?",Barney
05x03,What the hell do you two think you're doing?,Robin
05x03,"Marshall, did you sells out?",Barney
05x03,"I was vulnerable, I said good-bye to a very dear friend today.",Marshall
05x03,"Dude, it's a barrel!",Robin
05x03,Aw! You're giving Mabel away?,Ted
05x03,I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? .,Robin
05x03,"Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.",Ted
05x03,Auditing?,Robin
05x03,"Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.",Ted
05x03,"On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.",Barney
05x03,Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?,Robin
05x03,"They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning.",Shin-Ya
05x03,"You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?",Robin
05x03,Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!,Barney
05x03,: Kiss ass.,Lily
05x03,"You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.",Robin
05x03,"Uh, really? Name one wrong thing.",Ted
05x03,"Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.",Robin
05x03,Does lefty like that?,Ted
05x03,Oh. Yeah...,Robin
05x03,Don't wanna leave out the righty.,Ted
05x03,"Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.",Robin
05x03,Noted.,Ted
05x03,That was a lie?,Ted
05x03,We had just started dating. I was being nice.,Robin
05x03,"And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.",Robin
05x03,That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.,Barney
05x03,"You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.",Robin
05x03,What do you want?,Robin
05x03,Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.,Ted
05x03,I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.,Robin
05x03,"It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?",Ted
05x03,"Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?",Robin
05x03,"I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.",Ted
05x03,"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.  But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small",Barney
05x03,You're an idiot.,Robin
05x03,You know...,Robin
05x03,Hmm?,Barney
05x03,"That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.",Robin
05x03,And your work address.,Barney
05x03,Whoa.,Barney
05x03,"Hey, guys! If you don't want the barrel, can you sit somewhere else? You're scaring away potential takers.",Marsahll
05x03,"Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind...",Ted
05x03,"Uh, Professor Mosby?",Student
05x03,"Yes, Susan?",Ted
05x03,That's a woman drinking beer on the toilet.,Student
05x03,"Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on.",Ted
05x04,It was the Fall of 2009 and I was a professor now. So I decided to change my look a little bit. And people were noticing.,Ted 
05x04,"Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.",Barney
05x04,"You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.",Marshall
05x04,"Because the people who wear them are constantly going, Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?",Barney
05x04,You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.,Ted
05x04,"You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.",Robin
05x04,"So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.",Lily
05x04,"Uh, sure. Why not?",Robin
05x04,"For years, Marshall and Lily had been the only married couple in a group full",Ted 
05x04,Welcome.,Lily
05x04,Gouda?,Marshall
05x04,They sucked at it.,Ted 
05x04,"This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right?",Lily
05x04,"So, should we just go ahead and lock the four of us in for new year's?",Marshall
05x04,"Um, it's April.",Guy
05x04,Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving.,Marshall
05x04,Our parents really want to meet you!,Lily
05x04,"Well, we should probably be going.",Guy
05x04,"Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it.",Marshall
05x04,It's getting pretty late. We're going to go.,Woman
05x04,There's still pie.,Lily
05x04,Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again.,Marshall
05x04,"I'm sorry, Marshall, but Falguni and I are just not that into you. And you.",Man
05x04,"But just when Lily and Marshall were about to give up, two of their best friends in the world got together. And hope returned to their hearts.",Ted 
05x04,Wohoo!,Lily
05x04,So when Lily said...,Ted 
05x04,Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.,Lily
05x04,"Um, sure, why not?",Robin
05x04,Barney and Robin had no idea what they were about to walk into.,Ted 
05x04,Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room.  Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about nour trip to Cabo.,Lily
05x04,"Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded.",Marshall
05x04,"Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades.",Lily
05x04,"Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by...",Marshall
05x04,Sounds like?,Lily
05x04,"Okay, you can be Robin's partner.",Marshall
05x04,"Oh... Baby, we can do this.",Lily
05x04,Welcome.,Lily
05x04,Gouda?,Marshall
05x04,"Meanwhile, my half-baked theory that ladies dig the professor look was actually proving to be true.",Ted 
05x04,So is it hard to grade papers?,Girl
05x04,"No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a shot. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system.",Ted
05x04,Sometimes things just seem to magically fall into place.,Ted 
05x04,"So, you said you live right upstairs...",Girl
05x04,Whether it's in the dating world...,Ted 
05x04,Take care. Bye.,Lily
05x04,Or the double-dating world.,Ted 
05x04,Nailed it!,Lily
05x04,Best night ever!,Marshall
05x04,Worst night ever.,Barney
05x04,"Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?",Ted
05x04,Brutal.,Robin
05x04,Really? How?,Ted
05x04,"It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.",Barney
05x04,"And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.",Robin
05x04,Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?,Lily
05x04,"In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!",Marshall
05x04,And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.,Barney
05x04,"Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?",Ted
05x04,"Yeah, how'd you know?",Robin
05x04,"Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.",Ted
05x04,That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.,Lily
05x04,You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda.,Marshall
05x04,That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.,Lily
05x04,"Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda.",Marshall
05x04,And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.,Lily
05x04,Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.,Marshall
05x04,"Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.",Barney
05x04,"P.S., not sitting great.",Robin
05x04,"And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.",Barney
05x04,"What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?",Lily
05x04,"I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.",Marshall
05x04,"Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. : You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.",Lily
05x04,"Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.",Ted
05x04,Show him.,Robin
05x04,This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night.  It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.,Barney
05x04,"It was the best night ever laughter raining down like April showers oh, we talked for hours... best night ever...",Marshall 
05x04,"oh, that's not good.",Ted
05x04,"Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day.",Marshall 
05x04,"Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.",Barney
05x04,"I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?",Ted
05x04,"I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.",Barney
05x04,Oh.,Marshall
05x04,"Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.",Robin
05x04,"Let's do it again, soon.",Barney
05x04,"Yeah, we'll call you.",Robin
05x04,They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?,Ted
05x04,"Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.",Robin
05x04,"Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you.",Girl
05x04,Right?,Ted
05x04,Who was that?,Robin
05x04,"Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.",Ted
05x04,"Uh, no, it doesn't.",Barney
05x04,"Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.",Ted
05x04,"Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?",Barney
05x04,Westchester. Why?,Ted
05x04,You're the sexless innkeeper.,Barney
05x04,"Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!",Robin
05x04,What the hell is the sexless innkeeper?,Ted
05x04,"Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?",Barney
05x04,Not really.,Ted
05x04,"T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens.  The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...",Barney
05x04,"Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?",Ted
05x04,"Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, where do you live?And she said, one block south.. I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",Barney
05x04,"Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",Ted
05x04,"Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket",Barney
05x04,No way.,Ted
05x04,"I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.",Barney
05x04,"Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!",Robin
05x04,"Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.",Lily
05x04,We have. Go on.,Robin
05x04,Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!,Lily
05x04,"Wait, you guys were serious about that?",Robin
05x04,"Oh, we never joke about bb's, especially at the height of syrup season.",Marshall
05x04,"Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.",Lily
05x04,"And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.",Marshall
05x04,"Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.",Barney
05x04,"Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.",Lily
05x04,"Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.",Marshall
05x04,What's going on?,Lily
05x04,"Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.",Robin
05x04,"Plus, the alien thing.",Barney
05x04,"Come on,Marshall.",Lily
05x04,Let's go.,Marshall
05x04,No...Lily...,Robin
05x04,You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.,Marshall
05x04,I think they bought it.,Barney
05x04,I can't believe they broke up with us.,Marshall
05x04,We're so lovable.,Lily
05x04,"No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.",Marshall
05x04,I thought we did everything right.,Lily
05x04,I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.,Marshall
05x04,"Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.",Lily
05x04,"It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this...",Ted 
05x04,"ordered Chinese food today some moo shu pork sauce got away flipped the cushion, now everything's okay.",Marshall 
05x04,"Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together.",Marshall
05x04,"Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...",Marshall
05x04,I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.,Lily
05x04,"If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.",Marshall
05x04,"Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.",Lily
05x04,"One thing?  One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?",Marshall
05x04,"You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!",Lily
05x04,"Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.",Ted
05x04,"Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?",Barney
05x04,"Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.",Ted
05x04,"To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?",Barney
05x04,"Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.",Ted
05x04,You're right.,Robin
05x04,Thank you.,Ted
05x04,All that sexlessness has made you wise.,Robin
05x04,For god's sake!,Ted
05x04,"Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.",Barney
05x04,"But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.",Ted 
05x04,Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.,Robin
05x04,Oh. I wish you had called.,Lily
05x04,"I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!",Marshall
05x04,"Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda!",Guy
05x04,Oh!,Marshall
05x04,"Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.",Lily
05x04,Wait. We just want...,Robin
05x04,"Hey! Hey, guys.",Marshall
05x04,Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.,Barney
05x04,"Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.",Lily
05x04,"Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
05x04,"Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.",Robin
05x04,"Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.",Barney
05x04,Yeah.,Robin
05x04,"Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.",Lily
05x04,Who the hell are these people?,Barney
05x04,They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie,Lily
05x04,Mmm!,Marshall
05x04,"And Shea, well... She's...",Lily
05x04,Shea...Shea is just...,Marshall
05x04,"Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.",Lily
05x04,"Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.",Robin
05x04,"Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two.  Ooh.",Marshall
05x04,"Pfft, who needs 'em?",Robin
05x04,Pfft. Not us.,Barney
05x04,Hi. Two for dinner.,Robin
05x04,Just the two of you?,Woman
05x04,"Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.",Barney
05x04,"After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.",Robin
05x04,"Hey, guys.",Ted
05x04,"Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?",Ted
05x04,Maybe. But they're Armani.,Barney
05x04,"Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?",Ted
05x04,"Oh, yeah!",Marshall
05x04,"That was amazing, Lily!",Girl
05x04,"I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, what?!",Lily
05x04,You guys are the best.,Guy
05x04,"Oh, right back at you!",Marshall
05x04,Ding.,Barney
05x04,For charades.,Robin
05x04,How do we know you two won't hurt us again?,Lily
05x04,You don't.,Robin
05x04,You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.,Marshall
05x04,"Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?",Barney
05x04,Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?,Lily
05x04,I think we can change them.,Marshall
05x04,"Come here, you two.",Lily
05x04,We'll never sleep on thegouda again.,Barney
05x04,"Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?",Ted
05x04,"No, not really.",Barney
05x04,"'twas the night before, I had hours to kll.  I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.",Ted
05x04,With quill?,Barney
05x04,"Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said classy, but her eyes whispered sin. She said, you're a teacher? I said, yes, indeed. I must have you, she moaned.I'm turned on by tweed. With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.",Ted
05x04,No way. You made that up.,Barney
05x04,"Are you coming back bed, professor?",Girl
05x04,Whew!,Barney
05x04,"God, I love being single.",Ted
05x04,"Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?",Robin
05x04,What have I done?,Marshall
05x05,"Kids, as you know, Aunt Robin grew up in Canada. That meant sometimes she dressed agrave; little differently.",Ted 
05x05,"Okay, let's do this!",Robin
05x05,Sometimes she talked a little differently.,Ted 
05x05,"Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?",Robin
05x05,She hung out at different bars and enjoyed leisure time a little differently.,Ted 
05x05,You want to go? You want to go?! Come on!  Make fun of the Great White North all you want. It's the best country in the world.,fighting
05x05,"The... mmm. Social experiment.  U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A...",Barney
05x05,"Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in.  Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything.",Robin
05x05,Shrimp fried rice...,Barney
05x05,"Shrimp fried rice, shrimp fried rice...",All singing
05x05,"Shrimp fried rice totally. Anyway, speaking of food, Marshall, I've got so bad news. Just read online, Gazzola's is closing.","Ted, joining them"
05x05,No!,Marshall
05x05,What Gazzola's?,Robin
05x05,"A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.",Ted
05x05,"Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.",Marshall
05x05,"22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.",Ted
05x05,"Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.",Marshall
05x05,Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.,Ted
05x05,Drank nothing but Tantrum.,Marshall
05x05,"Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA.",Ted 
05x05,"Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.",Marshall
05x05,I was color blind for two weeks after that.,Ted
05x05,I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.,Marshall
05x05,"It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.",Ted
05x05,So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?,Marshall
05x05,"I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.",Ted
05x05,"I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already.  Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an I to a We.",Ted
05x05,What do you mean?,Barney
05x05,Think about it.,Ted
05x05,"Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?",Ted
05x05,We're doing great.,"Marshall, in bar with Lily"
05x05,Do you watch the Jets game?,Ted
05x05,We most certainly did.,Marshall
05x05,How'd things go at the doctor?,Ted
05x05,We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.,Marshall
05x05,Hmm.,Barney
05x05,You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing asault charges.,Robin
05x05,Come on!,Robin
05x05,"I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.",Robin
05x05,"Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!",Ted
05x05,"Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.",Robin
05x05,Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.,Barney
05x05,"Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.",Robin
05x05,"I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.",Barney
05x05,"Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.",Robin
05x05,A cit...,Barney
05x05,I'll think about it.,Robin
05x05,"No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...",Barney
05x05,"Okay, Barney.",Robin
05x05,Sorry. It's a rich area.,Barney
05x05,It is.,Robin
05x05,"But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.",Barney
05x05,How do you know the Canadian test is easy?,Robin
05x05,It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?,Barney
05x05,"Ted! Ted! Check it out! I got black coffee on the left, I got Tantrum on the right! Do you have a phone book?!","Marshall, entering with a hat with drink"
05x05,"Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?",Ted
05x05,Tantrum!,Marshall
05x05,Tantrum!,Ted
05x05,"All right, let's hit the road.",Lily
05x05,You invited Lily?,Ted
05x05,We most certainly did!,Marshall
05x05,"I don't know if you caught that, but he did the we thing.",Barney
05x05,"Yeah, I heard him.",Ted
05x05,Okay.,Barney
05x05,Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.,Lily
05x05,"All right, next stop: Chicago.",Ted
05x05,I have to pee.,Lily
05x05,Couldn't you have gone before we left?,Ted
05x05,I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.,Lily
05x05,"Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.",Marshall
05x05,It wasn't.,Ted 
05x05,"Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
05x05,"Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.",Ted
05x05,"Ooh, punch buggy yellow!","Lily, fighting Ted"
05x05,Ow!,Ted
05x05,"Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
05x05,Thank you!,Ted
05x05,"Great. Oh, hey, Ted...",Lily
05x05,You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.,Ted
05x05,"No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.",Lily
05x05,"Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.",Ted
05x05,"Goodbye, Sparky.",Marshall
05x05,It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.,Lily
05x05,"Goodbye Sparky, by Nick Leotti. Read to you by Kenny Rogers.",Voice
05x05,Oh!,Marshall
05x05,"Chapter one: When I first saw Sparky, he reminded me of my favorite comb; he was missing a lot of teeth, but I loved him anyway. Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business.",Kenny
05x05,"That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
05x05,How many stars are on the flag?,Barney
05x05,"50, one for each state.",Robin
05x05,What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?,Barney
05x05,"The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.",Robin
05x05,"Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: Who is this?",Barney
05x05,Queen Elizabeth II.,Robin
05x05,"No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: What the hell is this?",Barney
05x05,"Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...",Robin
05x05,"Wrong. The answer we were looking for was I don't care, it's dumb. Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.",Barney
05x05,"...because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit- which isn't actually a ball, but's round like a ball- a football- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball- Indian rubber ball...",Kenny
05x05,This ends disk seven. The audio book continues on disk eight.  Disk eight.,Voice
05x05,"Lacrosse ball, volleyball...",Kenny
05x05,"Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!",Ted
05x05,"Ah, I do.",Lily
05x05,"It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse.",Ted 
05x05,"Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.",Marshall
05x05,Hotel?,Ted
05x05,"Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed and Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since.",Woman
05x05,"Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?",Marshall
05x05,"Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?",Woman
05x05,"And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.",Ted 
05x05,I want to say- Jefferson?,Robin
05x05,Correct.,Barney
05x05,Oh!,Robin
05x05,Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.,Barney
05x05,"Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!",Robin
05x05,"All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?",Barney
05x05,"That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the Hey, Vern guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.",Robin
05x05,"Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?",Barney
05x05,"Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.",Robin
05x05,"Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your gns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",Barney
05x05,Look who's back from the wishing well.,Woman
05x05,"It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",Ted
05x05,"Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",Marshall
05x05,"Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",Lily
05x05,"All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?",Woman
05x05,And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.,Ted 
05x05,We'd love cornmeal body scrub!,Marshall and Lily
05x05,Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,Ted
05x05,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all.  O Canada Our home and native land... Oh, God, I miss it. True patriots love...",Robin
05x05,"Hey, man.",Ted
05x05,Shh.,Marshall
05x05,Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,Ted
05x05,Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,Marshall
05x05,"Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",Marshall
05x05,Chicago.,Ted
05x05,"What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",Marshall
05x05,She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,Ted
05x05,I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,Marshall
05x05,And I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more...,"Marshall and Ted, singing"
05x05,"Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",Ted
05x05,"If she's pissed, she's pissed.",Marshall
05x05,Pfft.,Ted
05x05,"When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.",Ted 
05x05,Good morning.,Barney
05x05,"Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?",Robin
05x05,You went Canadian.,Barney
05x05,How Canadian?,Robin
05x05,This Canadian.  Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,Barney
05x05,"Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",Robin
05x05,"We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams Rich title double bill in Toronto.",Robin
05x05,"How did you find me, anyway?",Robin
05x05,"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",Barney
05x05,Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,Robin
05x05,"You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",Barney
05x05,"Barney, I'm not taking the test.",Robin
05x05,"God, you're still drunk.",Barney
05x05,"Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.",Robin
05x05,"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",Barney
05x05,Kind of cross.,Ted
05x05,You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,Marshall
05x05,Just like old times!,Ted
05x05,I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,Marshall
05x05,But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,Ted
05x05,It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.,Man
05x05,Cornmeal...,Marshall
05x05,We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,Lily
05x05,I can't believe you guys are closing.,Ted
05x05,I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.,Man
05x05,It's like an entire country without a tailor.,Barney
05x05,"Yeah, give me two coffees.",Robin
05x05,"3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?",Women
05x05,What game?,Robin
05x05,The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.,Women
05x05,"Oh, I guess I missed it.",Robin
05x05,"Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change.",Women
05x05,I'm not American.,Robin
05x05,American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No please or thank you for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.,Women
05x05,What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,Barney
05x05,"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",Robin
05x05,And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,Barney
05x05,I don't want this anymore.,Marshall
05x05,"Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",Ted
05x05,We shouldn't have left Lily.,Marshall
05x05,"Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",Ted
05x05,"I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!",Marshall
05x05,What exactly is Ted's fault?,Ted
05x05,"This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",Marshall
05x05,"We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",Ted
05x05,That is not true.,Marshall
05x05,"It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",Ted
05x05,"Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",Marshall
05x05,"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",Barney
05x05,"When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",Robin
05x05,"Okay, that's it.  Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a tie.",Barney
05x05,"Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.",Kenny
05x05,"I'm sorry, ted!",Marshall
05x05,"I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",Ted
05x05,"No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?",Marshall
05x05,"Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",Ted
05x05,"Hells, yeah!",Marshall
05x05,Or listen to the Sparky book again?,Ted
05x05,Listen to the Sparky book again.,Marshall
05x05,Okay. Let's listen to it again.,Ted
05x05,"Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",Barney
05x05,"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, Yeah, America's cool.",Robin
05x05,Hmm.,Barney
05x05,"And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too. I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",Robin
05x05,"Wait, you can do that?",Barney
05x05,"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",Robin
05x05,I see.,Barney
05x05,You understand?,Robin
05x05,"No, I can see out of my left eye again.",Barney
05x05,"Hey, baby? Baby?",Marshall
05x05,Hmm? Yeah?,Lily
05x05,I'm so sorry that we left you.,Marshall
05x05,"Did you go somewhere, sweetie?",Lily
05x05,"Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.",Ted 
05x05,"Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...",Lily
05x05,"So, I had a great time, too.",Lily
05x05,That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.,Marshall
05x05,"Oh, that's okay.",Lily
05x05,"And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.",Ted 
05x05,"God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!",Marshall
05x05,It's like a hot ball of lead!,Ted
05x05,"Baby, cut it out of me.",Marshall
05x05,"That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?",Marshall
05x05,I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?,Ted
05x05,"You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?",Marshall
05x05,Tantrum! I have to pee.,"Lily, on the roof of the car"
05x06,"In autumn 2009, a new couple moved just above.We had not met but you could hear all the time. They kept... children, say they did not stop playing the bagpipes.",Ted 
05x06,This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.,Robin
05x06,I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.,Ted
05x06,"It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park.",Robin
05x06,Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!,Ted
05x06,I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.,Ted 
05x06,I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.,Barney
05x06,Not at all.,Ted
05x06,Look what I saw yesterday.,Barney
05x06,"Baby, you can wash it?",Lily
05x06,No problem.,Marshall
05x06,I gotta go.,Barney
05x06,"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.",Barney
05x06,There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.,Ted
05x06,They have a big problem.,Barney
05x06,"I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... little known because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.",Ted
05x06,"If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.",Barney
05x06,And a half?,Ted
05x06,An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.,Barney
05x06,What's new?,Marshall
05x06,Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.,Barney
05x06,"According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.",Ted
05x06,"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?",Marshall
05x06,I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.,Barney
05x06,"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a kller foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.",Marshall
05x06,Let me ask you a question.,Barney
05x06,Go ahead.,Marshall
05x06,"Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?",Barney
05x06,Not really.,Marshall
05x06,"So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.",Barney
05x06,"But if I said that, we will play, so...",Marshall
05x06,"You argue. Robin, we do not fight.",Barney
05x06,Of course I do.,Ted
05x06,"No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...",Barney
05x06,Why is there a bag of pants marked April 2008 in your closet?,Robin
05x06,So when you think you will play and you get up you go?,Ted
05x06,It works in 100 of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.,Barney
05x06,This is not true.,Ted
05x06,I can not believe Robin supports it.,Marshall
05x06,Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.,Barney
05x06,The ties go to the machine?,Robin
05x06,You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.,Marshall
05x06,"Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.",Ted
05x06,Call me crazy.,Marshall
05x06,Mad.,Ted
05x06,"But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.",Marshall
05x06,"There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.",Barney
05x06,"Barney, you came home!",Lily
05x06,Go to the basics!,Marshall
05x06,Okay.,Barney
05x06,"Thank you, doll.",Barney
05x06,"Honey, you're going to wash it?",Lily
05x06,"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel is what you will paint the?",Barney
05x06,No. Of course not.,Lily
05x06,"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.",Barney
05x06,Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.,Lily
05x06,It's because you're a woman.,Barney
05x06,I do not even know why we laugh!,Lily
05x06,Of course not.,Barney
05x06,Are you kidding me.,Ted
05x06,"Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.",Marshall
05x06,"Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy atillery.",Barney
05x06,"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.",Barney
05x06,You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.,Lily
05x06,"Now, turn around.",Barney
05x06,You beat him or I do it?,Ted
05x06,He's right.,Marshall
05x06,"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.",Ted
05x06,The piercing was cool.,Barney
05x06,"It was cool, huh?",Marshall
05x06,Stay with me! Barney is wrong.,Ted
05x06,"No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.",Marshall
05x06,You just said the opposite!,Ted
05x06,I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!,Marshall
05x06,You're welcome.,Barney
05x06,Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.,Ted
05x06,I think that's true.,Robin
05x06,I told you.,Barney
05x06,Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.,Ted
05x06,"You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.",Robin
05x06,"Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.",Ted
05x06,Thank you.,Robin
05x06,"Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!",Barney
05x06,Have fun.,Ted
05x06,"Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work.",Marshall
05x06,I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.,Ted
05x06,Will it work.,Marshall
05x06,A second time. This is a bad idea.,Ted
05x06,"Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.",Marshall
05x06,No. She will be angry and you will play.,Ted
05x06,It is a slap bet?,Marshall
05x06,We bet a slap.,Ted
05x06,"Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
05x06,"Lily, I am delighted that you mention.",Marshall
05x06,I can stay here tonight?,Marshall
05x06,"I am preparing the couch, man.",Ted
05x06,The ski babes are back!,Robin
05x06,How was the trip?,Ted
05x06,Okay.,Barney
05x06,"We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags.",Robin
05x06,What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?,Ted
05x06,"It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?",Barney
05x06,We all came out a year.,Ted
05x06,"short, and your weekend?",Barney
05x06,Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!,Marshall
05x06,"Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
05x06,"Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies.  You see? It's just...",Marshall
05x06,"I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?",Marshall
05x06,What happened to the I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love?,Barney
05x06,I should have noted.,Marshall
05x06,I'm making more money than you.,Marshall
05x06,Excuse me?,Lily
05x06,Dance for me.,Marshall
05x06,"It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply.",Marshall
05x06,It started with the dishes but after...,Marshall
05x06,So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.,Lily
05x06,"It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest.",Marshall
05x06,I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.,Lily
05x06,You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.,Marshall
05x06,"If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit.",Lily
05x06,My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.,Marshall
05x06,"Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance.",Lily
05x06,"Do not do that, please.",Marshall
05x06,"Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.",Marshall
05x06,"You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.",Barney
05x06,He's right.,Marshall
05x06,Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.,Ted
05x06,This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...,Marshall
05x06,What do you eat?,Barney
05x06,"Well shit, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!",Marshall
05x06,"Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.",Robin
05x06,"Hey, Ro-Ro.",Barney
05x06,You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?,Ted
05x06,Nothing. We're just happy.,Robin
05x06,"As Gandhi said, A smile costs nothing, baby.",Barney
05x06,I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.,Ted
05x06,So you talked to the neighbors?,Robin
05x06,"Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.",Ted
05x06,Some old?,Robin
05x06,Really old.,Ted
05x06,So you did what?,Robin
05x06,"I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left.",Ted
05x06,"I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.",Marshall
05x06,"Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.",Lily
05x06,I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.,Marshall
05x06,You will perhaps have to do it again.,Lily
05x06,And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick.,Ted 
05x06,"I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.",Marshall
05x06,It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.,Ted
05x06,"Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.",Marshall
05x06,"You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.",Ted
05x06,"Thank you, Robbie Engineering.",Ted
05x06,I do not like nicknames.,Robin
05x06,"You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?",Ted
05x06,"Seriously, stop.",Robin
05x06,It's T-Mose.,Ted
05x06,I do not like with you either.,Robin
05x06,"Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.",Marshall
05x06,T-Mose was great. I think of the show.,Ted
05x06,The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.,Marshall
05x06,They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.,Ted
05x06,"And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.",Ted 
05x06,How will Marshall and Lily?,Barney
05x06,"Those two worry me, really.",Robin
05x06,"You and your big, huge heart.",Barney
05x06,Enough. The game is over.,Ted
05x06,What do you mean by that?,Barney
05x06,"Who, him?",Robin
05x06,"It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too surnomants. It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.",Ted
05x06,How would you know that?,Robin
05x06,Phil told me.,Ted
05x06,Who the hell is Phil?,Barney
05x06,Your downstairs neighbor.,Ted
05x06,I'm Phil. 12-B.,Man
05x06,And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?,Ted
05x06,All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,Barney
05x06,I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.,Barney
05x06,It's your board that is zero.,Robin
05x06,You're on the side of Lily? You...  No. We will argue and I can not spin.,Barney
05x06,I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.,Robin
05x06,Or so I tried the jump?,Barney
05x06,Or just the pants?,Robin
05x06,This trick of dodging is over?,Barney
05x06,I think.,Robin
05x06,You have the? This is the smallest!,Barney
05x06,They fight because of you!?,Robin
05x06,And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.,Barney
05x06,All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.,Robin
05x06,The tie mrderd by Robin.,Barney
05x06,The hidden camera in the headboard.,Robin
05x06,"As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.",Barney
05x06,Barney for the millionth time...,Robin
05x06,I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!,Ted
05x06,"Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.",Barney
05x06,It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.,Robin
05x06,I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.,Ted
05x06,Stop it.,Robin
05x06,"Marshall, dinner is ready.",Lily
05x06,You've done for me?,Marshall
05x06,"No, but what is your favorite.",Lily
05x06,We need advice.,Barney
05x06,"Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland.",Ted 
05x06,"And in the end, Lily and Marshall had the same reaction.",Ted 
05x06,I'll do the dishes directly to my death.,Marshall
05x06,"I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak.",Lily
05x06,"Sure, honey.",Marshall
05x06,I love you.,Lily
05x06,I love you too.,Marshall
05x06,"You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?",Robin
05x06,I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.,Marshall
05x06,And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.,Lily
05x06,More important than winning.,Barney
05x06,"Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?",Robin
05x06,"The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part.",Lily
05x06,Good night.,Robin
05x06,What about now?,Barney
05x06,I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.,Robin
05x06,"Or, there is a bench in the elevator.",Barney
05x06,"That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?",Robin
05x06,Grave. It's not a competition.,Barney
05x06,We won!,Lily
05x06,Best couple of the world!,Marshall
05x06,Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.,Marshall
05x06,You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.,Lily
05x06,"And once the first fight set, all the others, well, they are also regulated.",Ted 
05x07,"Children, since I know your Uncle Barney, he has always had strong views on relationships.",Ted 
05x07,"Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted.",Barney
05x07,"And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend.",Ted 
05x07,Come on. Open it. It's prn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.,Barney
05x07,It's your prn collection.,Ted
05x07,"This is my collection of prn! I offer you my prn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more.",Barney
05x07,"Voluntarily, you abandon your prn...? You're really serious.",Lily
05x07,This is obvious.,Marshall
05x07,What does that mean?,Barney
05x07,"Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.",Marshall
05x07,What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.,Barney
05x07,"It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there.",Marshall
05x07,He really is growing at a time.,Lily
05x07,"We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.",Barney
05x07,He speaks to prn.,Robin
05x07,"Hi, Robin. A more.",Ted
05x07,Hi.,Robin
05x07,"My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty?",Lily
05x07,"You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises.",Marshall
05x07,You can get rid of it.,Lily
05x07,"No, it's not a problem. I'll do it.",Ted
05x07,Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash.,Lily
05x07,I read six of the words you just said about this jacket.,Marshall
05x07,"Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it.",Ted
05x07,Because...,Lily
05x07,"Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Barney who abandons his prn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Barney Stinson as we know it.",Ted
05x07,So what? They are happy.,Marshall
05x07,Let's go. A more.,Lily
05x07,So you're what?,Marshall
05x07,I Tail-Dalle.,Lily
05x07,What...? I thought I had seen in one take.,Marshall
05x07,Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle.,Lily
05x07,ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write Buckminster Fuller.,Ted
05x07,"Children, Prngrphy is wrong, and when I got rid of that horrible Prngrphy on the field...",Ted 
05x07,I get rid of this horrible Prngrphy on the field.,Ted
05x07,There is something terrible happened.,Ted 
05x07,ArchiSexture.,Voice
05x07,"If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my prn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!",Barney
05x07,"I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy.  Do not worry. The green light means it is off.",Barney
05x07,We're sure he had done?,Lily
05x07,"There is no reason to take it seriously, though?",Ted
05x07,"No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin.",Lily
05x07,But over time I began to notice things. Barney and Robin have stopped their crazy adventures.,Ted 
05x07,So what you did last night?,Lily
05x07,"I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.",Robin
05x07,It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.,Barney
05x07,Barney stopped being himself.,Ted 
05x07,"I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.",Ted
05x07,"Sorry, I have my own way tonight.",Barney
05x07,And Robin was annoyed when he opened his mouth.,Ted 
05x07,How do you go?,Lily
05x07,Super. Relations are deadly...,Barney
05x07,Shut up...,Robin
05x07,Exchanges and compromise...,Barney
05x07,Shut up...,Robin
05x07,Monogamy is the best.,Barney
05x07,Shut up.,Robin
05x07,Tagline!,Barney
05x07,Shut up.,Robin
05x07,But it got worse... more,Ted 
05x07,More hungry...,Barney
05x07,"The more they said everything was fine. In truth, Barney and Robin had just let go. But after a few weeks for us, they looked like that.",Ted 
05x07,I can... in a minute.,Barney
05x07,They kll.,Ted
05x07,They love each other.,Lily
05x07,"Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old.",Ted
05x07,My favorite cop show.,Marshall
05x07,This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.,Ted
05x07,They are perfect together.,Lily
05x07,It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.,Ted
05x07,We are two dominant sets.,Marshall
05x07,"Of course, my heart.",Lily
05x07,"If they are not happy, why not break?",Marshall
05x07,They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.,Ted
05x07,I think the first who plays Barney deflates.,Marshall
05x07,It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say selfish nicely?,Lily
05x07,Independents. Every relationship goes through there.,Lily
05x07,"It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle...",Marshall
05x07,Talk about Space Orgy?,Ted
05x07,Yeah.,Marshall
05x07,It's a bad time. Let us do things.,Lily
05x07,She's right.,Marshall
05x07,"Two against one, Ted. Let them.",Lily
05x07,I left them alone. But this weekend there...,Ted 
05x07,"Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?",Barney
05x07,"I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?",Marshall
05x07,Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!,Barney
05x07,So you're happy?,Marshall
05x07,"Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, Every moment is a battle.",Barney
05x07,So you're happy?,Marshall
05x07,And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.,Barney
05x07,"Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.",Barney
05x07,Okay. Decides that the piece.,Robin
05x07,What was the pizza again?,Barney
05x07,Face.,Robin
05x07,It's face.,Barney
05x07,"sx... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?",Barney
05x07,We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.,Marshall
05x07,What next?,Ted
05x07,We will release... the Kraken.,Marshall
05x07,"Children, as you know, earlier this year I learned that Lily had broken no one, not two, but seven of my past relationships.",Ted 
05x07,Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.,Lily
05x07,But you're the best.,Marshall
05x07,"I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker.",Lily
05x07,Find me someone.,Ted
05x07,I just started.,Lily
05x07,Please. You've got to break. This relationship is klling them.,Marshall
05x07,"I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things.",Lily
05x07,It's two against one.,Ted
05x07,But the one that's me.,Lily
05x07,No need for it. We can do it alone.,Ted
05x07,How?,Marshall
05x07,"When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball?",Ted
05x07,You do not have the right to do this to me.,Robin
05x07,What are you talking?,Ted
05x07,From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?,Robin
05x07,"If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.",Ted
05x07,"That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl?  Okay, going to the ring.",Marshall
05x07,A surveillance van.,Marshall
05x07,What?,Ted
05x07,"It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, That's not why I signed, or stuff like that.",Marshall
05x07,The server arrives.,Ted
05x07,"Please, shut up.",Robin
05x07,What?,Barney
05x07,"I thought you had mentioned, sorry.  This is an engagement ring?Are you...?",Robin
05x07,"No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?",Barney
05x07,We're committed to one another.,Robin
05x07,Your business is already in my apartment.,Barney
05x07,Easier for taxes.,Robin
05x07,And for your naturalization.,Barney
05x07,Scherbatsky is hard to spell.,Robin
05x07,My mother would be so happy.,Barney
05x07,"Yeah, I guess.",Robin
05x07,No reason not to do so.,Barney
05x07,We get married!,Barney
05x07,"Not so loud, shit.",Robin
05x07,What did you do? I'm furious now. It will not?,Lily
05x07,You will be my bridesmaid?,Robin
05x07,"Oh, my God! I'd love to!",Lily
05x07,"You have lost your mind? You knew they were playing that first deflates, and what? You give them an engagement ring!Okay, that's good. I care. I return to the center stage for a final rupture.",Lily
05x07,What next?,Marshall
05x07,"They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends.",Lily
05x07,You do not know any that girl over there?,Robin
05x07,"No, I do not think.  No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?",Barney

05x07,It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper.,Barney
05x07,He wears a diaper.,Robin
05x07,"No, it's protective armor.",Barney
05x07,A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.,Robin
05x07,Come on.,Barney
05x07,It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.,Robin
05x07,"You know, I'm sick.",Barney
05x07,I said nothing.,Robin
05x07,"The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper...",Barney
05x07,"And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American wr.",Lily
05x07,"thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?",Barney
05x07,You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.,Robin
05x07,"She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?",Barney
05x07,Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.,Robin
05x07,I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord...,Barney
05x07,I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights.,Ted
05x07,"Poor kid. This is how it will happen. They are the restau...  First, it rekindles debate US-Canada, when Alan Thicke, a native of Ontario, going to their table.",Lily
05x07,Alan Thicke?,Ted
05x07,Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang.,Marshall
05x07,"They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs.  So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA   Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes.",Lily

05x07,Of course they are robots! Must kll Luke Skywalker,Lily
05x07,No one said this in Star Wars.,Ted
05x07,Very bad robot voice.,Marshall

05x07,Why this big and this old will not stop us... It's us!,Barney
05x07,Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?,Robin

05x07,You then.,Robin
05x08,"Children, go out with someone for this is simple. We must be confident, good about yourself, and course of who you are. Uncle Barney was very good on this last point, although many times it was someone else.",Ted

05x09,I'm running in a meadow.,Barney
05x09,I can not do it. Why I can not do it?,Lily

05x12,"Guys, what's up?",Marshall
05x12,A new super sexy barmaid.,Lily
05x12,You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.,Robin
05x12,If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good.,Lily
05x12,"I know, and if this woman was almost as sexy as mine, so I admit, but it is not the case.",Marshall

05x12,That night I went to a very important first date.,Ted 
05x12,How are you?,Ted
05x12,Okay. Between.,Student
05x12,"It's funny, sometimes you walk into an apartment for the first time, but it was the feeling of being right where it should be. And children, it was the first time I saw the little yellow bus of your mother. You know him. It is right behind you.",Ted 
05x12,It's cute.,Ted
05x12,"Actually, this is my roommate.",Student
05x12,"And so I was there in the apartment of your mother, except that I was dating her roommate, Cindy.",Ted 
05x12,"Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like?",Ted
05x12,"I do not know, but I would hear the first description of the woman I would marry.",Ted 
05x12,That is a whore. I think this is a dominatrix.,Cindy
05x12,What?,Ted
05x12,"Okay, sorry, this is not true. I have a roommate complex.",Cindy
05x12,Why?,Ted
05x12,The guys always fall in love with her.,Cindy
05x12,"Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate.",Ted

05x12,The second sexiest.,Robin

05x12,"Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.",Marshall
05x12,No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?,Barney
05x12,Yes... You will not like the answer.,Marshall
05x12,My last three were former Wall Street brokers.Bastards. I swore never to go out with a guy who wears suits.,Barmaid
05x12,It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.,Barney
05x12,"Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume.",Robin
05x12,"True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait...",Barney
05x12,We know you're gonna say costumes.,Robin
05x12,"Meanwhile, Cindy and I spent a pleasant evening, but she was not kidding about his roommate complex.",Ted 
05x12,Another weird thing on my roommate: she paints robots who play sports.,Cindy
05x12,It's strange.,Ted
05x12,I lied. It looked great. The watercolor of the robot playing volleyball with your mother is still in remission.,Ted 
05x12,And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf.,Cindy
05x12,It's weird.,Ted
05x12,"The version of Memories of your mother, sung by an English muffin, is to date the most beautiful thing I've heard in my life.",Ted 
05x12,"Look, I am defeated. I hate it.",Ted
05x12,Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous.,Cindy
05x12,I do not know why. You're great.,Ted
05x12,"But not as much as your mother. And speaking of things that are less brilliant, your uncle Barney was formally arrested costumes.",Ted 
05x12,"Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply.",Barmaid
05x12,The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them.,Barney
05x12,"So, your date with Cindy?",Robin
05x12,"Well, last night, it was nice today, less.",Ted
05x12,Why?,Lily
05x12,I discovered that the settlement on all outgoing students and teachers are very strict. I could lose my scholarship.,Cindy
05x12,It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department.,Ted
05x12,"Sorry, but I can not take that risk.",Cindy
05x12,"She exaggerates, there, right?",Ted
05x12,"Well, Ted, she's right.",Robin
05x12,"And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in.",Lily
05x12,"I think you should leave it, buddy.",Marshall
05x12,"Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?",Ted
05x12,"Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy.",Ted 
05x12,In costume.,Barney
05x12,"None of us had seen for so long without Barney costume, and children, it was not pretty.",Ted 
05x12,Sorry for my delay. I was stuck at work. I had this presentation on taxes on dividends.,Marshall

05x12,In costume.,Barney
05x12,We will order food.,Marshall
05x12,I arrive in a second.,Barney
05x12,Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time.,Barney
05x12,"If someone could fix such a thing, it was the tailor personnel Barney, TV's Tim Gunn.",Ted 
05x12,"Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do.",Tim
05x12,So young. You can not do anything else?,Barney
05x12,No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.,Tim
05x12,It can... As an organ donor?,Barney
05x12,The death of this suit could save the life of another.,Tim
05x12,But I... Do it.,Barney
05x12,You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.,Tim
05x12,Sorry. I know. I know.,Barney
05x12,We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.,Barney
05x12,"Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.",Robin
05x12,"No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine.",Barney
05x12,There is absolutely right.,Ted
05x12,"Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?",Lily
05x12,"What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either!  I do not know why I did that.",Ted
05x12,"Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.",Barmaid
05x12,"It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no.",Barney
05x12,How old was he?,Barmaid
05x12,7 years. I miss him so much!,Barney
05x12,You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.,Barmaid
05x12,"Thank you, old friend. You go on a good shot.",Barney
05x12,"Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me.",Lily
05x12,I can not. You're sexier than she.,Marshall
05x12,"That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once.",Lily
05x12,"What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?",Marshall
05x12,I never said that.,Lily
05x12,You think so!,Marshall
05x12,It's not comparable. She is younger than you.,Lily
05x12,"I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.",Marshall
05x12,"You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.",Robin
05x12,I guess you also think she is sexier than me.,Marshall
05x12,What are you doing?,Carl
05x12,What?,Robin
05x12,You do not have the right to be there.,Carl
05x12,"Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.",Robin

05x12,"I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.",Robin
05x12,Can we talk?,Ted
05x12,My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.,Cindy
05x12,"I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says Do not teach in having drunk and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.",Ted
05x12,"I do not want it, me either.",Cindy
05x12,"I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.",Ted
05x12,Really?,Cindy
05x12,The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.,Ted
05x12,This is my roommate. I borrowed.,Cindy
05x12,And that? After World T.C Boyle?,Ted
05x12,Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.,Cindy
05x12,"You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.",Ted
05x12,It is in a group.,Cindy
05x12,"Damn, that's cool.",Ted
05x12,It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.,Cindy
05x12,The group played shows your roommate or...?,Ted
05x12,Get out.,Cindy
05x12,"Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella.",Ted 
05x12,"It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting.",Barney
05x12,I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.,Barmaid
05x12,"Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...",Barney
05x12,They are yours?,Barmaid
05x12,I'm the suit-sitting for someone.,Barney
05x12,"Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.",Barmaid
05x12,"I know what you're thinking, What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black!  spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis.",Barney
05x12,"Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?","Marshall, doing the same"
05x12,Costumes!,Barney
05x12,"What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?",Marshall
05x12,Costumes!,Barney
05x12,What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?,Robin
05x12,Do we see.,Barney
05x12,And a world at peace would be within your reach?,Lily
05x12,"I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dpote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume...",Barney
05x12,Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!,"Ted, Marshall, Lily"
05x12,"Mind you, it is rather barrel.  I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes.",Barney
05x12,Really?,Barmaid
05x12,Yeah.  I will do you nothing!,Barney
05x13,"Children, when you're 30 and live in New York, there are few places where it is better not to be. Time Square at New Year, Christmas at Rockefeller Center, but the worst: a student bar!",Ted 
05x13,"You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector.",Ted
05x13,"Ted, I'm champion of skee-ball, since law school. I have come here at least once a month to keep my record.",Marshall
05x13,"Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called Big caramel you're passed.",Ted
05x13,"Yes, yes.",Marshall
05x13,And you're Big caramel.,Ted
05x13,"The biggest. In fact, I must tell you something. I invited Jenkins.",Marshall
05x13,We have heard of Jenkins few weeks ago.,Ted 
05x13,You will not believe what Jenkins has done this time.,Marshall
05x13,Who is Jenkins?,Ted
05x13,"This is a new lawyer in the office of Marshall, he is hilarious.",Lily
05x13,"Hilarious! There was a jar of cherries in the fridge, then Jenkins said:  200 and I eat the whole pot. So we gave him  200, and he ate the whole jar!",Marshall
05x13,And the stories continued.,Ted 
05x13,"The CFO comes to sign papers, then Jenkins said: Excuse me Mr Wilkocs, I think we forgot one of the documents.We all went to a bar after work, Jenkins goes on the table and begins to gesticulate like a stripper, and a second later, he removes his shirt. It was so disgusting.",Marshall
05x13,"Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories.",Ted
05x13,And there's going to have another. I'll sleep with Jenkins.,Barney
05x13,What?!,Ted
05x13,You heard me.,Barney
05x13,You want to sleep with Jenkins?,Ted
05x13,"With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock.",Barney
05x13,But you are... really... I did not know that...,Ted
05x13,"Hi, guys.",Woman
05x13,Ted Jenkins here.,Marshall
05x13,"It's going to seem crazy, but I thought Jenkins was a guy.",Ted
05x13,What!? Where did you get it?,Marshall
05x13,"I do not know, maybe history: Jenkins pissed out the window of a taxi.",Ted
05x13,"Yes, even more impressive now, right?",Marshall
05x13,Yes.,Ted
05x13,"Ok, I confess! It all started a few weeks.",Marshall
05x13,"In fact the myopic! New lawyer, Jenkins here. Watch out for this guy, he steals things.",Man
05x13,I do not steal. And I do not wear glasses. Marshall.,Marshall
05x13,"Hi Marshall. So you're really a fan of the Vikings, or he lied about that too?",Jenkins
05x13,"Why? It's a trap, you're a fan of the Packers? My wife knows I'm here. She has no money, however it has very special skills.",Marshall
05x13,I'm a fan of the Vikings too! I think purple and gold. I am from Pelican Rapids.,Jenkins
05x13,"Pelican Rapids? My grandfather lives there. Finally he's dead now, but it haunts a bar on a road.",Marshall
05x13,"Wait, if you tell me that you flirt with a woman other than yours, I'll pull out and hit you.",Ted
05x13,"First, you can not control the Grand caramel. Secondly, I see it as a big brother, who has breasts. My older brother had also, in short.",Marshall
05x13,"That night, I spoke to Lily.",Marshall
05x13,I'm in a hurry to meet him.,Lily
05x13,"I should correct, it would have been so simple.",Marshall
05x13,"But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns.",Marshall
05x13,"So the manager comes to marketing staff to choose Midwest. So he, he, he, she, him, him, Jenkins, him, her.",Marshall
05x13,"Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too.",Ted
05x13,"Ted, think of the stories I've told.",Marshall
05x13,"Yes, it could be a problem.",Ted
05x13,"Exactly, that's why Lily can know nothing.",Marshall
05x13,Lily can know nothing of what?,Robin
05x13,What Marshall is going to buy a horse.,Ted
05x13,"Really?! It's great, I love this stuff. Guys why this kid staring at me? I understand, I think it happens at last. I recognized my show.",Robin
05x13,"That's so cute. But it's Scotty, one of my students, and he looks at me me. Weird that I'm more famous than you.",Ted
05x13,"No, I go on TV.",Robin
05x13,"And I have 30 students in my class, which means, go, 30 times your hearing. We're going to buy Scotty a drink for old teacher. Scotty then, a question on neoclassical architecture, and it's good.",Ted
05x13,"You are Robin Scherbatsky, right?",Scotty
05x13,What?,Ted
05x13,Yes.,Robin
05x13,"I did not want to fix, it's just that I watch your show all the time.",Scotty
05x13,Really?,Robin
05x13,Really?,Ted
05x13,Bluntly. Why do you hang out with Ted?,Scotty
05x13,"Uh, this is Professor Mosby.",Ted
05x13,We're friends.,Robin
05x13,The cow! Robin Scherbatsky is friends with my art teacher.,Scotty
05x13,This is architecture. Go will study.,Ted
05x13,"And a second, you're Big caramel?",Scotty
05x13,Go!,Ted
05x13,Hello?,Marshall
05x13,"Hey baby, I go up there.",Lily
05x13,"What, why?",Marshall
05x13,"There was a problem at school, it was therefore the day. I thought to visit you, eat something with a nice little dessert.",Lily
05x13,"I have a problem, it was my wife. The first time I spoke to you, she thought you were a man, so...",Marshall
05x13,... then you're afraid she became insane upon learning that I am a woman.,Jenkins
05x13,Absolutely.,Marshall
05x13,"Good God, I was in a band improv. Am what I do.",Jenkins
05x13,"Hello, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.",Lily
05x13,"Hi Lily, I am of the French Embassy. I am here because of a little problem with cheese but important.",Jenkins
05x13,It is Jenkins.,Marshall
05x13,You are Jenkins?,Lily
05x13,"Yes, well, uh, I'll let you sort it out between you, see you later.",Jenkins
05x13,Marshall cracked. The moment he feared.,Ted 
05x13,"The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat?",Lily
05x13,"Wait, you're not jealous at all?",Marshall
05x13,"Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman.",Lily
05x13,"Because we love to madness, right?",Marshall
05x13,Yes of course. Let's eat.,Lily
05x13,It was not jealous at all.,Marshall
05x13,"Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.",Ted
05x13,What is this supposed to mean?,Marshall
05x13,"That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.",Robin
05x13,"Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.",Ted
05x13,"I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.",Marshall
05x13,"That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.",Robin
05x13,"No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.",Marshall
05x13,"Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.",Robin
05x13,What?,Marshall
05x13,Try your luck.,Robin
05x13,"So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V.  Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?",Ted
05x13,"I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee: thy pen.",Robin
05x13,"It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.",Ted
05x13,"Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work.",Robin
05x13,"No, it is not.",Ted
05x13,"Come on, stand New York.",Robin
05x13,I watch your show all the time.,Student
05x13,"Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?",Robin
05x13,"Thank you for last, Robin.",Ted
05x13,"That night, great show on poisons.  Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9.",Robin
05x13,"Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.",Ted
05x13,The truth is that we look for the drinking game.,Scotty
05x13,The what?,Ted
05x13,"As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says But um.",Student
05x13,But huh?,Barney
05x13,"But um, it would seem, she often said.",Ted
05x13,"It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...",Barney
05x13,It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.,Ted
05x13,"Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said But um so often?",Barney
05x13,"Tonight, we saw how much she often said.",Ted 
05x13,"It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?",Robin
05x13,"No, the third.",Boy
05x13,Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...,Robin
05x13,Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.,Marshall
05x13,Let me see.,Lily
05x13,"It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?",Marshall
05x13,I think sometimes it's the case.,Lily
05x13,But not for us?,Marshall
05x13,"No, of course not.",Lily
05x13,"Sure. Imagine, you have a gn to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.",Marshall
05x13,"I would say this is me, this is what is right.",Lily
05x13,"Now, the gn is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.",Marshall
05x13,"No, no weak or strong.",Lily
05x13,So this...,Marshall
05x13,"It went on for a while, until finally...",Ted 
05x13,"Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered: Art thou the weak or strong?",Marshall
05x13,And Oprah has tried everything?,Lily
05x13,Everything you need to decide now.,Marshall
05x13,"I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.",Lily
05x13,How can you say such a thing!,Marshall
05x13,"She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.",Marshall
05x13,"Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2.",Barney
05x13,"Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?",Ted
05x13,"Yes, an ordinary night for the Big caramel.",Marshall
05x13,Do you think she was flirting with me?,Marshall
05x13,Bluntly.,Ted
05x13,"Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the Big caramel... may move, ok let me try again.",Marshall
05x13,"Okay, I understand.",Ted
05x13,"Ted, I have a great idea.",Robin
05x13,Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.,Ted
05x13,"If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn.",Robin
05x13,"Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.",Ted
05x13,"Look, just because your class prefers me to you...",Robin
05x13,... You're a drinking game.,Ted
05x13,What?,Robin
05x13,"That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say But um, they take a shot.",Ted
05x13,But umm?,Robin
05x13,Yes.,Ted
05x13,"I'm not But um, I never told But hum.",Robin
05x13,"So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.",Ted
05x13,Hey Jenkins!,Marshall
05x13,Hey buddy!,Jenkins
05x13,"So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean...",Marshall
05x13,"Hey baby, what do you do at home?",Lily
05x13,"Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve.",Marshall
05x13,What?,Lily
05x13,"Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak.",Lily
05x13,You're sure it's not a fever?,Marshall
05x13,You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins.,Lily
05x13,"I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth.",Marshall
05x13,Of course it was.,Lily
05x13,It was silky... and hard as a branch of starfish,Marshall
05x13,"I'm so jealous, I'll go see it and hit right on the nose... like an old sandwich. Come on baby, you want some soup?",Lily
05x13,It happened! Have you... meatballs?,Marshall
05x13,And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions?,Ted
05x13,You want to come to the bar with us tonight?,Scotty
05x13,What?,Ted
05x13,"Yeah, we wanted to do some of Robin Scherbatsky, if you want to come?",Scotty
05x13,"Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay?",Ted
05x13,"So, your third book is your new novel, but um...",Robin
05x13,But hum!,"All, the student bar"
05x13,"Shit! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly?",Robin
05x13,"Oh, it's true!",Man
05x13,But umm...,Robin
05x13,But hum!,All
05x13,It's not pretty!,Ted
05x13,And that's when that Robin had an idea that would end the game forever.,Ted 
05x13,"I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um...",Robin
05x13,But hum!,All
05x13,"And tonight, you had to, but um...",Robin
05x13,But hum!,All
05x13,"For a long time, but um...",Robin
05x13,But hum!,All
05x13,"No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap!",Ted
05x13,"I think I should go, keep your  10!",Man
05x13,"Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um...",Robin
05x13,"We should drink professor, is the rule! She said but um.",Scotty
05x13,"My God, help us all!",Ted
05x13,Oh you're here! I'm really sorry to have embraced yesterday.,Jenkins
05x13,It's nothing.,Marshall
05x13,And I'm sorry I slept with you in the mail room.,Jenkins
05x13,It was not me!,Marshall
05x13,"Oh my God, that's embarrassing 2 discussions today. I do not do usually, I was totally stuffed.",Jenkins
05x13,You were drunk at 8am?,Marshall
05x13,"Yeah, I know not what has happened!",Jenkins
05x13,The police officer was unharmed but um...,Robin
05x13,But hum!  I gotta work!,Jenkins
05x13,Happy to have you helped you remember.,Marshall
05x13,"Damn, how I could do that!",Jenkins
05x13,It's nothing!,Marshall
05x13,"No, you know what it is not nothing. You are the coolest guy in the office that stupid. And I really do not want to spoil our friendship. This is so embarrassing, do not tell anyone please.",Jenkins
05x13,"No, who am I to say? Lily? I said to Lily.",Marshall
05x13,"For heaven's sake, I have to go talk to him, I must apologize!",Jenkins
05x13,"No, no!",Marshall
05x13,"If Marshall, I must say that it happened, it meant nothing... And I'm sorry.",Jenkins
05x13,"No, I... Yes! Yes! Do it!",Marshall
05x13,I'm going.,Jenkins
05x13,"And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.",Marshall
05x13,"So Lily, what I'm saying is that... It happened and I feel terrible. And I am truly sorry.",Jenkins
05x13,"Well, it happened! What will we do? It happened!Terrible, like you said. It happened!",Marshall
05x13,"Exactly, I feel bad and I hate myself. If what I have done you got injured or affected your relationship with Marshall, forgive me!",Jenkins
05x13,Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me.,Lily
05x13,"Marshall, you're in the field!",Barney
05x13,"Children, your Uncle Marshall was never tried again to make your aunt Lily jealous.",Ted 
05x13,Lil '? It's good!,Marshall
05x13,So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise!,Ted
05x13,How's you all?,Robin
05x13,"No, no, no, please. Just goes away!",Ted
05x13,I just wanted to tell you go...  To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!,Robin
05x14,There are ways to relieve stress.,Ted 
05x14,"You'll have a few minutes, Mr. Stinson.",Woman
05x14,Many people bite their nails. Others tap their feet.And others imagine themselves to be interviewed by renowned sports commentator Jim Nantz.,Ted 
05x14,"Hi friends, any sport has had its icon, which it excels. Ali was boxing, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with bombs snuff chance, my next guest, Mr Barney Stinson.Barney, welcome.",Jim
05x14,"Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.",Barney
05x14,"It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.",Jim
05x14,"Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary.",Barney
05x14,It all started when I decided to start a small challenge.,Barney
05x14,Oh my God. Wow.,Marshall
05x14,He decides his victim.,Ted
05x14,Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off!,Barney
05x14,Hi!,Marshall
05x14,Hi!,Robin
05x14,How did it go with Dale?,Lily
05x14,"You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.",Robin
05x14,"Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future.",Lily
05x14,The Yeti is not fictitious.,Marshall
05x14,That was fast.,Barney
05x14,"So, the first night was pretty normal.",Jim
05x14,"Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack.",Barney
05x14,Respect. Which brings us to the second night.,Jim
05x14,"That brings us to the second night. You see the bmb that pampers its Black Russian ? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me.",Barney
05x14,"Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?",Robin
05x14,How do you know he'll call?,Marshall
05x14,"How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.",Robin
05x14,"And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.",Ted
05x14,"How it happened at school today, Ted?",Lily
05x14,Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...,Ted
05x14,"Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys. You know, I expected a little maturity, coming from students like you, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously, what kind of fake name is Jen Coulin?",Ted
05x14,Present.,Student
05x14,"Come on guys, you would have at least been able to make it sound right. Jen Coulin?",Ted
05x14,Present.,Student
05x14,"What happened to classic? Sat Troulcu, Ted and Bill Oukoi, Maby Stoukette, Roland Cule, that's false names, but Jen Coulin?",Ted
05x14,Here.,Student
05x14,Jen Coulin!,Ted
05x14,It's just there.,Student
05x14,"Come on, I wait, swing all your jokes about Jen Coulin.",Ted
05x14,"We will not make jokes, Ted. I mean, this girl must really be in the hole.",Lily
05x14,You really soiled the name of Jen Coulin.,Marshall
05x14,Have you finished?,Ted
05x14,You asked him if she had reached the right exit?,Robin
05x14,"Wow, two in a row, Barney is thoroughly.",Lily
05x14,"This is a lucky girl, Barney was my best shot.",Robin
05x14,And this is the best friend I ever had.,Ted
05x14,It is everything I love that Marshall either.,Lily
05x14,It's all I want to be.,Marshall
05x14,I guess that's just what they said when I was gone.,Barney
05x14,"I believe it. You are awesome. Now, night 3. Describe it to us.",Jim
05x14,"Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice.",Barney
05x14,I think I'll take small tits tonight.,Barney
05x14,You're yucky.,Lily
05x14,"Lily, it's people too.",Barney
05x14,That's your burgers.,Wendy
05x14,thank you.,Marshall
05x14,Thank you.,Lily
05x14,You share it? Your share forever.,Ted
05x14,Of course not!,Lily
05x14,There is no such Bizarros who share everything.,Marshall
05x14,Of course I do.,Robin
05x14,That's exactly what you are.,Ted
05x14,It is perfectly normal.,Lily
05x14,What's happening guys?,Robin
05x14,"You know, Lily and I was looking for a new couple of friends since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella and Ted and Robin, and Ted... Ted and Victoria, when do you arrive to keep one?",Marshall
05x14,How we came up with that?,Ted
05x14,"It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out.",Lily
05x14,"And there, a tiny detail has surfaced, and it ruined the whole evening.",Marshall
05x14,"... and the toothbrush Joanna is ejected from the sink, facing the ceiling, and falls straight down the toilet.",Man
05x14,"It's crazy that last week, it happened the same with our toothbrushes.",Marshall
05x14,Our toothbrush?,Woman
05x14,Our toothbrush?,Ted
05x14,Our toothbrush?,Jim
05x14,Yeah.,Lily
05x14,"As in, a toothbrush?",Male
05x14,"As in, a toothbrush? You use both?",Robin
05x14,Every day?,Jim
05x14,That's weird?,Lily
05x14,"Marshall, 4 of 5 dentists have just vomited on.",Ted
05x14,"Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one.",Robin
05x14,"Wow. 3 girls in 3 nights. This is gross, even from Barney.",Lily
05x14,Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...,Ted
05x14,Do not tell! You're going to jinx him!,Marshall
05x14,Wear what bad luck?,Lily
05x14,I had left to do... flawless.,Barney
05x14,"It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection.",Barney
05x14,"Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder.",Jim
05x14,Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.,Barney
05x14,"It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield...",Jim
05x14,You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.,Barney
05x14,"... takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating.",Jim
05x14,"I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends.",Barney
05x14,Jen has not come into being today.,Ted
05x14,"Excuse me, Jen?",Marshall
05x14,"Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen.",Robin
05x14,Yeah.,Marshall
05x14,Jen Coulin.,Ted
05x14,"Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call?",Robin
05x14,Wait a second. Want it called?,Lily
05x14,No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?,Robin
05x14,Yeah. When did you start doing that too?,Ted
05x14,"It's been years! You had to know, you lived with us.",Marshall
05x14,"Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird.",Ted
05x14,We kept her in the bathroom.,Lily
05x14,"No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.",Ted
05x14,"Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?",Robin
05x14,Oh my god!,Marshall
05x14,Finish me!,Ted
05x14,I'm having so much!,Robin
05x14,"So you're at four, he'll just make a 5 to 7.",Jim
05x14,"Well done, Jim.",Barney
05x14,"Hey, I try. I'm not you. It was then comes the night No 5, and trouble with.",Jim
05x14,Beer! Salvation.,Ted
05x14,Hi. How is Barney?,Marshall
05x14,Like a charm. As all week.,Ted
05x14,Yeah? Hard to believe.,Marshall
05x14,Why?,Ted
05x14,"Apparently, this big merger last week went wrong, and Barney wears the hat.",Marshall
05x14,"Oh, it's weird. He said nothing.",Lily
05x14,"Even I who works with him, I just learned this afternoon when I walked past the office of his boss.",Marshall
05x14,"... what it has cost this company, Stinson?!",Pattern
05x14,I never thought about Barney so scared.,Marshall
05x14,I think he'll get fired.,Marshall
05x14,I can not believe that Barney is going to get fired.,Ted
05x14,"Yeah, they have a meeting Friday to see if he keeps his job or not.",Marshall
05x14,Poor guy. It must pinball.,Robin
05x14,I'll go talk to him.,Lily
05x14,No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what.,Ted
05x14,"Come on, it's his career. This is much more important than a stupid without...",Lily
05x14,"Ahh! Okay. You can lick my hand all you want, I will not let you ruin... Ouch!",Marshall
05x14,It must go talk to him.,Lily
05x14,I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.,Ted
05x14,Hey!,Barney
05x14,Is everything okay?,Ted
05x14,Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you.,Barney
05x14,Anything you want. What's the matter?,Ted
05x14,Which of these girls look the most stupid?,Barney
05x14,Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac.,Ted
05x14,"Thank you, Skip.",Barney
05x14,So what did he say?,Lily
05x14,"What? Oh, it will try with the girl holding the burger there.",Ted
05x14,You were supposed to talk about his loss of job.,Lily
05x14,"Lily, why is that force him to face a problem that can not adjust will help?",Ted
05x14,And why ignore it will fix things?,Lily
05x14,You're much ignored the problems of dental hygiene for a dozen years. And yet you seem to...,Ted

05x14,"I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any.",Barney
05x14,I think she cracked a bit for the Barnacle.,Jim
05x14,"You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz.",Barney
05x14,I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck.,Ted
05x14,He has no chance.,Marshall

05x14,"Oh, my God!",Ted
05x14,There's going to happen!,Marshall
05x14,"Yeah, you know? Doors-jinx, it does not exist.",Lily

05x14,"Oh, shit.",Robin
05x14,"And that's when Aunt Lily has seen what is great about sport, they make you forget about your problems, but only for a little while. And deep within us, we all needed this flawlessly.",Ted 
05x14,"At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end.",Ted
05x14,"Wait a minute! Aldrin was seen. She tries to escape, she jumps, and... I thought she would not do that.",Marshall
05x14,"Oh my God, are you?",Woman

05x15,"OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.",Ted

05x15,Holding up your phone number on national TV.,Lily
05x15,"I never had that problem. When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage. And I love my wife more and more every day.",Ranjit

05x15,Whaaat?!!,Robin
05x15,"See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has.

05x15,"Or this one, or this one, or this one...",Barney

05x15,And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir.,Marshall

05x15,I love that blazer. Almost as much as Robin loves Don.,Marshall
05x15,I do not love Don.,Robin
05x15,"Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.",Marshall
05x15,"You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.",Ted
05x15,"OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, wait a second, it's a duck! Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?",Ted
05x15,"Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought This guy's a duck, but one of these days you're gonna realize This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit.",Marshall
05x15,"Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.",Ted
05x15,What?!!,Marshall

05x15,Flavour counts.,Ted
05x15,Who carries a duck's foot for good luck? Anyone?,Marshall
05x15,"You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.  I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier?",Robin
05x15,"Hold on, I've got to get another book.",Ted
05x15,"Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?",Ted
05x15,"Because it's illegal, Ted!",Marshall
05x15,"Only if we bet on it, Marshall!",Ted
05x15,FINE! I CAN SEE IT! YOU WIN!,Marshall

05x15,Barney's phone... I wonder how it got in there?,Ted
05x15,Ted! Come on. Big date.,Robin
05x15,Uh what's the harm... Hello!,Ted
05x15,Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Ah ah ah I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Oooh! I gotta go.,Ted
05x15,"Oh, thank god, you're here.",Marshall
05x15,So rabbit or duck?,Waiter
05x15,"Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go.",Ted
05x15,"Well, heeellooooo.  Sorry, babe, I gotta take this. Barney's phone, Teddy Westside speaking.",Ted
05x15,My phone. I'm taking it back. And I'm taking your cool nickname too. Barney Westside speaking.,Barney
05x15,"No, no, I love it so much. It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Give it, give it.",Ted
05x15,"Hey, baby...",Barney
05x15,It's mine now.,Ted
05x15,It's not your phone.,Barney
05x15,Lily.  Aaaargh.,Marshall
05x15,Oops.,Lily
05x15,Being single sucks. It turns you into a crazy person.,Ted
05x15,I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what?,Robin
05x15,So long as you can find someone you can sit on the couch and put off cleaning the bathroom with.,Ted
05x15,"Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own.",Robin
05x15,Exactly.,Ted
05x15,Exactly.,Robin
05x15,"Robin, I have to apologize...",Don
05x15,Save it. Let's just do the news.,Robin
05x15,"No. Listen... after you left the other night, I was embarrassed. Not because I was naked. I'm actually pretty OK with my body.",Don
05x15,Clearly.,Robin
05x15,"I got married in college. I just got divorced three months ago. I have no idea how to be single. But that's not why I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed by my behavior right here at Channel...hmm, it starts with a 1, I know that, but...",Don
05x15,12.,Robin
05x15,12!...,Don
05x15,You can... just look at your mug.,Robin
05x15,"Right. Well, no, you look at this mug . You are a tremendous news anchor. And you deserve a co-anchor who gives a crap. And from here on out, it's gonna be me.",Don
05x15,"Well, I'll believe that when I see it.",Robin
05x15,"Well, you'll see it right now. I'll go get you some coffee.",Don
05x15,Don!! You're wearing pants!,Robin
05x15,"Well, look at that!",Don
05x15,"Uh, duck!",Robin
05x16,"The children in my stories, I'm a romantic idealist in search of true love. In it, I'm just stupid.",Ted 
05x16,"Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.",Ted
05x16,It's the lure of Ted.,Barney
05x16,Bait?,Lily
05x16,A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track.,Barney
05x16,As if she had to borrow a book or listen to old vinyl.,Ted
05x16,Or see your new poster rap.,Marshall
05x16,Post rap? On which it would work?,Robin
05x16,It was the first week of college. I was way into Wu-Tang Clan.,Lily
05x16,"It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening.",Barney
05x16,The slot machine is too much fun. And a trampoline... that's actually too dangerous. But I finally found the perfect bait... A mini pig.,Barney
05x16,A mini pig? On which it would work?,Ted
05x16,You got a mini pig?,Lily
05x16,You can see the mini pig?,Robin
05x16,I can borrow your mini pig?,Ted
05x16,"Yes, you can borrow.",Barney
05x16,You have a mini pig? I can not believe it! You're too cute!You're the cutest little pig on Earth! What?,Tiffany
05x16,You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on In high school I was super shy and I in my skin?,Ted
05x16,I was shy and ill at ease. I'd like 50 more pounds and protruding teeth.,Tiffany
05x16,Seriously?,Ted
05x16,No. I was always canon. What can I do? You know who else would love this mini pig?  My boyfriend.,Tiffany
05x16,You got a boyfriend?,Ted
05x16,"I know... Boring, eh? Finally, it is... not really my boyfriend.",Tiffany
05x16,Okay.,Ted
05x16,"Well, technically it is.",Tiffany
05x16,He is or not?,Ted
05x16,A little each but not both.,Tiffany
05x16,Do you understand anything?,Ted
05x16,"I appreciate you. But you must be patient. I do not want to lose you, my Dark Brown.",Tiffany
05x16,Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.,Ted
05x16,She gave you her hook.,Robin
05x16,What? I am not to his hook.,Ted
05x16,"Yes, completely.",Barney
05x16,"It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry.",Robin
05x16,Who would buy a can of chili for not eating it away?,Lily
05x16,"Amen, sister.",Marshall
05x16,"Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems.",Robin
05x16,"I've been hooked. Lisa Walker. See the scene... In 1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.",Marshall
05x16,"So I was, like, thinking, Lisa, do, perhaps you want, like, go out with me?",Marshall
05x16,"It sounds great. But I'm seeing this guy. It has a LeBaron convertible and an unlimited pass to the rink, so I would not miss it.",Lisa
05x16,I understand.,Marshall
05x16,What if we did that? You could be my secret boyfriend who does all my homework.,Lisa
05x16,Okay. Wanna see my post of rap?,Marshall
05x16,Whore posting!,Lily
05x16,So... Lisa Walker gave me false hope for months until one night I went to tell him how much I loved her. In song.,Marshall
05x16,"She was not home yet so I waited. And expected. I woke up, covered with snow, after 4h. And then I saw them. The footprints of Lisa. She had passed right by me to the house.",Marshall
05x16,It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook.,Marshall
05x16,That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.,Ted
05x16,You interest me very much. But I can not be with you for now.,Tiffany
05x16,Right now is the catch phrase of choice.,Robin
05x16,"For now you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.",Marshall
05x16,It's like that. I can not be with you. For now.,Barney
05x16,"I think my high school boyfriend Scooter, is a little to my hook.",Lily
05x16,A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover.,Marshall
05x16,It's weird when I see him at work.,Lily
05x16,Wait. What?,Marshall
05x16,Scooter works in the Ikea cafeteria 'school. We talked.,Lily
05x16,Nice dress. French fries? I love you.,Scooter
05x16,We certainly do not talk about that!,Marshall
05x16,But if. I talked to full time. Scooter canteen.,Lily
05x16,"I thought you was talking about a long-awaited means of transport, carrying such poor canteen.",Marshall
05x16,It explains a lot.,Lily
05x16,Scooter canteen was still there today.,Lily
05x16,You're mounted on it? You did a tour?,Marshall
05x16,No!,Lily
05x16,Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two.,Marshall
05x16,So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school?,Marshall
05x16,Are you jealous?,Lily
05x16,I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. Shit!,Marshall
05x16,I tried!,Lily
05x16,I saw that you had free time. So do I. And if you fled?,Scooter
05x16,"Let me be clear, Scooter. There is no way that you and I are together. For now.",Lily
05x16,See you tomorrow. It's Tuesday Tijuana.,Scooter
05x16,For now? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook.,Marshall
05x16,"You're right. Tomorrow, that's what I'll do.",Lily
05x16,Why not tomorrow?,Marshall
05x16,I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday.,Lily
05x16,Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?,Barney
05x16,I will not give up.,Ted
05x16,I should have quit.,Ted 
05x16,This girl is special.,Ted
05x16,It was the devil!,Ted 
05x16,It will get better with Tiffany.,Ted
05x16,"No, moron!",Ted 
05x16,"Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever.",Barney
05x16,There she is.  It has led to colleagues.,Ted
05x16,Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?,Barney
05x16,Yep.,Ted
05x16,"There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?",Barney
05x16,How do you know?,Ted
05x16,And you never thought to say?,Barney
05x16,What? It's just a job.,Ted
05x16,"That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls gns, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?",Barney
05x16,I will not say explicitly.,Ted
05x16,"It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. hm erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs.  So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.",Barney
05x16,Hi my great darkness. How are you?,Tiffany
05x16,"Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?",Ted
05x16,"No, sir.",Tiffany
05x16,She touched my nose.,Ted
05x16,"Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees burned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!",Barney
05x16,"I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes?  Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day.",Marshall
05x16,"Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now.",Lily
05x16,Go! Be a man!,Marshall
05x16,"I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes.",Lily
05x16,"You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that.",Marshall
05x16,I still do.,Lily
05x16,Not as much. Not as much.,Marshall
05x16,"There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever.",Barney
05x16,"Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.",Ted
05x16,You're always on the hook.,Robin
05x16,Look what we did yesterday.,Ted
05x16,"First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual.",Ted
05x16,And let me guess: it's not gone further than that.,Robin
05x16,"Well, no, but...",Ted
05x16,"And tell me, would you have accidentally made this chocolate cake?",Lily
05x16,It was a pre-made.,Ted
05x16,There's no shame to admit it. We were all hooked and we all hooked someone.,Lily
05x16,I've never done that.,Ted
05x16,Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?,Robin
05x16,Henrietta and I are just friends.,Ted
05x16,It is too much to your hook.,Robin
05x16,Absolutely not.,Ted
05x16,"Yes, completely. Finally...",Ted 
05x16,"... it was spoiled. We shared a chocolate cake. It made me long foot massages. I'm not proud of, children.",Ted 
05x16,"You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego.",Robin
05x16,You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?,Ted
05x16,Mike and I are just friends.,Robin
05x16,Come on.,Ted
05x16,"Yeah, right.",Robin
05x16,You never thought to go to the next step with me?,Mike
05x16,"If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup.",Robin
05x16,It's a deal.,Mike
05x16,What! I do not keep Mike in my hook.,Robin
05x16,You're Captain Hook.,Ted
05x16,"Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to.",Robin
05x16,That's not why it's good.,Ted
05x16,"And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?",Robin
05x16,"Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends.",Ted
05x16,I love you. What? Want a foot massage? Because I'm driven on me.,Henrietta
05x16,"No, that's fine.",Ted
05x16,"I did not know if you were hungry, I did some stuff... Nothing special.",Henrietta
05x16,"Children, looking back, I do not know how I have not seen Henrietta was crazy about me.",Ted 
05x16,Hello?,Ted
05x16,Hey Ted!,Tiffany
05x16,Hey Tiffany!,Ted
05x16,I go to the country this weekend at a friends wedding.Wanna be my cavalier?,Tiffany
05x16,"I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend?",Ted
05x16,"Yeah, it's not a concern.",Henrietta
05x16,"It works, yeah.",Ted
05x16,You have the strength.,Henrietta
05x16,What a jerk.,Ted 
05x16,Wait. Where is Ted? I thought we would finally meet him.,Mother of Henrietta
05x16,"An unexpected, okay, Mom?",Henrietta
05x16,I told you there was not.,Father
05x16,I heard.,Henrietta
05x16,"So there I was, at one of the surest signs to make a landing in a relationship: a country wedding. It finally came.",Ted 
05x16,Champagne?,Ted
05x16,I forgot to call you.,Tiffany
05x16,"Whatever it is, we can talk now.",Ted
05x16,This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding. We just get back together.,Tiffany
05x16,Now that I think a call would have been nice.,Ted
05x16,Is that you Ted? But I heard you were doing a great chocolate cake.,Jack
05x16,It is not great? And it is in a group. Thank you.,Tiffany
05x16,"Come on, Lily. You must drop Scooter. Try it again.",Marshall
05x16,Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. For now.,Lily
05x16,Act like a man!,Marshall
05x16,Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. Ever.,Lily
05x16,Finish him!,Marshall
05x16,It will never be together in any sexual way again.,Lily
05x16,Well done. Weird thing to say to a pig.,Marshall
05x16,Really bad.,Lily
05x16,"Well, I do not think it will work out between us. For now.",Tiffany
05x16,And that's when it hit me. I was at his hook. I also realized...,Ted 
05x16,"You've missed so much, baby.",Tiffany
05x16,Tiffany was to hook this guy. It was a vicious circle.Henrietta was my hook. And years later I learned that this poor guy was on the hook of Henrietta.,Ted 
05x16,You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done.  And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.,Ted
05x16,I can do it alone.,Lily
05x16,So prove it. And... take me a pudding.,Marshall
05x16,"Listen, Scooter. There is no way we ever be together.",Lily
05x16,Right now! I'm sorry but he is adorable.,Marshall
05x16,Listen. I want to be with you.,Lily
05x16,So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.,Marshall
05x16,Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?,Barney
05x16,There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.,Robin
05x16,I want you to meet the latest arrival.,Woman
05x16,Nice to meet you. I represent statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.,Woman 2
05x16,Let's go have a drink.,Woman
05x16,It's over.,Barney
05x16,What?,Robin
05x16,The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era.,Barney
05x16,You're a little dramatic.,Robin
05x16,"Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!",Barney
05x16,So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook.,Ted 
05x16,This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding.,Tiffany
05x16,I'm done.,Ted
05x16,The answer is yes!,Henrietta
05x16,It's worse.,Ted
05x16,"This is perfect! Mom, Dad! Ted asked me to marry him!",Henrietta
05x16,I knew this would happen!,Mother
05x16,My son!,Father
05x16,"Yeah, there was a...",Ted
05x16,What did you do?,Robin
05x16,"Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.",Ted
05x16,"Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.",Ted
05x16,Right now?,Henrietta
05x16,Ever.,Ted
05x16,"But we're still going to marry, does not it?",Henrietta
05x16,It was violent.,Ted
05x16,"Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative.  I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?",Robin
05x16,Another tour.,Mike
05x16,It can wait.,Robin
05x16,How are you?,Robin
05x16,You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?,Ted
05x16,I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.,Barney
05x16,Why change your mind?,Robin
05x16,"The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!",Barney
05x17,"Children, during a warm evening in March 2010, the New York police rescued a 34 year old man from the Hudson River... your Uncle Barney.",Ted 
05x17,"Okay, big guy, tell me all along.",Police
05x17,It all started a week ago.,Barney
05x17,I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.,Barney
05x17,Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.,Woman
05x17,Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.,Barney
05x17,But this is merely a tie.,Woman
05x17,It was not my best tie.,Barney
05x17,Right.,Police
05x17,"So, right after that, I took her home.",Barney
05x17,"When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.",Woman
05x17,"Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.",Barney
05x17,Good night.,Woman
05x17,"What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.",Barney
05x17,I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.,Robin
05x17,Thanks to this young woman to my left. This report on how rodent avoided in the subway...,Don
05x17,The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents.,Robin
05x17,"I gotta go, okay? See you soon.",Don
05x17,Nice to meet you.,Marshall
05x17,I do too.,Don
05x17,"This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else.",Marshall
05x17,I hope you do not talk to you.,Robin
05x17,It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.,Lily
05x17,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.",Marshall
05x17,"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.",Barney
05x17,"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word sx?",Ted
05x17,"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really sx, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.",Woman
05x17,Continuous. Continues.,Barney
05x17,Did she used an excuse for physical contact?,Ted
05x17,It's the cashmere?,Woman
05x17,Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.,Barney
05x17,12 microns. I like the tight fibers.,Female
05x17,"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",Barney
05x17,She did it too!,Barney
05x17,"And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week?",Ted
05x17,"You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.",Barney
05x17,"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.",Woman
05x17,Did you just say you got a kid!,Barney
05x17,You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.,Woman
05x17,Completely.,Barney
05x17,Or the second. Or the third.,Woman
05x17,Of course. Well...,Barney
05x17,Or the fourth.,Woman
05x17,Just tell me how!,Barney
05x17,17.,Female
05x17,"Excuse me, someone is using this stool?",Barney
05x17,That is: no sx before hot date 17th.,Ted
05x17,"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.",Lily
05x17,"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...",Barney
05x17,From Robin is Robin.,Ted
05x17,I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.,Barney
05x17,Listen... You wanna go out on Saturday night?,Don
05x17,Saturday night?,Robin
05x17,It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!,Marshall
05x17,"Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great...",Robin
05x17,"Yes, I'm going out with you.","Marshall, with the phone in the kitchen"
05x17,"Robin, you okay?",Don
05x17,"I just have a cold. That's why for my voice.  But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.",Marshall
05x17,But what are you doing?,Robin
05x17,"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",Marshall
05x17,I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.,Barney
05x17,"That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.",Lily
05x17,"Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.",Robin
05x17,You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?,Lily
05x17,It was my show.,Robin
05x17,"But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...",Robin
05x17,"I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is no.By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining.",Anita
05x17,"Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.",Robin
05x17,It's good. You want a coffee?,Mike
05x17,"Absolutely, Mike, great idea.",Robin
05x17,You?,Mike
05x17,"No. And you, Robin? You go out with someone?",Anita
05x17,I have not really want right now.,Robin
05x17,You were broken heart?,Anita
05x17,"And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...",Robin
05x17,"That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it.",Anita
05x17,That's to say?,Robin
05x17,I will use the power of no to destroy your friend Barney.Say it.,Anita
05x17,"Come on, it does not really work, though?",Robin
05x17,"I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee.",Mike
05x17,"Thank you, Mike. Think about it.",Anita
05x17,"I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.",Robin
05x17,"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and...",Barney
05x17,It does.,Robin
05x17,"Spoilers. Regardless, we did.",Barney
05x17,"It's done.  Thank you, Mike.",Anita
05x17,"I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the shting range.",Robin
05x17,I hope this was not the same nights.,Lily
05x17,"Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.",Robin
05x17,You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.,Marshall
05x17,"You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.",Lily
05x17,She cried? Real tears? It means...,Marshall
05x17,Marshall understood what he had been con with Robin.,Ted 
05x17,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang...",Marshall
05x17,How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.,Marshall
05x17,"I know, but the song is rather catchy.",Lily
05x17,Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?,Barney
05x17,There is another option... but you're not ready.,Ted
05x17,Tell me.,Barney
05x17,"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",Ted
05x17,A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,Barney
05x17,"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.",Ted
05x17,Okay.,Barney
05x17,Let me do it. I will plan everything.,Ted
05x17,You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?,Barney
05x17,Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...,Ted
05x17,What are you doing?,Barney
05x17,You just gotta make him understand...,Ted singing
05x17,They look at us.,Barney
05x17,How important it is for you...,Ted
05x17,Really? You really gonna do that?,Barney
05x17,"In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.","Ted, still singing"
05x17,It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?,Barney
05x17,Box strip.,Ted
05x17,"Finally, the night of the great rencards arrived.",Ted 
05x17,Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.,Marshall
05x17,I just... I canceled.,Robin
05x17,How does it... Wait.,Marshall
05x17,A problem?,Lily
05x17,Robin canceled his hot date.,Marshall
05x17,What? She was super excited there is one hour.,Ted
05x17,You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.,Ted
05x17,Thank you.,Robin
05x17,You're excited to go out with Don?,Ted
05x17,You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.,Robin
05x17,"I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at Tombeur panties. They call it a super hot date.",Ted
05x17,Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!,Marshall
05x17,She seemed happy after the break.,Ted
05x17,You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.,Marshall
05x17,"Wait, but that would mean...",Ted
05x17,And I understood what I had been con with Robin.,Ted 
05x17,You sing what?,Ted
05x17,A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.,Marshall
05x17,I'll sing a verse.,Ted
05x17,Super.,Marshall
05x17,Where is she?,Ted
05x17,I think it is the toilet.,Marshall
05x17,"I'm fine, I'm fine.",Robin
05x17,Why did you do that?,Barney
05x17,"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.",Marshall
05x17,Why are you angry against me?,Barney
05x17,You were a real asshle to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.,Ted
05x17,The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.,Barney
05x17,You see nothing.,Ted
05x17,Typical of a guy.,Marshall
05x17,"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.",Lily
05x17,"What, she is upset?",Barney
05x17,"Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.",Lily
05x17,Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.,Ted 
05x17,You should have seen.,Barney
05x17,I'm going.,Robin
05x17,We go back home...,Barney
05x17,I can not believe that Robin is upset.,Barney
05x17,And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.,Marshall
05x17,I did worse after the premiere of The Phantom Menace.It's been like that since we broke up?,Barney
05x17,"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.",Lily
05x17,I know where.,Barney
05x17,"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.",Robin
05x17,I know you're upset.,Barney
05x17,"What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my fcking heart.",Robin
05x17,You sure you're not upset?,Barney
05x17,Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?,Robin
05x17,You're not another number for me.,Barney
05x17,"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.",Robin
05x17,"I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?",Barney
05x17,"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.",Robin
05x17,"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.",Barney
05x17,Do not sleep with Anita.,Robin
05x17,I promise.,Barney
05x17,Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?,Robin
05x17,It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.,Barney
05x17,"Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.",Ted 
05x17,I wanted to call you.,Barney
05x17,"I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?",Anita
05x17,"I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.",Barney
05x17,"I see. You try the trick of no. You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.",Anita
05x17,No.,Barney
05x17,The 11th?,Anita
05x17,No.,Barney
05x17,The fifth?,Anita
05x17,No.,Barney
05x17,Tonight?,Anita
05x17,No.,Barney
05x17,This evening before dinner?,Anita
05x17,No.,Barney
05x17,And you? You're interested.,"Anita, Ted"
05x17,Yeah.,Ted
05x17,Go.,Anita
05x17,I'm sorry. The answer is no.,Barney
05x17,"Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.",Anita
05x17,Here is my story.,Barney
05x17,This is a  500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.,Police
05x17,I hope so too.,Barney
05x17,This is an old story of married women.,Ted
05x17,How was this date?,Marshall
05x17,Good enough. Pretty... pretty good.,Robin
05x17,How so?,Ted
05x17,"Come on, guys. It was good. It was nice. We spent a pleasant evening. Let... Let him that. Even if...",Robin
05x18,"Children, your aunt Lily has always been among those who like their birthday. Really.",Ted 
05x18,00 and Lily wakes.,The alarm goes off at 12

05x18,00.,The clock shows 9

05x18,Because he loves to prepare on birthdays.,Ted 
05x18,"Feliz cumpleanos, baby. The theme of this breakfast in bed is... Spanish Interlude.  How have we landed on the lyric rolling hills of northern Spain? Baby, it will be huge tonight. We five, dinner well dressed, and Ted brings your cognac cheesecake Pumpkin at Edgar. I'll go shopping super secret birthday. And I took him because I do not like the way he looks at you.",Marshall
05x18,"A new camera! Thank you, Marshall. I love it!",Lily
05x18,"Small bonus, I took pictures of me naked before packing. With a node.",Marshall
05x18,There was not a knot.,Lily
05x18,On the other device.,Marshall
05x18,Thank you. I will make great photos of our group with that.,Lily
05x18,"Children, have you seen the photo album of Lily... Bound in leather, acid-free paper, adorable handwritten captions. And most importantly, the group photo. Nice picture, eh? But what you do not see are the 10 seconds before this photo was taken.",Ted 
05x18,I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.,Lily
05x18,Why?,Barney
05x18,"You know... Light, color, balance, aperture...",Lily
05x18,"You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?",Robin
05x18,Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.,Lily
05x18,How dare you?,Barney
05x18,It's so rude.,Robin
05x18,It's true.,Barney
05x18,"Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.",Robin
05x18,We hated group photos of Lily.,Ted 
05x18,"Okay, I am perhaps a little bossy, but I want to remember it all. Like tonight. I imagine no better birthday being with my 4 best friends only.  And Ted's here.",Lily
05x18,Happy Birthday! Here is Amanda.,Ted

05x18,Her favorite color is... leg.,Amanda

05x18,Pretty.,Lily
05x18,"Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life...",Marshall

05x18,It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.,Robin
05x18,"Nope, not at all.",Barney
05x18,And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.,Robin
05x18,"Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.",Barney
05x18,"He was right. Your uncle Marshall is many things well, but for the pictures, it's terrible.",Ted 
05x18,They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.,Marshall

05x18,No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?,Robin
05x18,It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.,Barney
05x18,"Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?",Ted
05x18,"These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.",Lily

05x18,2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months.,Marshall

05x18,2 months! My balls were blue! Blue!,Marshall

05x18,You sure?,Barney
05x18,Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!,Robin

05x18,"Here is another. More random bitch to my birthday! Hey, baby!",Lily
05x18,You have a cake rack?,Amanda
05x18,The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!,Lily
05x18,"I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.",Robin
05x18,Names that bitch!,Woman
05x18,Uh...,Man

05x18,Absolutely.,Lily
05x18,Attention Lily. It's a trap.,Marshall
05x18,"Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.",Ted
05x18,"Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.",Lily
05x18,I'm starting to cry.,Robin
05x18,"It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this: She's cute She's cute.",Marshall
05x18,I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.,Ted
05x18,And nice and sweet and so nice!,Marshall Robin. Your part is this
05x18,Yes. We are a family. So why these parties can not they be us?,Lily
05x18,Like the time we celebrated the success of Marshall to the bar.,Lily
05x18,Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.,Ted
05x18,I did not say that!,Ted
05x18,It's as if you had done.,Lily
05x18,Here's Framboise.,Ted
05x18,You must order more food?,Marshall
05x18,No. Raspberry does not eat.,Ted
05x18,I am a vegetarian.,Raspberry
05x18,"Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you.",Lily
05x18,Meat is mrder!  mrder!,Raspberry
05x18,I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?,Ted
05x18,It was called Raspberry!,All
05x18,"If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.",Ted

05x18,And that's it. I hope you will like.,Amanda
05x18,"Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori.",Lily
05x18,"Children, you remember the look you're dead to me Lily, she has this expression before exploding in a rage?Well, that was not it. But it was that of Marshall.",Ted 
05x18,"42nd? Does the fcking bmb appeared to have 42 years? Or worse, she has a mind to call Lori?!",Marshall
05x18,"No, Marshall, it does not matter.",Lily
05x18,If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!,Marshall
05x18,I'm sorry.,Amanda
05x18,Out!,Marshall
05x18,"Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.",Ted
05x18,"You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.",Marshall
05x18,What are you talking?,Ted
05x18,"You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.",Marshall
05x18,"I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?",Marshall
05x18,We broke... again! You sit with me a little while? Just sit down?,Natalie
05x18,You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.,Marshall
05x18,"And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.",Marshall
05x18,"I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.",Marshall
05x18,"I just thought we had something special, you know?",Woman
05x18,"Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling.",Marshall
05x18,I know if I'll get over it.,Woman
05x18,Shut up.,Marshall
05x18,"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.",Ted
05x18,They would be if Marshall was not on it.,Barney
05x18,Cheap Shot. Low blow.,Marshall
05x18,You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.,Ted
05x18,This is not true!,Lily
05x18,"Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.",Ted
05x18,"It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.",Marshall
05x18,"And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.",Ted
05x18,And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.,Robin
05x18,"Yeah, but you were beautiful.",Lily
05x18,And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.,Robin
05x18,"Actually, it was a good evening.",Marshall
05x18,It's true.,Lily
05x18,"Yeah, that was good.",Ted
05x18,Look at that one. This is the first picture of us three.,Lily
05x18,It's true.,Marshall
05x18,Do you remember what happened?,Ted
05x18,"Well, are you ready?",Man
05x18,"Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?",Ted

05x18,"Cool. Fine. One, two...",Man
05x18,"Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?",Lily
05x18,Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.,Marshall
05x18,And if you came to ask us?,Ted
05x18,Really?,Lily
05x18,Yeah.,Ted
05x18,"What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?",Marshall
05x18,And if you break it?,Ted
05x18,Come.,Marshall
05x18,I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.,Lily
05x18,I liked you.,Ted
05x18,We must bring back Amanda.,Lily
05x18,Really?,Ted
05x18,"You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.",Lily
05x18,"Thank you, Lil.",Ted
05x18,I think Lori's age made him very wise.,Robin
05x18,It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.,Barney
05x18,So your aunt Lily called Amanda.,Ted 
05x18,"Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
05x18,"Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.",Ted
05x18,It's a hole in your jacket?,Robin
05x18,What? Where?,Barney
05x18,"Now, Marshall!",Ted
05x18,Shit!,Robin
05x18,Names that bitch.,Lily
05x18,Ann has...? Anna?,Ted
05x18,"No, it was my birthday.",Lily
05x18,Your brain is too predictable associations.,Marshall
05x18,"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
05x18,Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...,Barney
05x18,Yes!,Robin
05x19,"Kids, you have to wonder if everything I am telling you is true. And this is normal. After all, the limit is fine between a good story and a lie.",Ted 
05x19,No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.,Ted 
05x19,I love traveling.,Barney
05x19,Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?,Woman
05x19,"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.",Barney
05x19,You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.,Ted
05x19,"Ted, a blonde, it's easy.",Barney
05x19,"Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.",Barney
05x19,"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.",Marshall
05x19,"So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space.",Barney
05x19,Why are you lying all the time?,Ted
05x19,"I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!",Barney
05x19,I hate my job.,Robin
05x19,What? You had not interviewed the mayor?,Marshall
05x19,"Mayor McWouaf. It teaches the children clean, dressed dog. Finally, it is supposed to.",Robin
05x19,I do not want to talk about Mayor McWouaf. I mean those amazing shoes at Bon Pied-A-Ti! Watch as they absorb the shock!,Mayor
05x19,The table! There was a table... Back.  were returned.,Robin
05x19,Sorry Robin. I was bored.,Mike
05x19,"Yeah, I understand.",Robin
05x19,"A single interview proper, it would be nice for a change.",Robin
05x19,"Okay, I look at my calendar, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions in advance and nothing about my private life.",Ted
05x19,"Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published.",Robin
05x19,You have nabbed seven in a row?,Marshall
05x19,seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.,Ted
05x19,That's the thing with which you played the other day?,Robin
05x19,I was playing it. I was working.,Ted
05x19,It's you.  It's me.  I saw you in the street.  Are you Annie?  Yes.,Ted
05x19,Ted? You redo the end of Sleepless in Seattle with Polly Pocket?,"Robin, out of his room"
05x19,How long are you here?,Ted
05x19,Ten seconds.,Robin
05x19,"Yeah, just the end.",Ted
05x19,Again?,Marshall
05x19,"This is the pizza. Baby, you got the cash?",Lily
05x19,"You know, in fact, it was not me who should pay.Because I do not really like pizza.",Marshall
05x19,What!?,Lily
05x19,It was literally across the country a hundred times for a pizza.,Ted
05x19,I even caught a pizza in the shower.,Lily
05x19,Our coupons are your effigy.,Delivery Man
05x19,"I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, stop eating pizza. Marshall: Why? Doc: To you examine.  But seriously, we laugh because we love you.",Barney
05x19,"Okay, so I have no money on me... it's because... I was assaulted.",Marshall
05x19,You...?,Lily
05x19,What?,Ted
05x19,"You can pay Arthur? I have the slab! How is your father, anyway?",Marshall
05x19,Better.,Arthur
05x19,That's good.,Marshall
05x19,Did you get mugged?,Lily
05x19,Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said Hands up! ?,Barney
05x19,"Yes, because I was assaulted in 1947 at the corner of Abbott and Costello. But no. I cut through Central Park back from work.",Marshall
05x19,Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
05x19,It's good. It's good.,Marshall
05x19,It was downright terrifying.,Marshall
05x19,It was downright terrifying.,Barney
05x19,What are you doing?,Marshall
05x19,I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.,Barney
05x19,It will not work. If?,Marshall
05x19,Not a bit.,Lily
05x19,I authorize you to do.,Marshall
05x19,"I do not think there's a gn to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night.",Lily
05x19,"Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep.  Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a fcking baby.",Robin
05x19,Robin puts it.,Ted
05x19,It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.,Robin
05x19,"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a gn. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.",Marshall
05x19,I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.,Barney
05x19,"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?",Marshall
05x19,It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you.,Barney
05x19,"Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it.",Lily
05x19,I changed! I like the wapons now. Charger.,Lily
05x19,Maybe there should be a pause..,Robin
05x19,"I said, shipper.",Lily
05x19,You wanna buy a gn?,Marshall
05x19,"No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works.",Lily
05x19,"You do not need a wapon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no wapon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally.",Marshall
05x19,"Pretty easy, huh?  You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!",Marshall
05x19,I have changed my mind.,Lily
05x19,"Now, you want to add a wapon in this equation?",Marshall
05x19,"I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a gn at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would...",Lily
05x19,"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.",Marshall
05x19,So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!,Barney
05x19,He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all.,Marshall
05x19,"Wait, so...",Ted
05x19,Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
05x19,It's good. It's good.,Marshall
05x19,He assaulted you naked?,Lily
05x19,I do not ask where he kept his wapon.,Barney
05x19,We're sure it was a wapon?,Ted
05x19,"No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo.",Marshall
05x19,Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
05x19,It's good. It's good.,Marshall
05x19,You're telling us...,Barney
05x19,What you got mugged...,Ted
05x19,For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
05x19,You've been mugged by a monkey?,Barney
05x19,"Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a wapon.",Marshall
05x19,Forget the wapon. It is on that now.,Lily
05x19,The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,Ted
05x19,This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,Lily
05x19,Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,Barney
05x19,Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,Marshall
05x19,"Hi, friends. What's new?","Robin, who happens"
05x19,New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,Barney
05x19,Really? They caught him?,Robin
05x19,He is behind bars.,Ted
05x19,"So, where did they find?",Robin
05x19,"I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.",Lily
05x19,I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.,Robin
05x19,"You know how they caught him, huh?",Ted
05x19,They tracked.,Marshall
05x19,They tracked!,Ted
05x19,What's happening?,Robin
05x19,Okay. That's what happened.,Marshall
05x19,"No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",Barney
05x19,"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",Marshall
05x19,You're right. The banana was on the floor.,Barney
05x19,Was not... Was not banana banana.,Marshall
05x19,"Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",Barney
05x19,Do not sht. There was no banana!,Marshall
05x19,"Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",Robin
05x19,"This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",Marshall
05x19,You've been mugged by a monkey!,Lily
05x19,It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,Ted
05x19,What? Him in your program? And my model?,Ted
05x19,No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,Robin
05x19,"First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",Ted
05x19,"So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",Robin
05x19,"Only if they are holding up well. Last year, I found one of her frolicking with GI Joe. This is not funny. What were you thinking? And if you were pregnant?",Men
05x19,And you invited back for a second interview.,Ted
05x19,"Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?",Robin
05x19,It would be nice to see you on TV.,Lily
05x19,Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?,Marshall
05x19,You've been mugged by a monkey.,Lily
05x19,I've just been mugged.,Barney
05x19,What?,Ted
05x19,That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,Barney
05x19,It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.,Barney
05x19,My poor darling.,Woman
05x19,Neil? Neil!,Woman 2
05x19,"Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...",Barney
05x19,Why you call it Neil?,Woman
05x19,Because it's his name. This is Neil Armstrong.,Woman 2
05x19,The cyclist?,Woman
05x19,You're not supposed to be on a space mission?,Woman 2
05x19,You've just mugged?,Woman
05x19,"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",Barney
05x19,Me.,Woman 2
05x19,Me too.,Woman
05x19,And it was the best thing in my life 3.,Barney
05x19,"Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.",Ted
05x19,You're the lemon in your hair.,Marshall
05x19,"The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",Barney
05x19,"Marshall, you never will believe. I spoke to my producer monkey aggressor and he loves!","Robin, entering"
05x19,Really? Cool.,Marshall
05x19,Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,Robin
05x19,"Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",Marshall
05x19,"The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",Robin
05x19,"Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",Marshall
05x19,It's a little embarrassing. So what?,Ted
05x19,That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey.,Marshall
05x19,"So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?",Ted
05x19,Not at all.,Marshall
05x19,So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,Barney
05x19,"No, that's not it.",Marshall
05x19,So you got the monkey attacked?,Ted
05x19,"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gn.",Marshall
05x19,"You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?",Barney
05x19,That would be the right size.,Ted
05x19,"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a wapon. In truth, it never happened.",Marshall
05x19,I can not believe.,Barney
05x19,What?,Marshall
05x19,You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,Barney
05x19,I would not?,Marshall
05x19,"If serious, this is too funny.",Barney
05x19,"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.",Marshall
05x19,"I, yes, but still.",Barney
05x19,But I can not lie on national TV.,Marshall
05x19,You know a long time. He told the truth?,Barney
05x19,"Ted, do not do that...",Marshall
05x19,I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,Ted
05x19,I still say that it happened.,Barney
05x19,"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",Ted
05x19,"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",Barney
05x19,"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",Ted
05x19,"False! They like to discover that they lied. Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth. Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!",Barney
05x19,You mean what you done to him.,Marshall
05x19,"No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",Barney
05x19,"Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.",Barney
05x19,"Yes, Neil?",Lisa
05x19,"It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.",Barney
05x19,"Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.",Lisa
05x19,"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!",Barney
05x19,This is the belt of Planar 3?,"Lily, what happens"
05x19,You know it.,Barney
05x19,Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gn? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.,Lily
05x19,You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
05x19,Yeah! I knew it.,Barney
05x19,Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,Ted
05x19,"Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",Barney
05x19,"Come on, Ted.",Marshall
05x19,"Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.",Ted
05x19,"Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.",Ted 
05x19,"Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?",Robin
05x19,"I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.",Ted
05x19,It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,Robin
05x19,"Dude, what do you do?",Barney
05x19,"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",Ted
05x19,Now I want a wapon.,Barney
05x19,The monkey is there.,Marshall
05x19,Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.,Robin
05x19,"Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.",Man
05x19,I bet he will love it.,Lily
05x19,"No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.",Man
05x19,The name of his companion is Milly?,Marshall
05x19,And then the interview began.,Ted 
05x19,"In your own words, describe what happened.",Robin
05x19,"Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",Marshall
05x19,We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,Robin
05x19,"People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can sht it?",Marshall
05x19,We come back.,Robin
05x19,It's good.,Mike
05x19,What are you doing?,Robin
05x19,I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a gn.,Marshall
05x19,You have not been attacked by a monkey?,Lily
05x19,"What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",Marshall
05x19,"Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",Robin
05x19,Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,Marshall
05x19,It's good. I buy a gn.,Lily
05x19,No. I got mugged.,Marshall
05x19,So Bobo goes.,Man
05x19,No! I have not been mugged!,Marshall
05x19,You know if it was attacked?,Barney
05x19,I have no idea.,Ted
05x19,"Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?",Man
05x19,Tell us just what happened.,Lily
05x19,"Yes, tell us the truth.",Robin
05x19,And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.,Ted 
05x19,Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,Marshall
05x19,"And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a wapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.",Ted 
05x19,"Shit. Okay, put a microphone.",Robin
05x19,Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,Ted
05x19,It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,Barney
05x19,"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",Ted
05x19,"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",Barney
05x19,I doubt it.,Ted
05x19,The children you will not believe what happened.,Ted 
05x19,The monkey escaped!,Mike
05x19,It has one of my dolls!,Male 2
05x19,"Bobo, just there, Bobo.",Man
05x19,He climbs the building!,Mike
05x19,"Bobo, come here.",Man
05x19,I'll get it.,Mike
05x19,It's really happening?,Ted
05x19,"Of course, Ted.",Barney
05x19,True story.,Ted 
05x20,"Children, everybody has at least a moment to take a huge decision, a crazy decision that will change their lives forever. This is a story of mine.",Ted 
05x20,"It all started with a visit to my mother and her boyfriend for a long time, Clint, who always said things in the style...",Ted 
05x20,"Ted, your mother is really a woman... really erotic boy.",Clint
05x20,Please do not.,Ted
05x20,"As a painter, slash, composer, slash, voluntary combatant with fear. I find it incredibly... sensual. But you have sx own memories of your mother, right?",Clint
05x20,"Please, stop.",Ted
05x20,"Exciting her nipple, receiving her milk. You follow me?Fine.",Clint
05x20,I can not believe I'm with this man.,Mother
05x20,"Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys...",Ted
05x20,It's so cool! And he chooses!,Mother
05x20,"Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.",Ted
05x20,"Oh, well... because that was an ad to make you... Son.",Clint
05x20,"Yes, my mother was lapping. I married for the second time before I get married once. I was so happy for them.fcking happy. While weddings can be magical. As far as I know, I'll end up dancing with my future wife in this marriage.",Ted 
05x20,"And if you do not boil the jars of jam, it will be a haven for bacteria.",Woman
05x20,It was not her.,Ted 
05x20,"Oh, congratulations!",Lily
05x20,We're so happy for you!,Marshall
05x20,I feel like my 19 years. It is as if the past 35 years had never happened.,Mother
05x20,"I love to listen to you, Mom.",Ted
05x20,"Son, to show you that your mother and I will always be there for you, I want you to have this beautiful picture I have painted.",Clint
05x20,"Children, there was no guitar.",Ted 
05x20,"I'm sorry, Ted.",Clint
05x20,Best...,Robin
05x20,... marriage...,Marshall
05x20,... never...,Lily
05x20,... seen.,Barney
05x20,"Hello everyone. Mahallow to be there with us. Throughout my life, well, this life. I waited a muse as Virginia. Girl... this is your song.",Clint
05x20,Oh my God.,Ted
05x20,"Children, I swear, I remember the 12 minutes following. So I have no idea of the end of the song.",Ted 
05x20,And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.,"Clint, singing"
05x20,"Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
05x20,You're currently whining?,Barney
05x20,"I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Robin
05x20,"Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
05x20,"And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!",Barney
05x20,"Children, I can not exaggerate how horrible it is to be a single guy in his mother's second marriage.",Ted

05x20,You marry when?,Woman
05x20,You marry when?,Woman 2
05x20,You marry when?,Older woman
05x20,"Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!",Barney
05x20,I gotta go.,Ted
05x20,"Wait, Ted. And your speech?",Marshall
05x20,Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.,Ted
05x20,"Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!",Marshall
05x20,"Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.",Barney
05x20,And my friends I have not seen during the next 72 hours.,Ted 
05x20,"Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.",Lily
05x20,I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.,Robin
05x20,Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional.  Shh. Leave it alone.,Barney
05x20,"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.",Robin
05x20,She cried to the song of Clint.,Barney
05x20,"Hi, guys.",Ted
05x20,"Ted, where were you?",Lily
05x20,Is that okay?,Robin
05x20,"Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!",Ted
05x20,"Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?",Marshall
05x20,"Yeah, but where we're going to end?",Lily
05x20,"First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.",Ted
05x20,"Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",Ted
05x20,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Ted, come! Oh, my god!",All
05x20,We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.,Lily
05x20,I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.,Ted
05x20,"I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.",Ted
05x20,Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.,Ted
05x20,"What, are you saying that you bought the house?",Lily
05x20,"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.",Ted
05x20,"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?",Barney
05x20,"Try not to laugh with you that, man.",Marshall
05x20,"So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",Ted
05x20,Whoa.,Robin
05x20,"Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",Lily
05x20,"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.",Ted
05x20,"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?",Barney
05x20,"Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.",Ted
05x20,"Look out, man.",Marshall
05x20,"Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.",Lily
05x20,"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.",Robin
05x20,The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,Barney
05x20,"Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?",Marshall
05x20,Thank you.,Ted
05x20,"Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.",Marshall
05x20,"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",Robin
05x20,"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",Barney
05x20,Children? Why...,Robin
05x20,Put rockets in...,Barney
05x20,"Oh, my God, guys! Great new game: Drunk or child? I was what? Guess.",Marshall
05x20,Bourre.,Lily
05x20,Bourre.,Robin
05x20,Gamin.,Barney
05x20,Gamin.,Ted
05x20,"Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!",Marshall
05x20,"You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.",Barney
05x20,It was not me!,Robin
05x20,What?,Lily
05x20,It's not me who cried during the song Clint.,Robin
05x20,Are you crying?,Robin
05x20,"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Barney
05x20,Not as much as me.,Robin
05x20,I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,Barney
05x20,500? No worries.,Robin
05x20,"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
05x20,"Wait, you're...",Barney
05x20,"Hi, I'm here for inspection.",Man going
05x20,"Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.",Ted
05x20,"Well I'm here for a while, but I think the bell does not work.",Man
05x20,Hmm.,Ted
05x20,"Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.",Man
05x20,"Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?",Barney
05x20,"Well, yeah.",Ted
05x20,Hey! Hey! Hey!,All
05x20,"Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",Marshall
05x20,I was...,Marshall
05x20,Marshall is dead! Marshall died!,Mother
05x20,"A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.",Marshall
05x20,"Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.",Ted
05x20,Hmm... sausage party?,Marshall
05x20,"Burgers, burgers will be made.",Ted
05x20,"Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",Lily
05x20,"Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really shit to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",Ted
05x20,"Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",Marshall
05x20,"Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",Robin
05x20,"Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.",Man
05x20,"You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",Lily
05x20,"You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",Ted
05x20,"I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",Marshall
05x20,"Not so fast.  was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.",Man
05x20,"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",Ted
05x20,"It was Robin! What! Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",Barney
05x20,"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",Robin
05x20,Of course.,Barney
05x20,"I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.",Robin
05x20,"Boy, you've almost had us still.",Lily
05x20,You're always a little too far.,Marshall
05x20,Shit.,Barney
05x20,"Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.",Man
05x20,Really?,Ted
05x20,"Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.",Man
05x20,And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,Ted
05x20,I'll see at the top if all goes well.,Man
05x20,He said he had found a tramp?,Marshall
05x20,"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",Ted
05x20,I see a complaint.,Barney
05x20,Found termites.,Man
05x20,"Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has klled some cockroaches at the time of impact.",Robin
05x20,"Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",Lily
05x20,"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",Ted
05x20,Thank you. My God.,Barney
05x20,Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.,Ted
05x20,"OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.",Barney
05x20,What do you mean?,Ted
05x20,"Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.",Barney
05x20,"Please, stop.",Ted
05x20,"Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.",Barney
05x20,What are you talking about?,Ted
05x20,I wanted to be your father!,Barney
05x20,What does that mean?,Ted
05x20,"Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that bstrd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.",Barney
05x20,And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.,Barney
05x20,Here we go.,Virginia
05x20,It is a good time. Not much traffic...,Barney
05x20,"Oh, I love this song.",Virginia
05x20,Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...,Barney
05x20,Your pen1s is huge.,Virginia
05x20,Again?! One too many!,Marshall
05x20,"Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.",Barney
05x20,"Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.",Robin
05x20,"Okay, this is a Mellencamp.",Barney
05x20,"Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.",Ted
05x20,"Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?",Lily
05x20,It's silly.,Ted
05x20,Your mother and I were at second base.,Barney
05x20,Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.,Ted
05x20,"A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord.",Lily
05x20,There... there is one last thing I should do.,Ted
05x20,And my friends have not seen during the next 72 hours.,Ted 
05x20,It was our turn.,Robin
05x20,Hi.,Ted
05x20,"Ted, what are you doing here?",Virginia
05x20,"I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... I pass. Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you.",Ted
05x20,"Ted... I'm so there... cooked. I'm 60 sure only that you're there before me. But if you're here, I love you. And you're the best son a mother could have.",Virginia
05x20,Hey.,Ted
05x20,"Hey, man.",Marshall
05x20,How did you know that I would be here today?,Ted
05x20,Robin told me. Happy Housewarming!,Marshall
05x20,But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.,Ted
05x20,"I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! You've not heard a single fcking time. Your heart is both drunk and child.",Marshall
05x20,"Please stay here with me, man.",Ted
05x20,That's what I do.,Marshall
05x20,I can... I can give you some ideas I have?,Ted
05x20,Yeah.,Marshall
05x20,"And, children, Marshall was right. I have not given up my dream home because that's the thing with the stupid decisions. It makes them all. But time is funny. And sometimes a little magic. It may take a stupid decision... and turn it into something sensible. For children, as you know, this house... our house is.",Ted 
05x21,"Children, your Aunt Robin was dating Don until recently, but one evening, coming from nowhere...",Ted 
05x21,You want to install?,Don
05x21,"Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think.",Robin
05x21,"I mean, you can install yourself beyond me to sit?",Don
05x21,"Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree.",Robin
05x21,But... now that you've mentioned... you wanna install?,Don
05x21,You said what?,Lily
05x21,I thought about it.,Robin
05x21,"You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.",Barney
05x21,"We have the same job, Barney.",Robin
05x21,"And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.",Barney
05x21,It still seems fast.,Lily
05x21,You're probably right.,Robin
05x21,You should live with him.,Ted
05x21,Really?,Robin
05x21,"Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.",Ted
05x21,You wanna throw me out because of something with milk?,Robin
05x21,It's super boring.,Ted
05x21,Robin?!,Ted
05x21,No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.,Robin
05x21,Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?,Ted
05x21,"All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.",Barney
05x21,"Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.",Robin
05x21,I promise.,Barney
05x21,"I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?",Barney
05x21,It's good.,Don
05x21,And it was Barney.,Robin
05x21,It's not bad.,Don
05x21,"Actually, I'm not sure.",Ted
05x21,I think it's great. But I pity any woman with self-esteem so low it would go out with him.,Don
05x21,Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.,Ted 
05x21,"I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.",Barney
05x21,"There, he knew it.",Ted 
05x21,So Barney's your ex and you hang out with him? It makes me uncomfortable.,Don
05x21,"The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.",Robin
05x21,"In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin.",Barney
05x21,"How was your weekend, or any other topic?",Robin
05x21,Atrocious.,Lily
05x21,Terrible.,Marshall
05x21,Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.,Lily
05x21,"Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.",Marshall
05x21,"Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......",Lily
05x21,Maid!,Voice
05x21,You can come back later? It takes a nap.,Marshall
05x21,It's time to return the keys.,Voice
05x21,We spent 18 hours.,Marshall
05x21,We missed the full board.,Lily
05x21,I lost 5 kg.,Marshall
05x21,It's not weird that Robin is still friends with Barney?,Don
05x21,It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney.,Ted
05x21,I do not know how to react to the fact that she hangs out with an ex.,Don
05x21,Robin had said nothing either to Don about another of his ex. Me.,Ted 
05x21,"Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. Shit, two is even better. Because strawberry...",Ted
05x21,But if you had someone and he hung out with an ex...,Don
05x21,"Wait, sorry. It?",Ted
05x21,He was friends with his ex.,Don
05x21,"Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that?",Ted
05x21,Your teacher of calligraphy called...,Robin
05x21,And?,Ted
05x21,Your ink arrived.,Robin
05x21,Yes.,Ted
05x21,I wanted to ensure that Project Runway is registering. The uniform changed to the Jets?,"Ted, leaving her room"
05x21,I think there will be no creme brulee tonight. My torch to brown is broken.,"Ted, an apron"
05x21,"When I found out that your roommate is single, I was a little jealous, but now that I know he's gay, so good.",Don
05x21,Ted is not...,Robin
05x21,But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.,Ted
05x21,Thank you. Ted is not it?,Don
05x21,Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour.,Robin
05x21,"Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay.",Ted
05x21,"Lily, be honest. It's not weird that Robin train with an ex?",Don
05x21,Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem.,Lily
05x21,Ted? And Robin?,Don
05x21,"I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?",Ted
05x21,An apple martini for gentleman.,Bartender
05x21,Thank you.,Ted
05x21,"You're also out with Ted? 4 people you consider your best friends, you've slept with 50 of them.",Don
05x21,It's just my friends.,Robin
05x21,But they are also your ex. And you live with one of them.I'm sorry. I have to think about all that.,Don
05x21,Her toenails are daggers.,"Lily, thinking"
05x21,"Great! And now he falls asleep. Hello, river of slime.","Lily, thinking"
05x21,My knee itches. I'll just scratch a little.,"Marshall, thinking"
05x21,It should have separate beds.,Lily
05x21,"Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds.",Marshall
05x21,a deal!,Lily
05x21,I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.,Don
05x21,"Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.",Barney
05x21,Not at all.,Don
05x21,That was after you to be part.,Barney
05x21,Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.,Robin
05x21,"I acts as a hysteric. It's not offensive, right?",Don
05x21,Still not gay.,Ted
05x21,"Sorry, I meant you're both important to Robin. How about dinner tomorrow night at home.",Don
05x21,It's great.,Ted
05x21,"I can not wait, buddy.",Barney
05x21,Thank you.,Robin
05x21,You're welcome.,Don
05x21,"So long, guys.",Robin
05x21,I have to get Robin.,Barney
05x21,Are you kidding?,Ted
05x21,"I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.",Barney
05x21,I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.,Ted
05x21,I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while.,Barney
05x21,You ready.,Ted
05x21,Ready for what?,Barney
05x21,To read the letter.,Ted
05x21,"Children, I invented the letter to remind me of the reasons for a breakup. I did it for years.",Ted 
05x21,"Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.",Ted
05x21,"Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who beat you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.",Ted
05x21,"Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.",Ted
05x21,When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...,Ted 
05x21,Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake.,Barney
05x21,Write it.,Ted
05x21,What?,Barney
05x21,Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.,Ted
05x21,My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool.,Barney
05x21,Right?,Ted
05x21,You... and Robin...,Barney
05x21,"... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.",Barney
05x21,Get it?,Ted
05x21,I understand. I really want it back.,Barney
05x21,"Humans are not made to share a bed. sx and sleep are associated, but these are two different things.",Marshall
05x21,"I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only.",Lily
05x21,"Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love.",Marshall
05x21,A bed for sx. For hot sx and bestiality.,Lily
05x21,"Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses.",Marshall
05x21,"Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for sx, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays.",Lily
05x21,"Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage?",Marshall
05x21,And how.,Lily
05x21,Do you like sushi?,Don
05x21,"Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.",Robin
05x21,It's too easy.,Barney
05x21,"Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying Sit wherever you want, except on that chair. You will be so...",Ted
05x21,My chair!,Barney
05x21,From spicy tuna? My favorite.,Lily
05x21,"I do too. It is more spicy, the better.",Don
05x21,"Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad.",Barney
05x21,You will not believe. Don also has twin beds.,Marshall
05x21,We just had.,Lily
05x21,Great. Super.,Don
05x21,Wait. This super does not look great.,Lily
05x21,My ex and I thought it would be a good idea but they separated.,Don
05x21,But I bet you have no special bed sx.,Marshall
05x21,"It yes, with his personal trainer.",Don
05x21,This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.,Barney
05x21,"But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed.",Don
05x21,I would love. If I move.,Robin
05x21,If you moved in.,Don
05x21,Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!,Barney
05x21,Great! Give her milk!,Ted
05x21,"spit, spit!",Robin
05x21,"We have more milk. Thank you for the reminder, Robin.",Don
05x21,"Well, I hope you're happy.",Ted
05x21,I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.,Barney
05x21,You were emptied from the top and bottom.,Ted
05x21,Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.,Barney
05x21,"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.",Ted
05x21,"You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.",Barney
05x21,That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.,Ted
05x21,For my biographer?,Barney
05x21,"Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And shit. I want it back.",Ted
05x21,"So that night, with Barney, we sat down to talk calmly and reasonably to the most deserving Robin.",Ted 
05x21,I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.,Ted
05x21,"... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!",Barney
05x21,"It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.",Ted
05x21,"Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically.",Barney
05x21,Of course.,Ted
05x21,"Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!",Barney
05x21,We all talk!,Ted
05x21,I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.,Lily
05x21,"This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed.",Marshall
05x21,We can at least get closer?,Lily
05x21,"Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not.",Marshall
05x21,Why?,Lily
05x21,"I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam.",Marshall
05x21,You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.,Lily
05x21,"To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.",Marshall
05x21,We're getting closer?,Lily
05x21,You speak of beds yet?,Marshall

05x23,"Stella, your happiness is all that matters to me, except his poor children I care volunteer.",Tony
05x23,I love it.,Royce
05x23,"It's not so easy. Jed Mosley is perhaps not as beautiful as you, or as big...",Stella
05x23,I'm bigger than him.,Ted
05x23,And sx is horrible. Once he fell asleep in the middle.,Stella
05x23,Once. I was on medication!,Ted
05x23,What?,Royce
05x23,Nothing.,Ted
05x23,"This movie is really rotten! And everything is wrong!Remember my request? This spontaneous moment in the game room, I had no ring, so I gave him a teddy?",Ted
05x23,It was cute.,Lily
05x23,And romantic.,Marshall
05x23,A little cutesy.,Robin
05x23,That's how it was in the movie...,Ted
05x23,"If it makes you shut up, I think we can get married.",Jed
05x23,You do not give me the ring?,Stella
05x23,"Bluntly not, doll. You pass it the finger.",Jed
05x23,And the hot date 2 minutes? When I condensed a romantic rendezvous in 2 minutes to go with the busy schedule of Stella?,Ted
05x23,You're a good guy.,Lily
05x23,It was really nice.,Marshall
05x23,And a little cutesy.,Robin
05x23,According to the film...,Ted

05x23,"Bluntly not, doll. Can I suggest a date of 2 minutes, if you know what I mean. Naked!",Jed
05x23,"If you know what you do, 2 minutes.",Marshall
05x23,Word expert.,Lily
05x23,But the worst... the worst... it was the end. They are to marry...,Ted
05x23,"Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?",Priest
05x23,"Tell not the end! This is what I would say, if ever, I wanted to see a movie as bad. Continues.",Marshall
05x23,So they are to marry...,Ted
05x23,Stella!,Tony
05x23,Tony!,Stella
05x23,Tony?,Jed
05x23,"I must say something. Long ago, I left this beautiful daughter, Stella, to escape. And now she is with this jerk who does not appreciate the true value of this beautiful bride.",Tony
05x23,What is your problem?,Ted
05x23,You can not talk to me like that! I'm Ted Mosley!,Jed
05x23,"He said Ted, right?",Ted
05x23,"Stella, I promised you'd be my wife. And I would keep that promise.",Tony
05x23,Everything I wanted in my life was your love.,Stella
05x23,"Go ahead, darling, kiss him.",Priest
05x23,If you still love me... Would you be my bride?,Tony
05x23,"Bluntly, doll.",Stella
05x23,Stop! Dad!,Jed
05x23,"Take that, Ted Mosby!",Children
05x23,"Okay, he really said this time around.",Ted
05x23,"It was too much. I laugh, I cry. This is cinema, but it would not tell real people? It was so real! Why did you say Oh, no early in the film?",Royce
05x23,"This is where I realized that everyone has baggage, including me.",Ted 
05x23,Nothing.,Ted
05x23,You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another.,Lily
05x23,Why? So why should it?,Ted
05x23,Because it is past the fifth most profitable films.,Robin
05x23,I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!,Ted
05x23,He looks like zero.,Lily
05x23,I'll never see him out of friendship for you.,Robin
05x23,"Children, you see more.",Ted 
05x23,She made her choice. Do not worry. I will not come to marriage.,Tony
05x23,You'll come! I'll take you there myself and force you to watch!,Jed
05x23,The code.,Tony
05x23,That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.,Barney
05x23,I was determined to make this film as far from me as possible. Unfortunately...,Ted 
05x23,It was not great the bride?,Royce
05x23,I too loved it!,Woman
05x23,We'll see tomorrow.,Man
05x23,It may come? Want to see it again?,Royce
05x23,"Yeah, that was good.",Ted
05x23,"Good? Rather perfect! The only thing, and for me it is a very small defect, compared to other films, is that I understand why Stella wants to marry a guy like Jed Mosley. Just the name of this guy: Jed Mosley...",Royce
05x23,"Royce, you're out with Jed Mosley, too.",Woman
05x23,"Who has not? It is a sacred number. A butterfly tattoo, how to pronounce this encyclopedia.",Royce
05x23,Encyclopaedie.,Man and woman
05x23,"Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation.",Ted
05x23,"I was so happy that this loser is done let go before the altar. You know why? Because he saw it coming. And the best part is that he will live a long, sad life, knowing he has lost his only chance of happiness. And when he gets beaten up by the goat?",Royce
05x23,Too funny!,Woman
05x23,Bluntly!,Ted
05x23,What a loser!,Royce
05x23,"Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf htler, a new king has arrived!",Ted
05x23,"Ted, you're okay?",Royce
05x23,I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.,Ted
05x23,"It was really bad, you should apologize.",Royce
05x23,Bluntly not Carrment doll... not...,Ted stood up
05x23,"You said not altogether, doll?",Lily
05x23,You really used the phrase Jed Mosley?,Marshall
05x23,I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?,Ted
05x23,I wanted to see Avatar.,Marshall
05x23,It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.,Ted
05x23,"Good luck. This film is international, it's great.",Robin
05x23,Maybe North Korea?,Lily
05x23,"I read that Kim Jong, he says it's his second favorite movie. Just after he made a film where the horse in slow motion.",Robin
05x23,"Sorry, Ted, you're screwed.",Lily
05x23,"No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, Hi, stranger. Can I help you? And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted? Inside you, you're still that guy.",Marshall
05x23,I still am.,Ted
05x23,You wanna go get that girl.,Marshall
05x23,I want to go get that girl.,Ted
05x23,For it is the love of your life.,Marshall
05x23,"Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice.",Ted
05x23,Because she's nice.,Marshall
05x23,"It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.",Ted
05x23,The wedding is in 15 minutes. I'll never make it.,Tony
05x23,You can do Sensei. Give a roundhouse kick to love. Live in the heart.,Child
05x23,You're right. What am I doing? There is still time!,Tony
05x23,"Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?",Priest
05x23,Royce!,Ted
05x23,Ted?,Royce
05x23,Ted?,Barney
05x23,Barney?,Ted
05x23,I must say something.,Tony
05x23,"I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride.",Ted
05x23,What do you mean?,Royce
05x23,You can not talk to me like that!,Jed
05x23,"I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.",Ted
05x23,"To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?",Barney
05x23,What...,Ted
05x23,I wanted... People want to know.,Barney
05x23,They are burgundy in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.,Ted
05x23,All I wanted was some pancakes this week.,Royce
05x23,"Come on, darling, kiss him.",Barney
05x23,Barney did not say kiss. Still not kiss.,Ted 
05x23,You must go!,Man
05x23,This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!,Barney
05x23,"Royce, if you...",Ted
05x23,Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes?,Ted
05x23,"Bluntly, doll.",Royce
05x23,Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.,Barney
05x23,"That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.",Ted
05x23,Let me help you.,Royce
05x23,"And like that, kids, my luggage no longer seemed so heavy. Everyone has his baggage, it's part of life. But like everything else, it's easier when someone helps us.",Ted 
05x23,It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.,Ted
05x23,"It's not that important. Me too, I was let go before the altar. Three times. The last time, because I lost all our money at poker. That's why I live with my brother.",Royce
05x23,"Wait, I thought you had a very small studio.",Ted
05x23,"Just the two of us. You'll see, he still pulls the duvet.",Royce
05x23,"Yeah, you need to go there.",Ted
05x24,"Kids at this moment in history, had been found look-alikes. Lookalikes strange but funky, four of us. Robin There was a lesbian. Marshall... the mustachioed Lily the stripper... and Mexican wrestler myself. Yes, mine was the coolest. And therefore, it was all anxious to find the lookalike fifth, that of Barney. It was more important to some than others.",Ted 
05x24,"We agree, it's insane to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?",Lily
05x24,"Sure, it goes without saying.",Marshall
05x24,"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?",Lily
05x24,Deal.,Marshall
05x24,"And one day, a few weeks later...",Ted 
05x24,You were serious with this story of the fifth lookalike?A baby is big enough to let the universe decide.,Marshall
05x24,"I know, it's crazy. It's easier to let the universe decide. Why?",Lily
05x24,Decided!,Marshall
05x24,Wait 2 seconds! It could easily be Barney who tries to fck chicks.,Lily
05x24,I've moved up.,Marshall
05x24,Barney here.,Barney
05x24,"Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?",Marshall
05x24,"Yes, I'm in the office. This is the sound of my stapler.This is the sound of my trouilloteuse. And that, the sound of me, ranking the company's directive on sexual harassment. What's new? I gotta run, great leader.",Barney
05x24,Barney's office. It was the fifth double.,Marshall
05x24,Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
05x24,"I hasten to add. This is one of the moments you dream about. Friends, Lily and I have unprotected relations. I have chills.",Marshall
05x24,We're going to say anything.,Lily
05x24,What? Why?,Marshall
05x24,"If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives.",Lily
05x24,"You kiss? Go on, I'm not even there. But just like that, have a baby: big mistake. Now, show me.",Barney
05x24,"Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself.",Ted
05x24,"It just happened... is that Marshall Eriksen will say to his wife while trying to impregnate her. Helicopter 12 is live at the scene, with Baby Alert: 2010.","Robin, on TV"
05x24,Okay. I tell anyone.,Marshall
05x24,We saw the fifth lookalike!,Lily
05x24,Incredible!,Robin
05x24,That's great!,Ted
05x24,Bizarre. A Barney Brown.,Robin
05x24,"I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde.",Lily
05x24,True. The blonde does not go to any guy.,Robin
05x24,I'm not sure.,Ted
05x24,What?,Lily
05x24,"This was where I was swimming teacher at Cascade Country Club of Grief, I washed the mop with lemon juice, playing with natural highlights. Let's just say that there were some old pretending to drown. Unfortunately, one has really drowned. In short, blonde suits me.",Ted
05x24,Okay you two. We are in a delicate situation but very promising.,"Marshall, thinking"
05x24,"If we play well the next minute, Ted goes to bleach their hair.","Lily, thinking"
05x24,"This is wicked, can not... I just imagine. How do we do?","Robin, thinking"
05x24,What we all think? Nachos?,"Ted, thinking"
05x24,I know. I really had for lunch.,"Ted, thinking"
05x24,Several people told him not to do something.Follow me.,"Marshall, thinking"
05x24,"I do not care, I can eat. Yes, we would like nachos.",Ted
05x24,"I love you buddy, but it is impossible that the blond you go well.",Marshall
05x24,It would not look good.,Robin
05x24,"Yeah, seriously, Ted, you not discolor hair.",Lily
05x24,I fade hair!,Ted
05x24,It is not at all what we expected!,Marshall
05x24,"The children, Robin and Don became such a duo, both outside and inside the screen, that Channel 12 asked them to lead others of their flagship programs.",Ted 
05x24,"So that's why Monty and I have vowed never to take drugs.Because the drug is bad. Not true, Monty?",Don
05x24,"Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times.",Robin
05x24,"We do not try to Shadow Zone, Monty.",Don
05x24,"I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!",Robin
05x24,So... what do you mean?,Don
05x24,I've tried drugs.,Robin
05x24,Fun Fact: This episode had the highest ratings.,Ted 
05x24,What was that for?,Robin
05x24,"Before you, I had given up everything. Relationships, my career, my pants. You have given me want to try again. I love you for that.",Don
05x24,I see...,Robin
05x24,"Sorry. You do not know me. But I wanted to thank you.In fact, you are someone very important in my life.",Marshall
05x24,"Important? You mean, legendary? Marshall, it's me!",Barney
05x24,"Oddly, this was not the biggest surprise of the day.",Ted 
05x24,"This is rather sudden. Of course, you will have an answer tomorrow. Okay. Thank you.  You know what, it can wait.","Robin, on the phone"
05x24,"No, go ahead. I'm listening.",Ted
05x24,"The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week.",Robin
05x24,That's great!,Ted
05x24,"Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is...",Robin
05x24,"Helen, dryer stops!",Ted
05x24,Is Chicago.,Robin
05x24,"You're the fifth double. How can you be you? I called you, Barney. And we talked about!",Marshall
05x24,"Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.",Barney
05x24,"To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief.",Barney
05x24,"It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job.",Marshall
05x24,"Come, Grand Chief.",Barney
05x24,Come on. Stops.,Marshall
05x24,Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love.,Robin
05x24,"Endless Battle? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.",Ted
05x24,I'm lost. What do I do?,Robin
05x24,You really need to talk to Don.,Ted
05x24,I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want.,Robin
05x24,"It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.",Ted
05x24,You did a manicure?,Robin
05x24,"No, I did not...",Ted
05x24,It makes a.,Woman
05x24,Why are you brown taxi driver?,Marshall
05x24,"Oh, that. You know how I dream of making love to a woman from each country?",Barney
05x24,Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.,Marshall
05x24,I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in 180 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations.,Barney
05x24,It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.,Barney
05x24,The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it.,Barney
05x24,I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.,Marshall
05x24,What's the problem?,Barney
05x24,"Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children.",Marshall
05x24,Children!? No! Rule: no children under 45! You never read my blog!? He has improved a lot.,Barney
05x24,"I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years.",Marshall
05x24,"Sorry, pal. It'll be  37.50.",Barney
05x24,"That night, Marshall returned to the news to Lily.",Ted 
05x24,"The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby.",Lily
05x24,"They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a marriage. Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?",Barney
05x24,"First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.",Ted
05x24,It gets no compliments.,Robin
05x24,The other thing.,Ted
05x24,It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.,Robin
05x24,"Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh?",Marshall
05x24,"But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself.",Lily
05x24,I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.,Marshall
05x24,I know what's bothering you.,Lily
05x24,Really?,Marshall
05x24,The taxi driver looked like enough to Barney.,Lily
05x24,"Well, there you got wrong.",Marshall
05x24,Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.,Barney
05x24,I think Robin...,Ted
05x24,"Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.",Barney
05x24,It was smaller than Barney!,Lily
05x24,It was the same size!,Marshall
05x24,"And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly.",Lily
05x24,You forgot what looks like Barney?,Marshall
05x24,You kiss?,Barney
05x24,Why are you in our room?  Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?,Marshall
05x24,It works!,Ted
05x24,Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has forgotten to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.,Barney
05x24,"What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?",Lily
05x24,"By omission, because this idea of let the world decide is crazy.",Marshall
05x24,"Baby, you...",Lily
05x24,We must control our...,Marshall
05x24,Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.,Barney
05x24,"Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say.",Ted
05x24,It failed him.,Robin
05x24,The other thing.,Ted
05x24,He had a manicure.,Robin
05x24,The other thing.,Ted
05x24,I had a job offer in Chicago.,Robin
05x24,That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...,Barney
05x24,"Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.",Robin
05x24,I can not believe that Robin is going to lose.,Ted
05x24,"Perhaps it's the depression talking, but Ted's hair beginning to be well?","Lily, thinking"
05x24,"Thank God, I thought I was the only one!","Marshall, thinking"
05x24,Looks like a real movie star!,Barney
05x24,"And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.",Ted
05x24,Finally.,Lily
05x24,I told you so.,Marshall
05x24,Not so great that.,Barney
05x24,So I was on the phone with Chicago.,Robin
05x24,"Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you.",Robin
05x24,I'm staying.,Robin
05x24,"Tell me... Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied.",Marshall
05x24,"I know. It's weird, huh?",Lily
05x24,It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.,Marshall
05x24,Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?,Robin
05x24,You'll never believe it. I was offered the position of presenter WNKW in Chicago.,Don
05x24,You said what?,Robin
05x24,I agreed. It's been years I expect this opportunity.,Don
05x24,Barney?,Marshall
05x24,I'm single mountebank of Estonia. Who is this Barney?,Sosie
05x24,It's just a guy we know who has a blog and really bad.,Marshall
05x24,"It seems that he is improving. Finally, what is it, blog?",Sosia
05x24,This is something that was cool 8 years ago.,Marshall
05x24,Always cool. It looks pretty cool.,Sosia
05x24,What's your name?,Lily
05x24,Kristof.,Sosia
05x24,how Kristof?,Lily
05x24,Kristof... Sosie.,Sosia
05x24,Really? Your last name is Sosie?,Marshall
05x24,"It's my name, man.",Lookalike
05x24,Wait. Trying to understand.,Don
05x24,I'm going.,Robin
05x24,Wait. Put yourself in my place. You can imagine what it is to be offered a dream job?,Don
05x24,"I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.",Robin
05x24,"Barney, why are you doing this?",Lily
05x24,Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?,Marshall
05x24,Who is Barney? Calm down the U.S.!,Sosia
05x24,Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.,Lily
05x24,I'd be interested to read what he has to say in his blog.,Sosie
05x24,"But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.",Lily
05x24,Babies... this can be cute.,Sosia
05x24,"And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.",Lily
05x24,Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.,Woman
05x24,Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!,Barney
05x24,And I'm like you clown.,Woman
05x24,Say yes to that.,Robin
05x24,Yes.,Ted
05x24,I can re-move?  Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?,Robin
05x24,"Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.",Ted
05x24,Seems like I become more and more stupid.,Robin
05x24,"Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The Robin, there was 5 years? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great.  We drank a lot.",Ted
05x24,I do not care.,Robin
05x24,"What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.",Ted
05x24,"And here's how my hair bleached prevented us from doing anything that would have regretted. Children, the world is fun.",Ted 
05x24,Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!,Lily
05x24,"Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.",Barney
05x24,"The friends, follow me!  Look! The fifth double.",Lily
05x24,This guy looks like me...,Barney
05x24,Guys... Play the game,Marshall
05x24,"Children, you can ask the universe all the signs of the world...",Ted 
05x24,It's amazing.,Marshall
05x24,Is not it?,Lily
05x24,It looks like Barney.,Robin
05x24,Amazing.,Ted
05x24,It's like looking in a mirror.,Barney
05x24,"But ultimately, we see only what we want to see, when you're ready to see it.",Ted 
05x24,Does that mean...?,Marshall
05x24,Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
06x01,"Kids, there are two big days in any love story: the day you meet the girl of your dreams, and the day you marry her.",Ted from 2030
06x01,Nice! Where'd you get this?,Ted
06x01,Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you.,Marshall
06x01,"And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.",Ted
06x01,"Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous?",Marshall
06x01,What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?,Ted
06x01,"Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous.",Marshall
06x01,"Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.",Ted
06x01,"I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?",Barney
06x01,A sun dress.,Ted
06x01,"Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?",Barney
06x01,I really have to get this done.,Ted
06x01,"Of course, of course.",Barney
06x01,Thank you.,Ted
06x01,"Sun dress, by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...",Barney
06x01,"Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!",Ted
06x01,I want to see a pretty girl.,Barney
06x01,"Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.",Ted
06x01,"I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word.",Barney
06x01,And what's that word?,Ted
06x01,Dibs!,Barney
06x01,What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.,Ted
06x01,You never called dibs.,Barney
06x01,Dibs were implied.,Ted
06x01,Implied dibs?,Barney
06x01,Yeah.,Ted
06x01,"Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...",Barney
06x01,"Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.",Ted
06x01,And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!,Barney
06x01,Damn it!,Ted
06x01,Where is Marshall anyway?,Barney
06x01,Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat.,Ted from 2030
06x01,"Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles?",Marshall
06x01,Check.,Lily
06x01,Music to set the mood?,Marshall
06x01,Check.,Lily
06x01,Music for when we're actually doing it?,Marshall
06x01,Check.,Lily
06x01,You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.,Ted
06x01,"Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this: When I step up to make my toast as your best man...",Barney
06x01,"Actually, Marshall would probably be...",Ted
06x01,As your best man...,Barney
06x01,Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs.,Barney
06x01,No!,Ted
06x01,What?,Barney
06x01,Tell me this isn't true.,Ted's wife
06x01,I had implied dibs.,Ted
06x01,I had no idea. You have to know that.,Ted's wife
06x01,"Shhh, shh. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.",Barney
06x01,"Or, you know, we could just do it right here.",Ted's wife
06x01,We could just do it right here.,Barney
06x01,Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.,Ted
06x01,"Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny. That is not what shields up looks like.  That is what shields up looks like.",Barney
06x01,"Move. God!  Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?",Robin
06x01,"Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace.",Barney
06x01,No fries for this guy.,Robin
06x01,"Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.",Barney
06x01,"You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.",Ted
06x01,With hygiene?,Barney
06x01,"No, with Don. A few months earlier...",Ted from 2030
06x01,"Here, have some tea.",Ted
06x01,Thanks.,Robin
06x01,"Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.",Ted
06x01,"Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no.",Robin
06x01,Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.,Ted
06x01,"Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out.",Robin
06x01,"Okay, I'm ready to have sx now.",Robin
06x01,"It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?",Ted
06x01,"No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.",Robin
06x01,"Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you.",Barney
06x01,"Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?",Ted
06x01,"Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know?",Robin
06x01,This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a de-rection.,Barney
06x01,Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?,Ted
06x01,Nope!,Marshall
06x01,"Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall.",Lily
06x01,"Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall!",Marshall
06x01,"Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived.",Lily
06x01,"Yeah, it did.",Marshall
06x01,"No, no. It's a real package from your dad.",Lily
06x01,"Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.",Marshall
06x01,"Marshall, look!",Lily
06x01,"A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily?",Marshall
06x01,You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?,Lily
06x01,Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.,Marshall
06x01,Ohhh,Barney
06x01,"We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.",Marshall
06x01,"I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself.",Lily
06x01,"I feel you, buddy.",Ted
06x01,"Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously.  Okay, I'm better now.",Marshall
06x01,"Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?",Ted
06x01,Excuse me?,Barney
06x01,Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.,Ted
06x01,Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.,Barney
06x01,20 bucks.,Ted
06x01,But I... Can I go smell her first?,Barney
06x01,No.,Ted
06x01,Fine.,Barney
06x01,All right. Wish me luck.,Ted
06x01,"Now kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy?  FLASHBACK - Cindy's appartment  How I went on one date with her and it ended...",Ted from 2030
06x01,Get out.,Cindy
06x01,badly? Well...  END OF FLASHACK,Ted from 2030
06x01,How are you?,The Girl who was reading
06x01,Good.,Cindy
06x01,What the hell are you doing?,Barney
06x01,That girl she's talking to? I dated her.,Ted
06x01,"Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",Barney
06x01,"So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?",Robin
06x01,"Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?",Robin
06x01,"Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of... But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle?",Ted from 2030
06x01,I got to see her ankles.,Ted
06x01,"You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...",Robin
06x01,"Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?",Marshall
06x01,Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?,Lily
06x01,Shannon? Start the music...,Marshall
06x01,"I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.",Marshall
06x01,"Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...",Lily
06x01,Hello.,Lily
06x01,"Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I noticed you hadn't changed your last name yet.",Marshall's dad
06x01,"No, I'm gonna...",Lilly
06x01,"So, don't worry. I called the DMV, I called your Amex, I got that process started for you.",Marshall's dad
06x01,Hello.,Lily
06x01,"Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I understand you and Marshall have been fighting. Well, let me tell you what works for me and the missus. Frilly French undies and a box of wine.",Marshall's dad
06x01,Hello.,Lily
06x01,You might want to try pickles on that sandwich.,Marshall's dad
06x01,Pickles would have helped that sandwich!,Marshall
06x01,The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions!,Lily
06x01,"Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.",Marshall
06x01,"So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.",Lily
06x01,"Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?",Marshall
06x01,Only if you want to give this a stroke.,Lily
06x01,"That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!",Marshall
06x01,They're talking to a guy now.,Robin
06x01,What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?,Ted
06x01,"Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.",Robin
06x01,"Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.",Ted
06x01,"Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?",Robin
06x01,"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.",Barney
06x01,Jealous?,Robin
06x01,"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",Barney
06x01,I have not lost it.,Robin
06x01,You lost it.,Barney
06x01,"I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",Robin
06x01,"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",Barney
06x01,I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,Robin
06x01,"Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?",Marshall
06x01,That's about the size of it.,Lilly
06x01,"Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?",Marshall
06x01,We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,Lily
06x01,"So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.",Marshall
06x01,Out for three months?,Lily
06x01,Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,Marshall
06x01,"No, we didn't.",Lily
06x01,"I meant, me and my dad.",Marshall
06x01,"You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",Lily
06x01,"Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",Marshall
06x01,What?,Lily
06x01,I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,Marshall
06x01,Ted?,Cindy
06x01,"Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?",Ted
06x01,"Hi, Ted!",Cindy
06x01,"Yeah, she definitely saw you.",Barney
06x01,Can I see you for a minute... in private?,Cindy
06x01,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",Ted
06x01,"Okay, will do. And dibs.",Barney
06x01,"Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",Lily
06x01,"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",Barney
06x01,Why not?,Lily
06x01,"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",Barney
06x01,That was really...,Lily
06x01,"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",Barney
06x01,Brief.,Lily
06x01,"No. Lily, look.  You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.",Barney
06x01,Hi.,The man
06x01,"14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",Robin
06x01,"Robin, you do look super hot.",Barney
06x01,"Oh, do I?",Robin
06x01,"Yeah, you do.",Barney
06x01,Thanks.,Robin
06x01,"I braced myself for what was next: rage, fury, a possible shanking.",Ted from 2030
06x01,"Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or...",Cindy
06x01,"Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",Ted
06x01,"No, it wouldn't.",Cindy
06x01,"It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",Ted
06x01,I should get back.,Cindy
06x01,Totally.,Ted
06x01,Come say good-bye before you leave.,Cindy
06x01,Say good-bye before you leave?,Robin
06x01,Her words exactly.,Ted
06x01,"Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",Barney
06x01,"She didn't see us high-six, did she?",Ted
06x01,No. Good. That was pretty lame.,Barney
06x01,"Yeah, let's never do that again.",Ted
06x01,Marshall?,Lily
06x01,"What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",Marshall
06x01,Here's the thing.,Lily
06x01,"I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.",Marshall
06x01,"Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go?",Marvin
06x01,"Dad, this is...",Marshall
06x01,Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back?,Marvin
06x01,"Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.",Marshall
06x01,Did it feel like a boy? You can tell.,Marvin
06x01,"He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",Marshall
06x01,"You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",Lily
06x01,"Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",Marshall
06x01,What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,Lily
06x01,"Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",Marshall
06x01,I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,Ted
06x01,"Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did.",Ted from 2030
06x01,"Like I said, she's here on a date.",Robin
06x01,So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.,Ted from 2030
06x01,"Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.",Ted
06x01,"Dude, it's just a wedding toast.",Marshall
06x01,"I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.",Ted
06x01,It will be.,Marshall
06x01,Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
06x01,"Geez, what now?",Ted
06x01,"Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.",Marshall
06x01,Yeah. You were saying?,Ted
06x01,"You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",Marshall
06x01,No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,Ted
06x01,"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?",Marshall
06x01,No! Of course! Absolutely!,Ted
06x02,"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",Barney
06x02,What's wrong?,Robin
06x02,I don't want to talk about it.,Barney
06x02,"Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?",Robin
06x02,Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,Ted
06x02,"All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",Barney
06x02,"That sucks. I've been there, buddy.",Ted
06x02,What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.,Marshall
06x02,"With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric sx temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",Ted
06x02,"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.",Barney
06x02,You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,Lily
06x02,Of course not. It's a two-day job.,Barney
06x02,Pass.,Robin
06x02,Same.,Ted
06x02,Unsubscribe.,Marshall
06x02,"You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",Barney
06x02,No one believes that story.,Ted
06x02,"You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.",Lily
06x02,How did he do that?,Lily
06x02,So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.,Ted from 2030
06x02,"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",Barney
06x02,"Yeah, that's what your mom said.",Ted
06x02,How dare you!,Barney
06x02,"No, she actually said that.",Ted
06x02,"Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there.",Lauretta
06x02,"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?",James
06x02,James!,Everyone
06x02,Bro!,Barney
06x02,How you doing?,Ted
06x02,Hey!,James
06x02,"Oh, my goodness!",Lauretta
06x02,Mama.,James
06x02,Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.,Lauretta
06x02,Mom. Stop.,Barney
06x02,"And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?",Lauretta
06x02,"Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?",James
06x02,Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,Barney
06x02,"So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",Robin
06x02,Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,Ted
06x02,"Oh, you know, how funny you are...",Robin
06x02,Guilty.,Ted
06x02,Handsome.,Robin
06x02,"Who, me?",Ted
06x02,Incredible lover.,Robin
06x02,Really?,Ted
06x02,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours... Blah, blah, blah. Orgasms so intense that you just black out. All that stuff.",Robin
06x02,"Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",Ted
06x02,"What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",Robin
06x02,"But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, It's the greatest movie ever. You say, Uh, it's pretty good And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, Sweep the leg! And Daniel-san's all like...",Ted
06x02,Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,Robin
06x02,Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.,James
06x02,"Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",Lily
06x02,"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
06x02,"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
06x02,That sounds plausible.,Marshall
06x02,"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",Barney
06x02,"Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.",James
06x02,"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",Barney
06x02,"Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.",Barney
06x02,Thank you.,Barney
06x02,Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,Marshall
06x02,"Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",James
06x02,Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,Barney
06x02,"Oh, I don't know... That guy.",Loretta
06x02,"Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",Robin
06x02,"No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.",James
06x02,Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,Barney
06x02,Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,Ted
06x02,"Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was sick and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",Lily
06x02,"I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4 in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",Marshall
06x02,And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,Lily
06x02,"Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",Marshall
06x02,I always find that reassuring.,Ted
06x02,"You will meet her, buddy.",Marshall
06x02,You think so?,Ted
06x02,Yeah!,Marshall
06x02,"Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",Lily
06x02,"Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",Marshall
06x02,Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,Lily
06x02,"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.",Marshall
06x02,I'm not lying to our kids.,Lily
06x02,Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,Barney
06x02,"Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",James
06x02,"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",Barney
06x02,No idea. Why?,James
06x02,Mom addressed this and never sent it.,Barney
06x02,What's in it?,James
06x02,"Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... Your son.",Barney
06x02,"Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",Loretta
06x02,"Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?",James
06x02,That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?,Loretta
06x02,There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote your son on the back.,James
06x02,"Oh, no, that... It says Yourson. For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?",Loretta
06x02,"If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?",James
06x02,"I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!",Loretta
06x02,Can you believe her?,James
06x02,"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",Barney
06x02,"So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",Robin
06x02,How?,Ted
06x02,"I sent her another email. Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.",Robin
06x02,Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,Ted
06x02,"Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.",Robin
06x02,"See, now you went too far in the other...",Ted
06x02,I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.,Robin
06x02,Stop!,Ted
06x02,"Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",James
06x02,"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",Barney
06x02,"Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.",James
06x02,"I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",Marshall
06x02,Not now.,Lily
06x02,"This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",James
06x02,"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",Barney
06x02,You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.,James
06x02,Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,Marshall
06x02,"Oh, what's done is done.",Lily
06x02,Ted Mosby is solid as a rock. No. Dependable. No. Rugged. No.,Ted
06x02,Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?,Robin
06x02,I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,Ted
06x02,"How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control. Oh, damn.",Robin
06x02,What?,Ted
06x02,That last bump just made me hit send.,Robin
06x02,"Oh, no.",Ted
06x02,Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.,Robin
06x02,"No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. Everyone?",Ted
06x02,Really rich?,Barney
06x02,You ready for this?,James
06x02,"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",Barney
06x02,I thought you said that he... Stop.,James
06x02,"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",Barney
06x02,Come here.,James
06x02,Can I help you?,Sam Gibbs
06x02,Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs.,James
06x02,Yes.,Sam Gibbs
06x02,"I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s.",James
06x02,"Loretta! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Loretta.",Sam
06x02,My mother meant to send you this.,James
06x02,You're my son.,Sam
06x02,"God, this must be so hard for Barney.",Lily
06x02,"Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...",Marshall
06x02,"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",Barney
06x02,"That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.",James
06x02,"Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.",Sam
06x02,"Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",Ted
06x02,He's also quite the detective.,Robin
06x02,Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,Lily
06x02,"Or, he could just let him have this one.",Marshall
06x02,What?,Ted
06x02,Are you kidding?,Lily
06x02,"Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",Marshall
06x02,"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",Barney
06x02,"I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",Ted
06x02,"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",Barney
06x02,"During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common.",Ted from 2030
06x02,Come on. You know this. Come on.,Sam
06x02,There you go. Come on.,Sam
06x02,Weird day.,Robin
06x02,Weird day.,Ted
06x02,"Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",Robin
06x02,I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,Ted
06x02,Maybe a little.,Robin
06x02,You said she was a ten.,Ted
06x02,I did not specify on what scale.,Robin
06x02,You said she looked like a movie star.,Ted
06x02,"She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",Robin
06x02,"Dad, look how fast I can run!",Barney
06x02,"He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son.",James
06x02,I have a grandson?,Sam
06x02,His name's Eli.,James
06x02,He's beautiful.,Sam
06x02,"Dad, you're not looking!",Barney
06x02,"Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart.",Ted from 2030
06x02,Barney? I need to talk to you.,Loretta
06x02,"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",Barney
06x02,"Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.",Loretta
06x02,Are you sure?,Barney
06x02,"Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.",Loretta
06x02,"And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before.",Ted from 2030
06x02,"I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible.",Basketball coatch
06x02,"What'd Coach say, Ma?",Barney
06x02,He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.,Loretta
06x02,Why didn't anyone come?,Barney
06x02,"Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.",Loretta
06x02,Barney.,Loretta
06x02,"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.",Barney
06x02,But it's your father.,Loretta
06x02,I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,Barney
06x02,"Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom.",Ted from 2030
06x02,Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?,Barney
06x03,"Kids, in my early days of being a professor, I had one simple goal: give a lecture that changes someone's life. Then one afternoon in 2010, I achieved that goal.",Ted from 2030
06x03,"Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is unfinished. Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...",Ted
06x03,"But first, let's back up a few days.",Ted from 2030
06x03,"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?",Barney
06x03,I don't know. Got a burger coming.,Ted
06x03,"Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.",Marshall
06x03,"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.",Barney
06x03,Hi. Barney Stinson.,Barney
06x03,"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.",Marshall
06x03,Thank you for your time.,Barney
06x03,Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,Barney
06x03,"So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast.",Robin
06x03,"And now, the 11:00 News with Don Frank.",TV Speaker
06x03,"Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?",Ted
06x03,"Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure.",Robin
06x03,That's great. Good for you.,Ted
06x03,"Yeah, thank you.",Robin
06x03,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,Excuse me?,Robin
06x03,"When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,I don't know what you're talking about.,Robin
06x03,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,There's no poop.,Robin
06x03,Where's the poop?,Lily
06x03,Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.,Robin
06x03,"Hey, Don, here's some breaking news: there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that.",Robin
06x03,"Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.",Robin
06x03,That's great.,Ted
06x03,Thank you.,Robin
06x03,"Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,"Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.",Robin
06x03,"I am gonna kll you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kll you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the klling and eating your face thing.",Robin
06x03,Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.,Lily
06x03,Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.,Robin
06x03,Prove it. Delete contact.,Lily
06x03,There. Deleted.,Robin
06x03,"Back already. How was flying solo? And by solo, I mean so low that you got shot down.",Marshall
06x03,"Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.",Barney
06x03,"Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?",Lily
06x03,"Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that sx just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have sx with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her.",Barney
06x03,"The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor.",Ted from 2030
06x03,"What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.",Ted
06x03,"No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?",Barney
06x03,It's my building.,Ted
06x03,"Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.",Ted from 2030
06x03,"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?",Barney
06x03,Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,Ted
06x03,"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",Barney
06x03,"This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.",Marshall
06x03,"Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.",Ted
06x03,No? Are you kidding me?,Robin
06x03,But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.,Lily
06x03,"I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.",Ted
06x03,"Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bllet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",Marshall
06x03,"For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",Ted
06x03,"But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",Marshall
06x03,"Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",Ted
06x03,"I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",Ted
06x03,Of course not.,Barney
06x03,All right.,Ted
06x03,And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...,Ted from 2030
06x03,"I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",Ted
06x03,I need another drink.,Barney
06x03,"Marshall, you want anything?",Ted
06x03,"No, I'm fine.",Marshall
06x03,"Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",Ted
06x03,"Wait, you turned down the job? When?",Marshall
06x03,This morning.,Ted
06x03,"That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",Marshall
06x03,"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",Marshall
06x03,Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,Barney
06x03,Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,Ted
06x03,"Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",Marshall
06x03,"Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",Ted
06x03,"I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",Marshall
06x03,"I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",Ted
06x03,"Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",Marshall
06x03,"Chrissy, I love your glasses.",Barney
06x03,Really?,Chrissy
06x03,They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,Barney
06x03,The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,Marshall
06x03,But Barney hasn't done...,Ted
06x03,"Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",Barney
06x03,"Hey, Lily!",Robin
06x03,"Don't Hey, Lily me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",Lily
06x03,"Oh, no, not this again.",Robin
06x03,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,"Okay, I left Don another message.",Robin
06x03,This just in is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.,Robin
06x03,But that's impossible. You deleted his number.,Lily
06x03,"I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, Are you sure? And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",Robin
06x03,"Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",Lily
06x03,"It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",Robin
06x03,"I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",Lily
06x03,"Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",Robin
06x03,"My plezh. If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",Lily
06x03,Super Kicks Karate.,Robin
06x03,"No, not that one. That's my dojo.",Lily
06x03,You have a dojo?,Robin
06x03,I took an introductory karate class.,Lily
06x03,"Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",Lily
06x03,"What's the matter, lady? You scared?",Boy
06x03,Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,Lily
06x03,I hated kindergarten. All three times.,Boy
06x03,But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,Lily
06x03,How long ago did you take that class?,Robin
06x03,"I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, Wassuuuuuuup!",Lily
06x03,"How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",Robin
06x03,I might.,Lily
06x03,"No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",Robin
06x03,"No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",Lily
06x03,I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,Ted
06x03,"For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",Robin
06x03,No! Barney's been putting the moves on Ted.,Marshall
06x03,"Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",Lily
06x03,"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",Marshall
06x03,Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,Robin
06x03,"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks!  Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",Barney
06x03,He did.,Ted
06x03,And the intense eye contact thing?,Robin
06x03,"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",Barney
06x03,Okay. Yep.,Ted
06x03,And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,Robin
06x03,You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,Ted
06x03,That is so true.,Barney
06x03,Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,Ted
06x03,"So at any point in this did you say, Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job?",Robin
06x03,"Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",Ted
06x03,You're loving this.,Lily
06x03,No.,Ted
06x03,You are. You're loving the attention.,Lily
06x03,"It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",Ted
06x03,"Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",Robin
06x03,I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,Ted
06x03,Robin never deleted Don's number.,Lily
06x03,"Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",Robin
06x03,"Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",Marshall
06x03,Edwin.,Robin
06x03,"Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",Marshall
06x03,You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,Robin
06x03,"No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",Marshall
06x03,"Probably not, baby.",Lily
06x03,"See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",Robin
06x03,"Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",Marshall
06x03,"Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",Robin
06x03,Okay. Your turn.,Lily
06x03,"Barney, I gotta tell you something.",Ted
06x03,"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",Barney
06x03,Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,Ted
06x03,"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",Barney
06x03,"Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more. It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, Oh, God, I never should have said no.",Ted
06x03,"It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",Marshall
06x03,"Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",Ted
06x03,"It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",Marshall
06x03,I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,Ted
06x03,"Okay, I'll do it!",Ted
06x03,"What? Ted, it's too late.",Barney
06x03,I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,Ted
06x03,"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",Barney
06x03,"Okay, it's a move.",Marshall
06x03,What?,Ted
06x03,Dude!,Barney
06x03,"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",Marshall
06x03,You guys lied to me?,Ted
06x03,You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,Barney
06x03,I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,Marshall
06x03,"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",Ted
06x03,We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,Barney
06x03,"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",Ted
06x03,236.,Barney
06x03,"...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",Ted
06x03,"No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",Marshall
06x03,"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",Barney
06x03,"No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",Ted
06x03,"Hey, guys.",Robin
06x03,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,"How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",Robin
06x03,I think that's just called a dog.,Marshall
06x03,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x03,Fine. I called Don again.,Robin
06x03,"Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kll you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",Robin
06x03,I thought you deleted his number.,Lily
06x03,"I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",Robin
06x03,"Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",Lily
06x03,"I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",Robin
06x03,"Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",Ted
06x03,"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",Ted
06x03,Why aren't you in class?,Rachel
06x03,"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",Barney
06x03,Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,Ted
06x03,And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away...,Ted from 2030
06x03,"And now, the 11:00 News with Don Frank.",TV Speaker
06x03,Bueno?,Voice
06x03,Who is this?,Robin
06x03,No hablo ingles. Quien es?,Voice
06x03,"I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.",Robin
06x03,"Robin finally got some closure, too.",Ted from 2030
06x03,Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.,Robin
06x03,"Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.",Lily
06x03,I knew this day would come.,Man
06x04,I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.,Barney
06x04,Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.,Ted
06x04,"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.",Barney
06x04,Aw... That's actually really sweet.,Lily
06x04,"Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",Barney
06x04,"Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!",Everyone
06x04,That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.,Lily
06x04,"Hey, get this. You know my friend Max from law school? He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown, and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over. He wants us to come check it out.",Marsall
06x04,"I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.",Robin
06x04,"What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker and never have seen Woody Allen?",Marsall
06x04,I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.,Robin
06x04,"Kids, you know talk show host Maury Povich. It was uncanny how often we saw this guy.",Ted from 2030
06x04,"Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.",Lily
06x04,"Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen.",Marsall
06x04,"I am, too, a real New Yorker.",Robin
06x04,That's adorable. You're from Canada.,Ted
06x04,I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.,Robin
06x04,"A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.",Lily
06x04,I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.,Ted
06x04,"No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.",Lily
06x04,"No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've klled a cockroach with your bare hands.",Marshall
06x04,"Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.",Robin
06x04,"By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things.",Ted from 2030
06x04,"Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?",Barney
06x04,"Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.",Marshall
06x04,Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.,Barney
06x04,"Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes.",Robin
06x04,"A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.",Lily
06x04,"Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.",Ted
06x04,"The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.",Barney
06x04,"Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't beat the bus!",Ted
06x04,I can beat a bus or a cab or a train!,Marshall
06x04,Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?,Robin
06x04,"Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.",Marshall
06x04,"You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.",Barney
06x04,How?,Marshall
06x04,"Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?",Barney
06x04,"Oh, my God!",Lily
06x04,"Oh, wow!",Barney
06x04,"All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! Doesn't matter how you get there!",Ted
06x04,Stay sad! I'll be back!,Barney
06x04,"Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.",Barney
06x04,"Kids, I should tell you, Lily really needed a win that day.",Ted from 2030
06x04,"When Marshall and Lily decided to have a baby, they assumed it would happen right away.",Ted from 2030
06x04,"It's gonna be positive. Eriksen man are hella fertile. When Uncle Morris was 16, he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight in the backseat of a car. Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.",Marshall
06x04,Negative.,Lily
06x04,"As the weeks went by, Marshall's confidence never wavered. Then it started to mess with Lily's head.",Ted from 2030
06x04,"Negative? Well, we know it's not me.",Marshall
06x04,Everything's fine. These things take time.,Lily
06x04,"Not with an Eriksen. Something must be wrong with you. Also, my mom hates you.",Marshall
06x04,"You know what? Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again.",Lily
06x04,"What? No, you wouldn't. Somebody help me! Somebody help me!",Marshall
06x04,"Lily was so fed up with not getting anywhere, maybe winning this race was just what she needed.",Ted from 2030
06x04,Idiot!,Man
06x04,I'll show them. My body can outrun any motorized vehicle. I'm like John Henry when he beat the steam engine. All I need is a great folk song.,Marshall
06x04,"Gather round, ye children to hear the tale so sweet of a man who dared to race machines with nothing but his feet",Folk singer
06x04,"Suck it, grand-butt!",Marshall
06x04,Marshall versus the machines,Folk singer

06x04,Track maintenance? 20-minute delay?,Lily
06x04,How do you do that?,Man
06x04,"I grew up here, I speak conductor. Damn it!  Damn it!",Lily
06x04,"Kids, I also needed a win that day. A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called...",Ted from 2030
06x04,"A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called...",Ted from 2030
06x04,Grademyteacher.net?,Ted
06x04,"It's this awesome site where students can go say what they really think about their professors. Hey, you're probably on there.",Marshall
06x04,I just had to see what my students had written about me. And it was... Majestic. Until...,Ted from 2030
06x04,"Now, kids, I knew I was a good Professor. That's why I didn't let it bother me. I had nothing to prove. Absolutely nothing.",Ted from 2030
06x04,Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there?,Ted
06x04,Oh. The brown one or the gray one?,Man
06x04,That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...,Ted
06x04,Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!,Barney
06x04,Somebody call an ambulance!,Waiter
06x04,"Excuse me, I've got a thing.",Robin
06x04,Hey! That's my cab!,Woman
06x04,"Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.",Robin
06x04,This is my cab...!,Woman
06x04,"Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.",Barney
06x04,"Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown.",Medic
06x04,"Oh, no.  It's Barney. Help me.",Barney
06x04,Robin also needed a win that day.,Ted from 2030
06x04,"It had been a rough year for Robin. First her boyfriend and former cohost, Don, left her for another job. Then Robin met her new cohost, Becky.",Ted from 2030
06x04,Hi! I'm Becky!,Becky
06x04,Hi.,Robin
06x04,I am so excited to be your coanchor! Yay!,Becky
06x04,"Hi, Becky. My, you're perky.",Robin
06x04,"Don't worry, I am not here to step on your toesies.",Becky
06x04,Oh...,Robin
06x04,You're still the star. I made chocolate chip cookies for everybody! Yay!,Becky
06x04,"And just like that, Becky started to eclipse Robin. I mean, literally eclipse her.",Ted from 2030
06x04,This is my cab! Aah!,Woman
06x04,Keep it.,Robin
06x04,Hello.,Ranjit
06x04,"Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.",Barney
06x04,Taking you to Gregor's.,Ranjit
06x04,As Marshall ran with all his might and passed his friend Christine,Folk singer
06x04,"Hey, Christine.",Marshall
06x04,He thought of all the times that he had beaten the machine. He triumphed over Pitfall He vanquished the alarm. He brought the jukebox back to life with his Fonzarelli arm Marshall versus the machines.,Folk singer
06x04,Last seat. Thank God. I just had the worst cab ride of my life.,Woman
06x04,"Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896.",Ted
06x04,"Hey, Ranjit, pull over.",Barney
06x04,Pulling over.,Ranjit
06x04,"Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.",Barney
06x04,Hyah! Move along. Hyah! Move along. Hyah!,Folk singer
06x04,See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be...,Ted
06x04,"So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?",Robin
06x04,I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?,Barney
06x04,Are you kidding me?,Robin
06x04,"Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?",Robin
06x04,Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.,Barney
06x04,"Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...",Robin
06x04,"Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.",Barney
06x04,"What, you really had something to talk about?",Barney
06x04,"Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me klled. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.",Robin
06x04,"Robin, I had no idea.",Barney
06x04,"No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car.",Robin
06x04,Stopping the car.,Ranjit
06x04,"No, don't stop the car.",Barney
06x04,Not stopping the car.,Ranjit
06x04,"Seriously, stop the car.",Robin

06x04,Carrots and peas.,Robin
06x04,Don't... You...,Barney
06x04,I'll crank up the smooth jazz.,Ranjit
06x04,Our hero's strength was fading fast just as the light turned... green. He then thought back to all the times he'd lost to a machine. The cable box is fearsome but the stapler's mighty sting... The cable box's bite again... Getting too tired to sing.,Folk singer
06x04,Uses a hybrid steel tube structure...,Ted
06x04,"Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization. If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus...It's you.  The good news is, I was halfway there, and nothing could stop me.",Ted from 2030
06x04,Whoa! This is crazy.,Marshall
06x04,I can't believe it.,Robin
06x04,"Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.",Ted
06x04,"Just like that, the race was back on.",Ted from 2030
06x04,Idiot.,Maury Povich
06x04,"Meanwhile, one subway car over...",Ted from 2030
06x04,"Oh, God. Oh, bite me!",Robin
06x04,Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.,Barney
06x04,"And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.",Barney
06x04,"Actually, Barney did not need a win.",Ted from 2030
06x04,"And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.",Barney
06x04,He did smell incredible.,Ted from 2030
06x04,Stop! Too slow. Switch.,Barney
06x04,Sweetie? Are you okay?,Lily
06x04,No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over.,Robin
06x04,"You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.",Lily
06x04,What did he say?,Robin
06x04,"No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?",Lily
06x04,Hey! Lily.,Robin
06x04,"Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker.  Hey, it's Lily. Help me.",Lily
06x04,"And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?",Ted
06x04,"Buddy? Hey, buddy? Need a hand?","Man, in a calculator display"
06x04,The machines have won! he machines have won.,Marshall
06x04,"Dude, mellow.",Man
06x04,I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I... I can't... I can't get my wife pregnant!,Marshall
06x04,Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?,Ted
06x04,"My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.",Marshall
06x04,"Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.",Ted
06x04,"Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.",Marshall
06x04,64. But whatever.,Ted
06x04,"And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.",Marshall
06x04,"Sounds like you guys need to clear everything, subtract the negativity, and add some perspective.",Man
06x04,"Marshall! Marshall, get in!",Lily
06x04,Hello.,Ranjit
06x04,There it is.,Ted
06x04,Where are Marshall and lily?,Robin

06x04,I can't believe I won!,Robin

06x04,Run him over.,Lily
06x04,Running him over.,Ranjit
06x04,"No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?",Marshall
06x04,Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.,Lily
06x04,"Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.",Marshall
06x04,Why did I get so crazy about this?,Lily
06x04,"Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.",Marshall
06x04,"Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.",Lily
06x04,I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.,Marshall
06x04,It's only been two months.,Lily
06x04,We are crazy.,Marshall
06x04,We're totally crazy.,Lily
06x04,This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?,Marshall
06x04,We gotta go back to Paris.,Lily
06x04,And take ballroom dancing.,Marshall
06x04,And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.,Lily
06x04,"And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids.",Marshall
06x04,"Oh, a cradle list.",Lily
06x04,"I'm... So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race.",Marshall
06x04,It isn't a race.,Lily
06x04,"Ranjit, screw Gregor's. Let's go to Coney Island.",Marshall
06x04,Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island.,Ranjit
06x04,"As for how Robin beat me and Barney, to this day, your uncle Barney won't admit it... Who cares? But here's what I saw: I saw Barney notice Robin's face... And maybe realize something. Barney says he tripped, but it sure felt like he tackled me on purpose. And when Robin won, I could have sworn I saw him smile.",Ted from 2030
06x04,I won!,Robin
06x04,No!,Barney
06x04,"So I said, the cab, of course",Robin
06x04,I know what you did back there.,Ted
06x04,"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.",Barney
06x04,I'm not gonna... Not gonna...,Ted
06x04,Smell me.,Barney
06x04,He did smell incredible.,Ted from 2030
06x04,"Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen?",Robin
06x04,He's right there.,Max
06x04,"Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.",Robin
06x04,I always get those two confused.,Max
06x04,"Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term... A real New Yorker.",Ted from 2030
06x05,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, which meant working side by side with your Uncle Barney.",Ted from 2030
06x05,"I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.",Ted
06x05,Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!,Barney
06x05,"Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said...",Ted from 2030
06x05,"Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.",Barney
06x05,"It was the site of The Arcadian, one of New York's grandest old hotels. In its heyday, it was the New York home to kings and queens. But lately... mostly just queens.",Ted from 2030
06x05,"Hi, handsome. Lookin' for a date?",trnsvstite
06x05,"Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.",Ted
06x05,"Barney, we have to talk.",Ted
06x05,Sure. What's up?,Barney
06x05,"Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.",Barney
06x05,"Not now, Trish!",Barney
06x05,But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.,Barney
06x05,Dary.,Ted
06x05,"Legendary! So, what's on your mind?",Barney
06x05,I can't design the building.,Ted
06x05,"Oh, yeah.",Marshall
06x05,"Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.",Lily
06x05,"Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction.",Marshall
06x05,Traction?,Lily
06x05,"As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm.",Marshall
06x05,Please stop calling yourself Papa.,Lily
06x05,"And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats.",Marshall
06x05,"Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.",Lily
06x05,"Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school... with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off.",Ted from 2030
06x05,Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.,Marshall
06x05,"Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small pen1s, but they want to double-date next weekend.",Lily
06x05,Why would you tell me that?,Marshall
06x05,So you'll clear your schedule.,Lily
06x05,No! The other part!,Marshall
06x05,"Oh, the small pen1s thing?",Lily
06x05,Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him Max.,Marshall
06x05,"That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small pen1s...",Lily
06x05,Just don't!,Marshall
06x05,You're kidding me.,Barney
06x05,"I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?",Ted
06x05,Snakes.,Barney
06x05,Did you just say snakes?,Ted
06x05,"I don't recall saying snakes. Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.",Barney
06x05,New is always better?,Ted
06x05,You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.,Barney
06x05,Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,Ted
06x05,Everything.,Barney
06x05,"So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",Ted
06x05,Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.,Barney
06x05,"And when you're at a gns n' Roses concert, you're like, Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy?",Ted
06x05,"Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.",Barney
06x05,Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?,Ted
06x05,"Glenmckenna, aged 30 years in oak casks.",Wendy
06x05,Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?,Ted
06x05,Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin.,Wendy
06x05,"Your call, buddy.",Ted
06x05,"A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!",Barney
06x05,"Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. Hey, look how big my cell phone is! You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.",Marshall
06x05,Lily told you.,Robin
06x05,Told him what?,Ted
06x05,Max has a small pen1s.,Lily
06x05,How can you speak of such things?,Barney
06x05,Girls talk about everything.,Robin
06x05,"Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...",Lily
06x05,"Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...",Robin
06x05,How can you speak of such things?,Barney
06x05,"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, Boobs? Not the complete sentence, Does she have big boobs? Which also would not be great. Just: Boobs?",Lily
06x05,I do not do that.,Barney
06x05,My friend Lori from work...,Lily
06x05,Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,Barney
06x05,"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.",Lily
06x05,Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,Marshall
06x05,"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",Barney
06x05,I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,Ted
06x05,"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",Barney
06x05,Duh. Of course there's a girl.,Robin
06x05,What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,Ted
06x05,Boobs?,Barney
06x05,"Beautiful building, right?",Woman
06x05,"Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...",Ted
06x05,I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.,Woman
06x05,"Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...",Ted
06x05,"Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...",Woman
06x05,She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,Ted
06x05,Whose dream?,Barney
06x05,We wound up talking for hours.,Ted
06x05,I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.,Woman
06x05,Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.,Ted
06x05,"Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.",Woman
06x05,You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.,Ted
06x05,You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.,Woman
06x05,"Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",Ted
06x05,"That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a trnny before, but it's still sweet.",Woman
06x05,"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.",Barney
06x05,"Hey, Ted, can I ask you something",Woman
06x05,Anything.,Ted
06x05,Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?,Woman
06x05,And you said...?,Barney
06x05,Where do I sign?,Ted
06x05,"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",Barney
06x05,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
06x05,"And what did this Zoey say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",Barney
06x05,Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,Marshall
06x05,"Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",Ted
06x05,"So what do you do, Ted?",Zoey
06x05,I'm a veterinarian.,Ted
06x05,What? I panicked!,Ted
06x05,This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,Barney
06x05,I don't do that.,Ted
06x05,"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies!  ... Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel!  ...   Look, she's really hot, okay?",Ted
06x05,Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,Ted
06x05,Asian girls love them some Jews.,Barney
06x05,And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,Ted
06x05,"Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",Lily
06x05,And you're welcome.,Marshall
06x05,"The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",Ted
06x05,"No. Technically, they were eggs.",Barney
06x05,Did you just say eggs?,Ted
06x05,I don't recall saying eggs.,Barney
06x05,"So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, Holy crap, I'm about to quit",Max
06x05,"Small pen1s. You have a small pen1s. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small pen1s. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than small or pen1s. Got it: small pen1s. Damn it!","Marshall, thinking"
06x05,"Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.",Robin
06x05,"Well, right now it's a pretty small practice.",Max
06x05,"Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",Marshall
06x05,"Bro, it's... pretty small.",Max
06x05,"Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? The motion of the ocean. That whole thing.",Marshall
06x05,"He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",Robin
06x05,I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,Marshall
06x05,"Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff.",Max
06x05,Let's order!,Robin
06x05,As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...,Ted from 2030
06x05,Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.,Ted
06x05,...the strangest thing happened.,Ted from 2030
06x05,I need your help.  Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.,Zoey
06x05,Wasn't expecting bunnies.,Ted
06x05,"I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.",Zoey
06x05,Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,Ted
06x05,"Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge.",Max
06x05,"Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.",Marshall
06x05,"Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right.",Max
06x05,Totally.,Robin
06x05,We'll just be here. You're great.,Marshall
06x05,"Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh.... it's going on a while.",Max
06x05,I know.,Marshall
06x05,Thanks.,Max
06x05,"Damn, baby, be cool!",Lily
06x05,You're acting like he has six months to live.,Robin
06x05,It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!,Marshall
06x05,"Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",Robin
06x05,Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,Marshall
06x05,It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,Marshall
06x05,Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about sx?,Lily
06x05,"Yes, we do, but you know what we say? I hit that.I got some.I tapped it. I squeezed those. Discreet and efficient.",Marshall
06x05,Not to mention classy.,Robin
06x05,"Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our sx life, I'd probably kll myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",Marshall
06x05,"Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",Lily
06x05,Are you sure?,Marshall
06x05,Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,Robin
06x05,You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?,Ted
06x05,Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.,Zoey
06x05,Wow. You're a little bit crazy.,Ted
06x05,"Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.",Zoey
06x05,"Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...",Ted
06x05,"Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.",Zoey
06x05,"Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!",Barney
06x05,"Solid C-cup, perky bounce.",Ted
06x05,Momentary grudging respect.,Barney
06x05,"Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",Ted
06x05,"Ted, that is never gonna happen.",Barney
06x05,"Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.",Ted
06x05,"Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana.",Zoey
06x05,"Oh, bummer!",Man
06x05,Hey.,Ted
06x05,"Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.",Zoey
06x05,"Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with Save The Arcadian.",Ted
06x05,"Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want GNB puts the douche in fiduciary.....or It's always 4:20 somewhere? Dudes, you forgot your signs!",Zoey
06x05,"As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving.",Ted from 2030
06x05,"Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB?",Zoey
06x05,"Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?",Man
06x05,"She was really hot, okay?",Ted
06x05,How the hell could you do that?,Ted
06x05,Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,Barney
06x05,"The billboard, Barney.",Ted
06x05,"I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",Barney
06x05,You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,Ted
06x05,"Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",Barney
06x05,"Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!",Ted
06x05,Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,Barney
06x05,You named the rabbit?,Ted
06x05,"You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.",Barney
06x05,You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,Ted
06x05,So you're back in?,Barney
06x05,Yeah.,Ted
06x05,"That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems... Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision.",Ted from 2030
06x05,"Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.",Lily
06x05,"Uh, it looks disgusting.",Robin
06x05,"Uh, is this working for you?",Marshall
06x05,"Uh, is this working for you?",Lily
06x05,"Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?",Robin
06x05,"Oh, you're bad.",Lily
06x05,More Cosmos?,Robin
06x05,I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!,Marshall
06x05,"Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.",Lily
06x05,"Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",Marshall
06x05,"Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.",Zoey
06x05,"Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",Ted
06x05,"Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...",Ted from 2030
06x05,Are you married?,Ted
06x05,"Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?",Zoey
06x05,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
06x05,"Yeah, it was about the girl.",Ted
06x05,"Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?",Zoey
06x05,"This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",Ted
06x05,Snakes?,Zoey
06x05,I don't recall saying snakes.,Ted
06x05,"Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, I can't do this, and storms out.",Lily
06x05,"Wow, that is weird.",Robin
06x05,But here's the crazier part.,Lily
06x05,No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!,Marshall
06x05,"It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.",Lily
06x05,"Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?",Robin
06x05,"Yup. 'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the... I can't read that, baby.",Lily
06x05,Musky scent of man.,Marshall
06x05,As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.,Lily
06x05,That sounds real.,Robin
06x05,"And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again.",Ted from 2030
06x05,"Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!",Zoey
06x05,"Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again.",Ted from 2030
06x05,How's it going with Robin?,Marshall
06x05,"Uh, I think I have to break up with her.",Max
06x05,Really? Why? You with her?,Marshall
06x05,"Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom.",Max
06x05,"Hey, what's not for everyone?",Ted
06x05,"Guys, come on. What is it?",Marshall
06x05,"Come on, bro. This is a locker room.",Max
06x05,"I... What do you think it was, Murray?",Marshall
06x06,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, our friends Stuart and Claudia had a baby, and Marshall and Lily were the first to visit the happy new parents.",Ted from 2030
06x06,"So, have you guys landed on a name yet?",Marshall
06x06,"We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like Tiffany.",Stuart
06x06,And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.,Claudia
06x06,That's my mother's name.,Stuart
06x06,I know.,Claudia
06x06,"Oh, I got it. How 'bout we name the baby after you-- Frigid Shrew.",Stuart
06x06,"Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her Vodka. Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!",Claudia
06x06,Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.,Stuart
06x06,"Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?",Marshall
06x06,"Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...",Lily
06x06,Emily.,Marshall
06x06,Lisa.,Lily
06x06,Lisa?!,Marshall
06x06,Emily?!,Lily
06x06,Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top: number one...,Marshall
06x06,"I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid LeBron, and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.",Ted
06x06,"Then I'm also crossing off, um, Shaquille... Mm-hmm. Hakeem, and Dikembe. Hey, what about Rob?",Marshall
06x06,Rob? No.,Lily
06x06,Why not?,Marshall
06x06,"Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?",Lily
06x06,"Honka, honka!",Rob
06x06,Not Rob.,Lily
06x06,"um, how about Ryan?",Marshall
06x06,Ooh.,Ted
06x06,Not Ryan.,Lily
06x06,Johnny?,Marshall
06x06,"Hey, where's the goldfish?",Lily
06x06,Not Johnny. Or Gil.,Lily
06x06,Jeremy.,Marshall
06x06,"Jeremy, no!",Lily
06x06,Definitely not Jeremy. His stuff was so derivative.,Lily
06x06,"Well, I mean, geez, Lily.",Marshall
06x06,"Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby Becky, right?",Robin
06x06,Why? What?,Marshall
06x06,Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?,Robin
06x06,"Oh, honey, I really try.",Lily
06x06,Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.,Marshall
06x06,"I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how awful Becky is, so last night I checked it out.",Ted
06x06,"Peace talks in the region have been described as, productive. Becky?",Robin
06x06,": Last night, in Staten Island, a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint. Aww... That's so sad.",Becky
06x06,"Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...",Robin
06x06,"Oh, no! They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat! Who would do that?",Becky
06x06,"Well, if you read the story, we might find out.",Robin
06x06,"Oh, can I do this one, about the horse? I love horseys. Mm-hmm. Aww, the horse died. Guys! This news is all really sad.",Becky
06x06,"Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?",Robin
06x06,Mmm...  I thought she was charming.,Ted
06x06,"You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?",Robin
06x06,You want the long version or the short version?,Barney
06x06,Short version.,Lily
06x06,Short version. Who's your daddy?,Barney
06x06,"You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.",Lily
06x06,"No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?",Marshall
06x06,"Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.",Robin
06x06,"No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.",Marshall
06x06,Wow. That is disgusting.,Ted
06x06,"Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.",Robin
06x06,Challenge accepted.,Barney
06x06,No.,Robin
06x06,"I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.",Barney
06x06,Okay. Here's my list of baby names.,Lily
06x06,Oh.,Marshall
06x06,What about Tara?,Lily
06x06,"No. Not Tara. Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.",Marshall
06x06,We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.,Marshall
06x06,"Tara, your booty is so smooth; And I hope this isn't rude; But I want to get up on it.","Marshall and his friends, singing"
06x06,Not Tara.,Marshall
06x06,What about Esther?,Lily
06x06,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Coming up on the main stage, give it up for Esther!",Announcer
06x06,"Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.",Marshall
06x06,"Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.",Barney
06x06,Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!,Marshall
06x06,That was my card!,Barney
06x06,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Give it up for Esther!",Announcer
06x06,Not Esther. I need a drink. Ted? Ted?,Marshall
06x06,"Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50 chance of you having a daughter, right?",Ted
06x06,"Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?",Marshall
06x06,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. On the main stage, give it up for Marshall's daughter.",Announcer
06x06,"I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God.",Marshall
06x06,"Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.",Marshall's daughter
06x06,"Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie.  Who's your daddy?",Barney
06x06,"You are, 'cause of all the sx we have.",Marshall's daughter
06x06,I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.,Marshall
06x06,"It's not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
06x06,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Marshall
06x06,Marshall? Is that you?,Judy
06x06,"Oh, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit?",Marshall
06x06,How's this?,Marvin
06x06,"Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect.",Marshall
06x06,"What's up, shooter?",Marvin
06x06,"Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys.",Marshall
06x06,"Oh, well, that was just dumb luck. Hey, honey, would you get me a brewski from out of the shed?",Marvin
06x06,"Sure. You want anything, Marshall?",Judy
06x06,"I'm in a computer, Mom.",Marshall
06x06,Oh.,Judy
06x06,"Yeah, all boys. Total co-winky-dink. It was no co-winky-dink. Since the Viking age, the Eriksen men have passed down ancient secrets for conceiving boys. Number one, avoid lemons. They're baby girl fertilizer.",Marvin
06x06,"Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--",Marshall
06x06,I doubt there's any scientific data to support.. I had all sons. Your grandfather had all sons. Your great-grandfather had all sons. Scoreboard! Who you gonna listen to? Me? Or scientific data?,Marvin
06x06,Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?,Robin
06x06,Ask me what I did yesterday.,Becky
06x06,"Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.",Robin
06x06,"Lighten up, Robin. : What'd you do, sweetheart?",Becky
06x06,Mike!,Robin
06x06,"Well, I'm new in town and don't know many people. But yesterday, I met the sweetest man, who took me on a tour of the city.  Guys, New York is kind of cool.",Becky
06x06,"Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic.",Robin
06x06,"Then this cutie patootie took me to this bar called MacLaren's, right underneath his apartment.",Becky
06x06,Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?,Robin
06x06,"Yes! Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate. I saw her bedroom.  She's a messy Bessie.",Becky
06x06,"In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.",Robin
06x06,Ow!,Ted
06x06,"Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?",Robin
06x06,"Not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
06x06,"Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?",Robin
06x06,It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.,Ted
06x06,"I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.",Becky
06x06,Aww...,Ted
06x06,A spider!,Becky
06x06,"Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.",Robin
06x06,I don't know if that's totally true.,Ted
06x06,"It's okay, little darlin'.",Ted
06x06,Poor spider.,Becky
06x06,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.",Ted
06x06,"Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.",Ted
06x06,Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?,Robin
06x06,"Yeah, I slept.",Ted
06x06,I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,Barney
06x06,Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!,Barney
06x06,"Mm, I just need two seconds, baby.",Marshall
06x06,"I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time.",Lily
06x06,"No, um... I'll be right back.",Marshall
06x06,"Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that, to sire a son, you must do three things right before you lay with your maiden. First, eat pickled herring. Eat it!",Marvin
06x06,This is ridiculous.,Marshall
06x06,"Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away, give it up for Marshall's daughter!",ANNOUNCER
06x06,"I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.",Barney
06x06,"Yeah, we don't care about this...",Robin
06x06,"No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.",Ted
06x06,I'm sorry.,Barney
06x06,"Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.",Man
06x06,Challenge accept...,Barney
06x06,"Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.",Ted
06x06,"Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.",Robin
06x06,"For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.",Ted
06x06,Needed?  She makes training wheels feel needed.,Robin
06x06,"Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.",Ted
06x06,Son... Viking lore tells us that to ensure the continuation of your noble male lineage... get a big old bowl of ice and dunk your man sack right in there!,Marvin
06x06,You two and your football.,Judy
06x06,Okay.  Mm-hmm.,Marshall
06x06,"Now get in there, point Lily due north and make me a grandson! Eriksen!",Marvin
06x06,Eriksen!,Marshall
06x06,"When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?",Robin
06x06,Come on! You always took charge of everything.,Ted
06x06,I got this.,Robin
06x06,Thanks.,Ted
06x06,This okay? Am I hurting y...,Ted
06x06,I got this. Whoa!,Robin
06x06,Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.,Ted
06x06,I got this.,Robin
06x06,Did that really bother you?,Robin
06x06,"Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.",Ted
06x06,I got this.,Robin
06x06,Yeah.,Ted
06x06,Let's make a baby!,Marshall
06x06,"Whoa! Baby, you're packing snowballs, and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.",Lily
06x06,"Loving the dirty talk-- but you know what's even hotter? If we face this-a-way. Ooh, we're bad.",Marshall
06x06,"Wait... hey, baby, why are you facing me north? You're trying to make us have a boy.",Lily
06x06,"I... can ex... How do you know about the north thing? Um, um... And what are you doing with those lemons?",Marshall
06x06,Baby girl fertilizer!,Marvin
06x06,You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl.,Marshall
06x06,"All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees.  Ooh... ah... Oh, that's not bad.",Lily
06x06,"Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one.",Marshall
06x06,See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys.,Lily
06x06,"Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl? Or twin girls, who speak... : in unison.",Marshall
06x06,"Oh, well, what about Chucky?",Lily
06x06,"Okay, A  He was a doll; B  He was possessed by an adult serial kller; and C  How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?",Marshall
06x06,Hey.,Robin
06x06,Hey.,Barney
06x06,"Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?",Robin
06x06,"No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.",Barney
06x06,"That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.",Robin
06x06,"Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say Who's your daddy? to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.",Barney
06x06,"Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?",Robin
06x06,Someone naughty left his toys on the floor and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.,Woman
06x06,": Uh-oh, I'm in twubble.",Barney
06x06,You did it? How?,Woman
06x06,"Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go.",Barney
06x06,"Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some?",Woman
06x06,No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.,Barney
06x06,Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy?,Woman
06x06,"Challenge completed!  Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.",Barney
06x06,I got this.,Robin
06x06,"Oh, so you finally agreed on a name?",Lily
06x06,"Uh, well,vthe other night she ran a really high fever.",Claudia
06x06,"We rushed her to the emergency room at 3:00 in the morning, but they wouldn't admit her without a name. Right then and there, we realized how stupid we were being.",Stuart
06x06,"We looked at each other and, well, we just knew. Our baby's name is... Esther.",Claudia
06x06,Esther? That's beautiful.,Marshall
06x06,We're idiots.,Lily
06x06,"Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--",Marshall
06x06,Whoa.,Lily
06x06,Ten-pound? Eight-pound?,Marshall
06x06,"I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my vg1n can't cash.",Lily
06x06,I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.,Marshall
06x06,"Me, too.",Lily
06x06,"You know what? We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy. Like, um...",Marshall
06x06,Jamie.,Marshall  Lily
06x06,Marshall... we just named our baby. Jamie.,Lily
06x06,Not Jamie.,Lily
06x06,"Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over.",Ted
06x07,"And so, due to one architectural oversight, the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906 claimed the lives of 75 people. Now, I hate to stop while I'm on a roll, but happy Halloween, ya crazies!",Ted
06x07,"Hey, Professor Brosby, you gonna come get beers with us later?",Student  1
06x07,"Nah, I got a thing. But you kids have fun trick or treating. This is a treat.",Ted
06x07,"You're the coolest, Professor Mosby. Well, hot dog.",Student  2
06x07,Did it hurt?,Lily
06x07,What?,Ted
06x07,Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.,Lily
06x07,"It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.",Ted
06x07,"Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam.",Barney
06x07,"Hey, guys.",Randy
06x07,"Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer?",Marshall
06x07,"Oh, no, thank you. I brew my own. At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic.",Randy
06x07,I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.,Barney
06x07,"Hey, it just occurred to me, is your friend, what's her name? Garbin, Flabin...",Randy
06x07,Robin?,Ted
06x07,"Robin. That's it, yeah. Is she gonna be here? Oh, not that I really care.",Randy
06x07,Robin has another party to go to.,Lily
06x07,No! Damn it! I'm leaving.,Randy
06x07,But she might stop by later.,Lily
06x07,"I guess I can hang out a little longer. So, anyone going to see the Halloween parade?",Randy
06x07,"Oh, we were big fans of New York's annual Halloween parade. I don't mean the one that takes place Halloween night in the Village. I mean the one that takes place the morning of November 1st, the Annual Post Halloween Walk of Shame Parade.",Ted from 2030
06x07,"Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.",Marshall
06x07,Looks like that bee got busy.,Barney
06x07,Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed.,Ted
06x07,"Oh, looks like Pocahontas has a couple of wounded knees.",Marshall
06x07,"Come on, Marshall.",Ted
06x07,That's a line.,Barney
06x07,"No, it's because of the...",Marshall
06x07,We get it.,Ted
06x07,Does it get any better than this?,Barney
06x07,"Uh, yes.  Yes, it does.",Ted
06x07,Crap.,Robin
06x07,There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.,Barney
06x07,"So, who's the lucky patient?",Lily
06x07,I don't want to talk about it.,Robin
06x07,Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.,Ted
06x07,My co-anchor's a woman.,Robin
06x07,Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.,Barney
06x07,"Robin had always believed that the key to success was intelligence, hard work and professionalism. Her new co-anchor Becky had a different philosophy.",Ted from 2030
06x07,Boats! Boats! Boats!,Becky
06x07,"It's the Farhampton Boat Show! Remember 5th, 6th and 7th at the Farhampton Civic Center. Come on down.",Announcer
06x07,B-B-B-Boats!,Becky
06x07,You did a commercial?,Robin
06x07,Why not?,Becky
06x07,You're a journalist! Don't you want to be taken seriously?,Robin
06x07,No. I'm cute.,Becky
06x07,"Okay, well, if you really think this is going to help your image.",Robin
06x07,"Hi, Becky. Boats, boats, boats! Robin, a little help here?",Mike
06x07,"Robin, you gotta not worry so much about being liked.",Ted
06x07,"Oh, easy for you to say. Everybody loves you at your job.",Robin
06x07,"That was true of my teaching job. But I was also designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, and well...",Ted from 2030
06x07,"Ted Mosby, we don't like you! What do you have to say for yourself, tearing down a beautiful, old building just to put up a stupid band headquarters?",Zoey
06x07,Hmm... Boo... freakin'... hoo.,Ted
06x07,Boo freakin' hoo? That's it? The Arcadian is an architecturally significant...,Zoey
06x07,"Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great.",Ted
06x07,Shampoo. You should try it sometime.,Zoey
06x07,You don't know the first thing about architecture.,Ted
06x07,Key - Ted Mosby's car. Go on.,Zoey
06x07,"I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn.",Ted
06x07,"Oh, good, the eggs are here.",Zoey
06x07,"Well, I should head up.",Ted
06x07,"No, GNB was not popular. That's why every year they produced a feel-good video to improve the bank's image.",Ted from 2030
06x07,"What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care.",GNB announcer
06x07,I care about our precious Earth.,Barney
06x07,I care about old people.,Randy
06x07,"I care about high-yield offshore investments. And so does Tugboat here. Isn't that right, Tugboat?",Man
06x07,"Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.",Marshall
06x07,All you have to do is say I care about making dreams come true.,Barney
06x07,"First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.",Marshall
06x07,Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.,Barney
06x07,"I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice.",Randy
06x07,"Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?",Marshall
06x07,I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that?,Randy
06x07,They never arrived at the downtown office.,Marshall
06x07,"They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is send them downtown not an expression for shredding a document?",Randy
06x07,You shredded them?!,Marshall
06x07,"Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.",Randy
06x07,That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!,Marshall
06x07,"Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.",Randy
06x07,I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.,Barney
06x07,"Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...",Marshall
06x07,"Oh, whoa, you're wearing a green tie now. I'm wearing a green tie.",Arthur
06x07,"GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period.",Marshall
06x07,"Uh, just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project.",Randy
06x07,Period.,Marshall
06x07,Just tell me who you slept with!,Lily
06x07,"Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay?",Robin
06x07,"Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name.",Lily
06x07,Fine. It's Bill Pepper.,Robin
06x07,Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know!,Lily
06x07,"So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?",Ted
06x07,Yes. How do you sleep at night?,Zoey
06x07,What are you doing here?,Ted
06x07,"It was recently made clear to me that I don't know the first thing about architecture, so here I am.",Zoey
06x07,"Very well, then, let's get started.  Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...",Ted
06x07,Ooh! Ooh! Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?,Zoey
06x07,No.,Ted
06x07,What's The Arcadian?,Student
06x07,"Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down.",Zoey
06x07,"What?! No, Professor Mosby loves old buildings. He wouldn't do that. Right, Ted?",Student
06x07,Getting back to Greek Revival...,Ted
06x07,I lost them.,Ted
06x07,"Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley...",Lily
06x07,Johnny? Johnny!,Lily
06x07,He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?,Lily
06x07,We're familiar with it.,Ted
06x07,"Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...",Lily
06x07,Shuts them right up.,Lily
06x07,"Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.",Ted
06x07,"Oh, baby, what's wrong?",Lily
06x07,Something bad happened.,Marshall
06x07,"Randy, hey, have you seen the...",Marshall
06x07,"Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on... Voilagrave;!",Randy
06x07,That's the Hermanson contract?,Marshall
06x07,"The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No...  Anyway, what's your thing?",Randy
06x07,I need the Filbert contract!,Marshall
06x07,"Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.",Randy
06x07,"Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.",Marshall
06x07,"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",Barney
06x07,You slept with Randy!,Lily
06x07,What?!,Robin
06x07,"Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.",Lily
06x07,"Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, Boats! Boats! Boats! So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.",Lily
06x07,"Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.",Robin
06x07,"Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.",Randy
06x07,That's...exactly what happened.,Robin
06x07,"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",Barney
06x07,"Randy, hey, what's going on?",Marshall
06x07,I just wanted to say no hard feelings.,Randy
06x07,Thank you. So where you headed now?,Marshall
06x07,Downtown.,Randy
06x07,No!!,Marshall
06x07,"It's okay, baby.",Lily
06x07,It wasn't okay. So the next morning...,Ted from 2030
06x07,"Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.",Marshall
06x07,That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.,Arthur
06x07,"No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say GNB Cares, and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",Marshall
06x07,"No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.",Arthur
06x07,Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.,Marshall
06x07,"Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...",Arthur
06x07,"No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.",Marshall
06x07,"I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.",Arthur
06x07,"Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?",Ted
06x07,"A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was Boo freakin' hoo?",Student
06x07,Boo... freakin'...,Ted
06x07,I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.,Zoey
06x07,"The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?",Ted
06x07,Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?,Zoey
06x07,No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.,Ted
06x07,"They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell.",Ted from 2030
06x07,And did it work?,Lily
06x07,"Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",Ted
06x07,"Hey, guys.",Randy
06x07,"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy mrderd him.",Barney
06x07,No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.,Lily
06x07,Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?,Randy
06x07,"I'm trying to eat here, buddy.",Ted
06x07,No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.,Lily
06x07,"What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.",Randy
06x07,You didn't sleep with her?,Lily
06x07,"No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.",Randy
06x07,So why are you smiling?,Lily
06x07,I'll tell you why.,Randy
06x07,This just isn't working out.,Marshall
06x07,"I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life.","Randy, thinking"
06x07,"Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.",Randy
06x07,"Randy, great news! You're not fired!",Marshall
06x07,No...!,"Randy, wailing"
06x07,"Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?",Ted
06x07,"Hello, Professor. Ha-boom.",Zoey
06x07,"I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.",Marshall
06x07,But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!,Randy
06x07,"Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.",Marshall
06x07,I-I can't. I need my severance check.,Randy
06x07,"Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.",Marshall
06x07,It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.,Randy
06x07,"Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...",Marshall
06x07,"Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.",Randy
06x07,"Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Green tie?  Nice choice.","Arthur, entering the room"
06x07,Thanks. It brings out my eyes.,Randy
06x07,Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.,Arthur
06x07,"Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.",Marshall
06x07,"Oh, we'll see about that.",Randy
06x07,"Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. We care about making dreams come true, in three, two...",Barney
06x07,No!,Randy
06x07,What are you doing?,Marshall
06x07,"Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.",Randy
06x07,"No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.",Marshall
06x07,And there's more.,Randy
06x07,"I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.",Marshall
06x07,Now am I fired?,Randy
06x07,I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,Marshall
06x07,"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",Barney
06x07,"Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.",Marshall
06x07,"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.",Barney
06x07,That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,Marshall
06x07,"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",Barney
06x07,Hello.,Lily
06x07,It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?,Ted
06x07,"You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...",Lily
06x07,I like my teachers.,Ted
06x07,"...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.",Lily
06x07,Was there more to that story?,Ted
06x07,A little bit.,Lily
06x07,"Lily, you're a psychopath.",Ted
06x07,"A little bit. Oh, a panda!",Lily
06x07,I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try.,Ted from 2030
06x07,"Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?",Zoey
06x07,Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an F.,Ted
06x07,You said that?,Lily
06x07,"Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought F had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?",Ted
06x07,Yeah.,Lily
06x07,"Hey, guys.",Robin
06x07,"Robin, who'd you sleep with?",Lily
06x07,I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.,Robin
06x07,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
06x07,"Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.",Robin
06x07,What... Why didn't you tell us?,Ted
06x07,"Bladder trouble; it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.",Announcer
06x07,I'm going to the bathroom right now.,Robin
06x07,Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.,Announcer
06x07,Say... Ah...,Robin
06x07,Wow! I can't wait to see it.,Ted
06x07,"Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.",Robin
06x07,It ran for seven years.,Ted from 2030
06x07,"Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation.",Randy
06x07,You think working here is my dream?,Marshall
06x07,"Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.",Randy
06x07,Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.,Marshall
06x07,"Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because...",Ted from 2030
06x07,I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?,Marshall
06x07,Yep. That's a wrap.,Barney
06x08,"Kids, one morning in 2010, I opened the newspaper only to discover an op-ed written by Zoey Pierson. You remember Zoey.",Ted from 2030
06x08,Key Ted Mosby's car.,Zoey
06x08,"In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building: The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day.",Ted from 2030
06x08,She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a fat cat. Me and my fat-cat friends. We're not fat cats.,Ted
06x08,"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",Barney
06x08,"Impeccable, old bean. To industry!",Marshall
06x08,"Ah, bully!",Barney
06x08,"Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us.",Ted from 2030
06x08,"Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?",Marshall
06x08,They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.,Ted
06x08,"Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?",Marshall
06x08,"Nice monkey suit, Russell.",Marshall
06x08,"Come on, guys.",Russel
06x08,"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.",Marshall
06x08,"Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.",Ted
06x08,I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.,Robin
06x08,"Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?",Lily
06x08,"Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.",Marshall
06x08,"Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.",Lily
06x08,"Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.",Ted
06x08,"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.",Lily
06x08,Ooh.,Everyone
06x08,"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",Barney
06x08,"Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?",Marshall
06x08,"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, Don't touch anything. To a kid. That's like someone telling us Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.",Barney
06x08,Ooh.,Everyone
06x08,Not bad.,Robin
06x08,"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",Barney
06x08,"Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.",Robin
06x08,It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?,Barney
06x08,"Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot.",Arthur
06x08,"But you can, and should, call me The Captain.",George
06x08,The Captain?,Marshall
06x08,The Captain?,Barney
06x08,"Back in school we met during a production of Guys and Dolls. The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank.",Arthur
06x08,"Well, ahoy.",George
06x08,Ahoy.,Barney
06x08,"Ahoy, The Captain.",Marshall
06x08,The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.,Arthur
06x08,"Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything.",George
06x08,"Thank you, The Captain.",Marshall
06x08,Challenge accepted.,Barney
06x08,Wow. The future of Goliath National Bank?,Lily
06x08,"I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.",Marshall
06x08,"Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.",Lily
06x08,"So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...",Lily
06x08,I think I'm going to say yes.,Marshall
06x08,"Ah, that's the stuff.",Barney
06x08,"I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.",Robin
06x08,Impressive. Try this on for size.,Barney
06x08,You want to dance? Let's dance.,Robin
06x08,I live for the dance.,Barney
06x08,Get... your other hand... off my ass.,Robin
06x08,"Sorry, sorry.",Barney
06x08,"What do you mean, you're going to say yes?",Lily
06x08,I-I want to keep working at GNB.,Marshall
06x08,But I thought that you...,Lily
06x08,"Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact: If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. : Diarrhea. Right? Right?",Ted
06x08,But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.,Lily
06x08,"Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.",Marshall
06x08,Poo-poo. Poo-poo platter.,"Ted, whispering"
06x08,"Zoey? Well, well, well.",Ted
06x08,You have got to be kidding me.,Zoey
06x08,"So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?",Ted
06x08,"And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?",Zoey
06x08,"Darling, there you are.",George
06x08,"Ted, this is my husband.",Zoey
06x08,"Yeah, old stuff's great.",Ted
06x08,"Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",Robin
06x08,"This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.",Barney
06x08,You're right.,Robin
06x08,Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?,Barney
06x08,"Yeah, I do.",Robin
06x08,"So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?",Ted
06x08,Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.,George
06x08,"Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.",Ted
06x08,This is Ted.,Zoey
06x08,"Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat.",George
06x08,"The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.",Ted
06x08,"Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.",George
06x08,She!,Ted
06x08,Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?,George
06x08,"Yes. The sea is all like, Ted, come hang out.",Ted
06x08,I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off.,George
06x08,"Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.",Ted
06x08,Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.,Zoey
06x08,"No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.",Ted
06x08,You're going down.,Zoey
06x08,"Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?",Ted
06x08,So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?,Lily
06x08,Wieners.,"Ted, whispering"
06x08,"That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.",Marshall
06x08,Wieners and gonads.,Ted
06x08,What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?,Lily
06x08,"Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...",Marshall
06x08,Boogers.,Ted
06x08,"We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell women with a Y anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.",Marshall
06x08,So how long have you felt this way?,Lily
06x08,Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.,Marshall
06x08,Hershey squirts.,Ted
06x08,"Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.",Robin
06x08,"Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?",Ted
06x08,Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.,Zoey
06x08,Good luck klling James Bond.  Are we allowed in here?,Ted
06x08,What do you want from me?,Zoey
06x08,"I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.",Ted
06x08,My life isn't perfect.,Zoey
06x08,"Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.",Ted
06x08,It did.,Ted from 2030
06x08,"You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.",Lily
06x08,"Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.",Marshall
06x08,What?,Lily
06x08,"So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?",Lily
06x08,Affirmatootly.,Marshall
06x08,And become an environmental lawyer?,Lily
06x08,Yepskerdoodles.,Marshall
06x08,"Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?",Lily
06x08,Posititochadochmecochepopocha.,Marshall
06x08,Lawyered.,Marshall
06x08,"Okay, that's also a made-up word.",Lily
06x08,"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.",Marshall
06x08,Niled it.,Barney
06x08,Excuse me.,Museum guard
06x08,Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.,Barney
06x08,I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.,Zoey
06x08,He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.,Ted
06x08,"I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.",Zoey
06x08,"It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.",Ted
06x08,"Ted, that was... really easy.",Zoey
06x08,What?,Ted
06x08,They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.,Ted's voice 
06x08,This should be useful.,Zoey
06x08,"And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes.",Ted from 2030
06x08,You tricked me.,Ted
06x08,"Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.",Zoey
06x08,"Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it...",Guard
06x08,I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?,Robin
06x08,"Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.",Guard
06x08,"Oh, yeah, that story is legend...  Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?",Barney
06x08,"No. But I could, uh, check the files.",Guard
06x08,Thank you.,Barney
06x08,"Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from Guys and Dolls.",George
06x08,"Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche.",Arthur
06x08,So I hear my wife got you pretty good.,George
06x08,She caught me on tape trashing GNB.,Ted
06x08,"Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend. I said no such thing. Oh, yeah? Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings.",George
06x08,Really? You'd do that to your own wife?,Ted
06x08,"Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem.",George
06x08,"No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",Ted
06x08,"Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking.",George
06x08,"Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room.",Ted from 2030
06x08,"July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson.",Guard
06x08,"Who's the master, Leroy?",Barney
06x08,"Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker.",Guard
06x08,"Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.",Barney
06x08,Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.,Guard
06x08,Jerry's my uncle.,Barney
06x08,"Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a hit of this sandwich?",College Marshall
06x08,I want you.,Lily
06x08,Awesome. Let me just put a sock on the doorknob.,College Marshall
06x08,"No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.",Lily
06x08,What? How have I changed? Did I cheat on you?,College Marshall
06x08,No.,Lily
06x08,Did I stop writing poems for you?,College Marshall
06x08,"Yes, but I'm okay with that.",Lily
06x08,"Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you?",College Marshall
06x08,"Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.",Lily
06x08,You said that any longer would be too much.,College Marshall
06x08,"It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.",Lily
06x08,"Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction.",College Marshall
06x08,"Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.",Lily
06x08,They did?,College Marshall
06x08,"Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.",Lily
06x08,Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good?,College Marshall
06x08,Sure.,Lily
06x08,"Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts.",College Marshall
06x08,Hey.,Marshall
06x08,Hi.,Lily
06x08,"Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?",Marshall
06x08,We'll make it work.,Lily
06x08,There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man.,College Marshall
06x08,So when was the last time you saw him?,Robin
06x08,"It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.",Barney
06x08,Moms.,Robin
06x08,He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.,Barney
06x08,"Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...",Robin
06x08,"But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.",Barney
06x08,"Barney, do you want...?",Robin
06x08,"I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?",Barney
06x08,"I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?",Ted
06x08,Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?,Zoey
06x08,"Oh, I thought we were...",Ted
06x08,Fine. I erased the tape.,Zoey
06x08,What?,Ted
06x08,I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square.,Zoey
06x08,Thanks.,Ted
06x08,But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.,Zoey
06x08,"You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.",Ted
06x08,"Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.",Zoey
06x08,"Bring it on, Princess.",Ted
06x08,"Eriksen... It's, uh, 3:00 a.m. You know what, you might as well not even go home.",Arthur
06x08,"And so Marshall stayed right on at Goliath National Bank. Of course, it wouldn't last forever. But that's another story.",Ted from 2030
06x09,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, it seemed like Aunt Lily could only talk about one thing: babies.",Ted from 2030
06x09,"Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.",Robin
06x09,Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.,Lily
06x09,"Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.",Robin
06x09,"Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.",Lily
06x09,They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.,Robin
06x09,Look at this crib.,Lily
06x09,"But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere.",Ted from 2030
06x09,"Oh, you're wearing a flower.",Marshall
06x09,Thank you.,Barney
06x09,"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",Marshall
06x09,I know. Isn't it?,Barney
06x09,Why are you wearing that?,Robin
06x09,Why does Barney do anything ever?,Ted
06x09,"Exactly. Science. There is an 83 correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The everyday boutonniere by Stinson.",Barney
06x09,"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.",Robin
06x09,Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.,Marshall
06x09,"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for bootie is near? True story. Une histoire vraie.",Barney
06x09,Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid,Robin
06x09,"Woman, you best check yourself.",Barney
06x09,"Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...",Robin
06x09,Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!,Barney
06x09,"What, are we gonna duel?",Robin
06x09,"No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!",Barney
06x09,"Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now.",Ted from 2030
06x09,I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!,Barney
06x09,"Oh, you haven't watched it yet?",Marshall
06x09,"No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.",Barney
06x09,"Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.",Marshall
06x09,"Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?",Lily
06x09,"Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.",Robin
06x09,"Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.",Lily
06x09,Space Teens?! Is this a porno?,Barney
06x09,"No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.",Robin
06x09,"I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of prn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.",Ted
06x09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?",Barney
06x09,"Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",Robin
06x09,"Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",Barney
06x09,"Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",Robin
06x09,"Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",Lily
06x09,"Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",Robin
06x09,That sounds ridiculous.,Marshall
06x09,So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to.,Robin Sparkles
06x09,"Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh?",Jessica Glitter
06x09,"Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life.",Robin Sparkles
06x09,"Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.",Robot
06x09,Brace for turbulence!,Robin Sparkles
06x09,"Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",Lily
06x09,"Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",Robin
06x09,You can't do that on television.,Marshall
06x09,Exactly.,Robin
06x09,No. You can't do that on television!,Marshall
06x09,"Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",Ted
06x09,"It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",Robin
06x09,"I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",Marshall
06x09,"You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",Robin
06x09,"Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?",Man
06x09,Oh. 30.,Robin Sparkles
06x09,Yes! Oh! Seven times four?,Man
06x09,28!,Jessica Glitter
06x09,Keep going! Eight times nine?,Man
06x09,72!,Jessica Glitter
06x09,Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?,Man
06x09,"I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",Barney
06x09,"Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",Lily
06x09,"Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",Robin
06x09,But BFFs are forever.,Lily
06x09,"Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",Marshall
06x09,I'm still friends with Punchy.,Ted
06x09,"Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",Marshall
06x09,"Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",Ted
06x09,Schmosby!,Punchy
06x09,Punchy!,Ted
06x09,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",Punchy
06x09,"Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",Ted
06x09,Definitely.,Punchy
06x09,We are just two peas.,Ted
06x09,I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,Lily
06x09,"Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",Robin
06x09,Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,Lily
06x09,"Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",Ted
06x09,"Four years, three months.",Lily
06x09,Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,Ted
06x09,Of course. Robin hates kids.,Marshall
06x09,The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,Barney
06x09,"Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",Ted
06x09,"That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",Marshall
06x09,Robin's gonna dump me!,Lily
06x09,"Oh, sweetheart.",Marshall
06x09,When a second uterus plumped becomes...,Ted
06x09,Dude. Feel the room.,Marshall
06x09,No.,Robin
06x09,We've been waiting all day!,Ted
06x09,Just watch it without me.,Robin
06x09,Two dudes on the couch together watching prn? That's kind of weird.,Barney
06x09,"Okay, it's not prn, it's a kids' show.",Robin
06x09,Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,Ted
06x09,"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",Robin
06x09,We...,Barney
06x09,I'm serious.,Robin
06x09,"Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?",Robin Sparkles
06x09,Great. How's your beaver?,Jessica Glitter
06x09,Busy as ever!,Robin Sparkles
06x09,Our characters had pet beavers.,Robin
06x09,Sure.,Ted
06x09,The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,Robin
06x09,It's a noble creature.,Barney
06x09,"Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?",Man
06x09,"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",Robin
06x09,No arguments here.,Barney
06x09,'Sup Shmosby!,Punchy
06x09,"Punchy, what are you doing here?",Ted
06x09,"Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?",Punchy
06x09,"Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",Ted
06x09,"In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.",Punchy
06x09,Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,Robin
06x09,"I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?",Punchy
06x09,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!",Punchy
06x09,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",Robin
06x09,Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,Ted
06x09,Don't care.,Robin
06x09,He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,Ted
06x09,Get a hotel.,Robin
06x09,Robin... LeBron.,Ted
06x09,"Okay, one night. Got to go.",Robin
06x09,Where are you going? We just got here.,Lily
06x09,"Oh, a Korean massage.",Robin
06x09,By yourself?,Lily
06x09,"Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",Robin
06x09,"Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",Lily
06x09,"Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",Marshall
06x09,"Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",Ted
06x09,"Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",Marshall
06x09,I don't.,Lily
06x09,"Lily, how old am I?",Marshall
06x09,384 months.,Lily
06x09,Busted!,Punchy
06x09,"Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",Marshall
06x09,So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.,Ted from 2030
06x09,"Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",Robin
06x09,Crib...,Lily
06x09,What's the matter? You look rattled.,Robin
06x09,Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,Lily
06x09,What?,Robin
06x09,"Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",Lily
06x09,"Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",Robin
06x09,What's that supposed to mean?,Lily
06x09,"It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",Robin
06x09,"Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",Lily
06x09,Great.,Robin
06x09,Great.,Lily
06x09,For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,Marshall
06x09,"I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",Lily
06x09,"Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you accidentally shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",Marshall
06x09,No!,Lily
06x09,"Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",Marshall
06x09,I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,Lily
06x09,"You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",Marshall
06x09,Okay.,Lily
06x09,"Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",Marshall
06x09,Times Square's the bmb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.,Punchy
06x09,"Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",Ted
06x09,They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?,Punchy
06x09,No.,Ted
06x09,Times Square's the bmb!,Punchy
06x09,"Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",Ted
06x09,I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.,Punchy
06x09,"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, You are the weakest link. Goodbye. Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",Barney
06x09,"Okay, yeah. I know.",Ted
06x09,"You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",Barney
06x09,"Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.",Punchy
06x09,That's your scrotum.,Ted
06x09,"You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.",Punchy
06x09,"Yeah, he's gotta go.",Ted
06x09,What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,Lily
06x09,"Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",Marshall
06x09,How did you find Glitter?,Lily
06x09,"Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",Marshall
06x09,"His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.",Jessica Glitter
06x09,"Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",Marshall
06x09,"So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?",Jessica Glitter
06x09,More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,Lily
06x09,I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.,Jessica Glitter
06x09,"Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",Lily
06x09,"Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.",Jessica Glitter
06x09,What? Why?,Lily
06x09,"Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to kll herself.",Jessica Glitter
06x09,Charge!,Marshall
06x09,Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,Lily
06x09,Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?,Jessica Glitter
06x09,"Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",Lily
06x09,"Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually... Hey. Go ahead.",Jessica Glitter
06x09,"Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?",Punchy
06x09,"Punchy, it's time to go back.",Ted
06x09,Back to Times Square?!,Punchy
06x09,"Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",Ted
06x09,"I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.",Punchy
06x09,You worry about me?,Ted
06x09,"Yeah. The other day, when you called...",Punchy
06x09,Schmosby!,Punchy
06x09,Punchy!,Ted
06x09,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",Punchy
06x09,"Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",Ted
06x09,Definitely.,Punchy
06x09,"Sweetie, who was that?",Woman
06x09,It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.,Punchy
06x09,Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?,Woman
06x09,"Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.",Punchy
06x09,"Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.",Woman
06x09,You think that would work?,Punchy
06x09,Worked on me.,Woman
06x09,"Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",Ted
06x09,"She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.",Punchy
06x09,Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,Ted
06x09,"Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.",Punchy
06x09,Of course I will.,Ted
06x09,"Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...",Punchy
06x09,"That night, Lily went to the one place she knew she could find Robin-- New York's premiere Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut.",Ted from 2030
06x09,"Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",Lily
06x09,"No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",Robin
06x09,I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,Lily
06x09,"Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",Robin
06x09,I'm so happy you guys made up.,Marshall
06x09,"Me, too.",Ted
06x09,Where do I know this song from?,Barney
06x09,"Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?",Robin
06x09,"Hey, beaver, come on; When you feel alone; Just pick up that phone; And I'll be there to share my...","Jessica, singing"
06x09,Ice cream cone; We'll lick it side by side,Robin and Jessica
06x09,Wow. This is so dirty.,Barney
06x09,"Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.",Marshall
06x09,"Yeah, dude, come on.",Ted
06x09,"Day is done; Two beavers are better than one; Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah; Two beavers are better than one; They're twice the fun; Ask anyone; A second beaver can be second to none; Two beavers are better than one.",Robin and Jessica
06x09,"Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...",Robin
06x09,You're my favorite beaver...,Jessica
06x09,"Two beavers are better than one. Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah; Two beavers are better than one; They're twice the fun; Ask anyone; A second beaver ; Can be second to none.",Robin and Jessica
06x09,Two beavers are better than one.,Robot
06x10,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving. And I wanted it to be unforgettable.",Ted from 2030
06x10,"Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!",Ted
06x10,A Turturkeykey?,Lily
06x10,"Yeah, I was there for the insertion. He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.",Robin
06x10,"Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.",Ted
06x10,"What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?",Barney
06x10,"Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.",Marshall
06x10,"Blitz was a guy we knew in college. Sadly, he was cursed.",Ted from 2030
06x10,Well... I'm calling it a little early.,Blitz
06x10,Wh... you sure? We got big plans.,Ted
06x10,"Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?",Marshall
06x10,"Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with Weird Al Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.",Ted
06x10,We'll see what happens.,Marshall
06x10,"Nah, it's Kraft Croft night: mac and cheese and Tomb Raider. Biz-zow!",Blitz
06x10,"You see, every time Blitz left a place, something amazing happened.",Ted from 2030
06x10,Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room.,Woman
06x10,Completely naked!,Ted
06x10,Completely naked!,Marshall
06x10,"Aw, man!",Blitz
06x10,And the movie was awesome.,Marshall
06x10,"Aw, man!",Blitz
06x10,"At the exact moment Brando first appeared, Weird Al launched right into Eat It.",Ted
06x10,"Aw, man!",Blitz
06x10,"And over the years, The Curse of The Blitz continued.",Ted from 2030
06x10,"Well, I'm gonna call it. I just got Madden 2K1, and I can't stop thinking about it.",Blitz
06x10,Tap's broke! Can't turn 'em off! Free beer for everyone!,Bar Tender
06x10,Free beer for everyone!,Ted
06x10,Free beer for everyone!,Marshall
06x10,"Aw, man!",Blitz
06x10,"You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.",Marshall
06x10,"All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe The Curse of The Blitz is real.",Ted
06x10,"Kids, I'd live to regret those words. You see, the Curse of Blitz could be passed from one person to the next, at any moment. Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry Windheim, back in freshman year, who got it years before that from Davey Beaterman. The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s. He dropped out right before the school went co-ed. And then, Thanksgiving morning...",Ted from 2030
06x10,What the hell happened here?,Ted
06x10,"Hey! Morning, Blitz!",Robin
06x10,"Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.",Ted
06x10,My Blitzy lies over the ocean; My Blitzy lies over the sea; My Blitzy lies over the ocean; So bring back my Blitzy...,Barney
06x10,"Please stop. Okay, fine.",Ted
06x10,...To me.,Barney
06x10,The Gentleman!,Lily
06x10,The Gentleman!,Everyone
06x10,Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's The Gentleman?,Ted
06x10,"Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.",Lily
06x10,I'm not The Blitz!  Zoey?,Ted
06x10,"Morning, Blitz!",Zoey
06x10,"Kids, you remember Zoey. For the last two months, she'd been making my life hell.",Ted from 2030
06x10,"Thanks, guys! Last night was amazing! The Gentleman!",Zoey
06x10,The Gentle...,Everyone
06x10,"How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!",Ted
06x10,"Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...",Lily
06x10,I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
06x10,"Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.",Lily
06x10,Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!,Lily
06x10,"Finish the story, Red.",Ted
06x10,"Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.",Lily
06x10,"And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.",Barney
06x10,"Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.",Marshall
06x10,Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?,Barney
06x10,"Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.",Lily
06x10,Can I... help you?,Zoey
06x10,"Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...",Lily
06x10,You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!,Zoey
06x10,"Well, yeah.",Lily
06x10,You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online.,Zoey
06x10,That was you?!,Lily
06x10,Yeah.,Zoey
06x10,Oh! Thanks!,Lily
06x10,"Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.",Robin
06x10,The Gentleman!,Everyone
06x10,"And then, the craziest thing happened.",Lily
06x10,I missed a skateboarding dog?,Ted
06x10,"Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.",Lily
06x10,It wasn't?,Ted
06x10,"Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare?",Zoey
06x10,"Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.",Marshall
06x10,Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger.,Zoey
06x10,Best idea ever!,Marshall
06x10,"Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.",Marshall
06x10,Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers.,Zoey
06x10,"4, 8... 15, 16, 23, 42!",Blitz
06x10,And... send!,Zoey
06x10,"Wait. Blitz was there, too?",Ted
06x10,The Gentleman!,Blitz
06x10,The Gentleman!,Everyone
06x10,"Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said Grand Theft Auto can wait a night.",Blitz
06x10,"It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!",Barney
06x10,I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
06x10,"I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.",Marshall
06x10,Blitz...,Mysterious voice
06x10,"I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years: The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch shots, shting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all!",Blitz
06x10,"Well, not anymore, Blitz.",Barney
06x10,"My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz.",Blitz
06x10,"What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!",Ted
06x10,I tried.,Lily
06x10,"Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Rene Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!",Ted
06x10,"Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!",Lily
06x10,That's Kate Hudson!,Ted
06x10,"Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.",Lily
06x10,"No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen?  Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.",Ted
06x10,The oven.,Robin
06x10,"Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.",Barney
06x10,Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out...,"Everyone, chanting"
06x10,Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome!,Steve
06x10,"Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?",Ted
06x10,"Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.",Barney
06x10,"But if it helps, I reached 4G.",Lily
06x10,It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,Ted
06x10,This is awesome! I'm part of this!,Steve
06x10,"Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",Ted
06x10,Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,Barney
06x10,"Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explsin at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",Marshall
06x10,This is awesome!,Steve
06x10,It's not awesome!,Ted
06x10,I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,Robin
06x10,Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,Barney
06x10,"Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger.",Steve
06x10,"Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.",Lily
06x10,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.",Zoey
06x10,Could we bring Ted?,Lily
06x10,It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?,Zoey
06x10,No. Absolutely not.,Ted
06x10,Come on. Give her a chance.,Lily
06x10,"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.",Robin
06x10,Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,Marshall
06x10,"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",Barney
06x10,"But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?",Babaka
06x10,No. I c... Because... Step on it.,Barney
06x10,You missed it.,Marshall
06x10,"Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!",Steve
06x10,Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang Twist and Shout!,Robin
06x10,But he's The Blitz.,Barney
06x10,No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.,Ted
06x10,Blitz...,Mysterious voice
06x10,"Oh, God, no!",Barney
06x10,"Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.",Marshall
06x10,Chicka-chicka!,Ted
06x10,Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.,Zoey
06x10,Zoey.,Ted
06x10,Best friend alert!,Lily
06x10,"Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.",Ted
06x10,"Oh, God, that is disgusting!",Marshall
06x10,"Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.",Ted
06x10,"No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.",Marshall
06x10,"Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.",Robin
06x10,It's a boom-a-wang.,Lily
06x10,Nice.,Robin
06x10,Thank you.,Lily
06x10,"No, I meant the wang.",Robin
06x10,"Barney, could you get me some more ice?",Zoey
06x10,Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. : I'm scared.,Barney
06x10,You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.,Steve
06x10,Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,Barney
06x10,"Okay, I got to test this.",Steve
06x10,What happened?,Barney
06x10,You missed it!,Lily
06x10,"Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",Marshall
06x10,"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!",Barney
06x10,I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.,Steve
06x10,"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. 100! No-- 10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",Barney
06x10,"Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.",Marshall
06x10,"Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.",Zoey
06x10,"Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.",Ted
06x10,Facial!,Steve
06x10,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.",Ted
06x10,I'm coming with you.,Zoey
06x10,No... I baste alone.,Ted
06x10,"Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.",Zoey
06x10,Word play. Loving it.,Steve
06x10,But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.,Zoey
06x10,Who canceled? Your coven?,Ted
06x10,Coven. Group of witches.,Steve
06x10,Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.,Zoey
06x10,Oh! Serve returned.,Steve
06x10,Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,Ted
06x10,"Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",Zoey
06x10,"God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling.",Steve
06x10,"Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",Ted
06x10,"Ted, give her a chance.",Lily
06x10,Enemies can't become friends.,Ted
06x10,"Yes, they can. Right, guys?",Zoey
06x10,"No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.",Ted
06x10,"Well, let's get an outside opinion.",Robin
06x10,Who are we gonna...,Ted
06x10,Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.,Robin
06x10,Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?,Ted
06x10,"He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...",Robin
06x10,"Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?",Lily
06x10,What? No. Shut up. I hate him.,Robin
06x10,"Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. Yes, enemies can become friends. Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'",Marshall
06x10,"Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?",Steve
06x10,"That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha!  Burn on her.",Barney
06x10,"Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.",Steve
06x10,I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!,Barney
06x10,What does that have to do with anything?,Robin
06x10,Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,Barney
06x10,"Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.",Ted
06x10,"Oh, my God!",Ted
06x10,Did you do that on purpose?,Zoey
06x10,What? No. It was an accident.,Ted
06x10,"Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.",Zoey
06x10,"Oh, great. Real mature.",Ted
06x10,"Yeah, well, you started it.",Zoey
06x10,"Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.",Lily
06x10,"Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
06x10,"Oh, get out. All of you, out!",Zoey
06x10,But it's Thanksgiving.,Lily
06x10,And I'm a part of it.,Steve
06x10,Out!,Zoey
06x10,Wait... Where's Barney?,Marshall
06x10,"Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.",Barney
06x10,I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?,Lily
06x10,And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear.,Ted from 2030
06x10,Where to?,Driver
06x10,I guess we're going home.,Ted
06x10,Yeah. I don't know where that is.,Driver
06x10,"Lily, where'd you get that?",Ted
06x10,"Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey. I wonder who Hannah is.",Lily
06x10,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",Zoey
06x10,"And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
06x10,"Get out! All of you, out!",Zoey
06x10,We have to go back to Zoey's.,Ted
06x10,"You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.",Driver
06x10,"Oh, God. What are you doing here?",Zoey
06x10,Barney let us in.,Ted
06x10,Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.,Zoey
06x10,"Aw, man! Wait. Which half?",Barney
06x10,"Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.",Ted
06x10,How do you know that?,Zoey
06x10,I just do. It must be tough.,Ted
06x10,"It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.",Zoey
06x10,"I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.",Ted
06x10,Yeah... Right. Next year.,Zoey
06x10,"Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.",Ted
06x10,And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends.,Ted from 2030
06x10,Cheers.,Everyone
06x10,"Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.",Zoey
06x10,"Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.",Marshall
06x10,"Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.",Zoey
06x10,Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.,Ted
06x10,It didn't. It tasted wrong.,Ted from 2030
06x10,Oops. We forgot to light the candles.,Steve
06x10,"And just as Barney looked away, it happened.",Ted from 2030
06x10,The Gentleman!,Everyone
06x10,What happened? I saw it!,Barney
06x10,"Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.",Steve
06x10,"Oh, hold the door!",Woman
06x10,"Thank you, God!",Barney
06x10,Blitz.,Mysterious voice
06x11,"Kids, in the winter of 2010, we had a new addition to our little group... Zoey. Zoey was married to... The Captain.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?",Captain
06x11,Okay. That man is terrifying.,Marshall
06x11,"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",Barney
06x11,Keep smiling. He can still see us.,Ted
06x11,There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...,Ted from 2030
06x11,I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.,Marshall
06x11,Okay.,Robin
06x11,"Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy.  But the top half of his face...wants to mrder you! Cheerful. Wants to mrder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to mrder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",Marshall
06x11,"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",Barney
06x11,"Whoa, he hates them.",Marshall
06x11,"Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.",Robin
06x11,Ooh. What-What is that?,Ted
06x11,I don't get it.,Robin and Lily
06x11,He hates that he loves them.,Marshall
06x11,"Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",Ted
06x11,"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",Lily
06x11,Running the water.,Marshall
06x11,Holding the towel.,Robin
06x11,And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,Barney
06x11,"All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",Ted
06x11,"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",Lily
06x11,Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,Barney
06x11,Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles.,Lily
06x11,"Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",Marshall
06x11,"Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.",Lily
06x11,"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",Ted
06x11,And the most important rule of all...,Lily
06x11,Lubricant is public property.,Barney
06x11,Please.,Marshall
06x11,No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,Lily
06x11,"Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",Ted
06x11,"Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite sx.",Marshall
06x11,"Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",Robin
06x11,"No doubt, Robo Cop.",Marshall
06x11,You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.,Lily
06x11,I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.,Marshall
06x11,"Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.",Robin
06x11,Oh! Sweet. No candles.,Lily
06x11,"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",Barney
06x11,And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.,Ted from 2030
06x11,Nah.,Lily
06x11,"Wait. No. It had to be more than just, Nah. Oh, I think she said...",Ted from 2030
06x11,You're a big... stupid octopus head!,Lily
06x11,"No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",Ted
06x11,"Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.",Zoey
06x11,Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,Ted
06x11,"Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",Lily
06x11,"Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",Ted
06x11,"Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?",Zoey
06x11,It's totally okay.,Ted
06x11,"It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on youI love your momI never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",Lily
06x11,What's wrong with this shirt?,Marshall
06x11,"Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",Ted
06x11,"No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",Lily
06x11,"Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",Ted
06x11,"Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",Lily
06x11,"The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics: cold weather...",Ted from 2030
06x11,December chill... so great.,Robin
06x11,Totally.,Marshall
06x11,...sports...,Ted from 2030
06x11,Did you catch the game last night?,Marshall
06x11,Yeah. Nail-biter.,Robin
06x11,...and cold weather sports.,Ted from 2030
06x11,You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.,Marshall
06x11,They are fun.,Robin
06x11,They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.,Ted from 2030
06x11,"Man, this is awkward.",Robin
06x11,"She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",Marshall
06x11,"Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",Robin
06x11,Can I get you two some drinks?,Waiter
06x11,Lots of drinks.,Marshall
06x11,"Oh, so many drinks.",Robin
06x11,"That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?",Ted from 2030
06x11,Barney.,Lily
06x11,"Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",Barney
06x11,"Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",Lily
06x11,"No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!",Barney
06x11,Watch out!,Lily
06x11,Wait. They were on the street.,Ted from 2030
06x11,Watch out!,Lily
06x11,"Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",Barney
06x11,I think I probably didn't.,Lily
06x11,"And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes.",Ted from 2030
06x11,Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.,Lily
06x11,"Like I said, the fight was just getting started.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",Ted
06x11,"Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.",Captain
06x11,"Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",Ted
06x11,"Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.",Captain
06x11,"Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",Ted
06x11,"You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!",Captain
06x11,"Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",Robin
06x11,You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,Marshall
06x11,"What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",Robin
06x11,"Robin, I'm an attorney.",Marshall
06x11,Fine. This night's a little awkward.,Robin
06x11,I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,Marshall
06x11,Why is that?,Robin
06x11,It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,Marshall
06x11,"Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",Marshall
06x11,"So, who's the eye broccoli?",Barney
06x11,"Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",Marshall
06x11,"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",Barney
06x11,I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,Marshall
06x11,"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",Barney
06x11,I'm sorry. Myth?,Marshall
06x11,"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",Barney
06x11,"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",Marshall
06x11,D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,Barney
06x11,Did we bet on this?,Marshall
06x11,Let's say yes.,Barney
06x11,And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,Robin
06x11,"As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",Marshall
06x11,"Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",Robin
06x11,Big-time manatee.,Marshall
06x11,What were those sailors thinking?,Robin
06x11,Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,Marshall
06x11,"Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this.  Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.",Captain
06x11,"He's gonna kll me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",Ted
06x11,"So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.",Captain
06x11,"Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",Lily
06x11,"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",Barney
06x11,"Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.",Ted from 2030
06x11,Want to hang?,Lily
06x11,Nah. Watch out!,Barney
06x11,"Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",Lily
06x11,"If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",Lily
06x11,"Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
06x11,You're a jerk.,Lily
06x11,"Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.",Captain
06x11,"Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",Ted
06x11,"How now? Oh, bother.  Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.",Captain
06x11,Head?,Ted
06x11,"200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.",Captain
06x11,"Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",Ted
06x11,"Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.",Captain
06x11,": Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a Good Effort ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.",Ted
06x11,Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.,Captain
06x11,"And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.",Ted from 2030
06x11,Ted?,Captain
06x11,"you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",Robin
06x11,"Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",Marshall
06x11,Am I blushing or...?,Robin
06x11,"...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' Part of Your World to my pants.",Marshall
06x11,"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",Robin
06x11,I asked Barney the same thing.,Marshall
06x11,"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",Barney
06x11,Death?,Marshall
06x11,"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",Barney
06x11,Pregnancy?,Robin
06x11,"Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",Marshall
06x11,"Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",Barney
06x11,"Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.",Liy
06x11,"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",Barney
06x11,"Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",Lily
06x11,That was it! I remember now!,Ted from 2030
06x11,"Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",Lily
06x11,"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
06x11,Oh... You're a jerk.,Lily
06x11,"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",Barney
06x11,What's that?,Lily
06x11,Breast-feeding. Hot.,Barney
06x11,Really?,Lily
06x11,Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,Barney
06x11,That's so sweet!,Lily
06x11,See kids? Told you I'd get it!,Ted from 2030
06x11,"Okay, now we're even!",Ted
06x11,"Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.",Ted from 2030
06x11,So you really thought I was gonna kll you?,Captain
06x11,Well... ish.,Ted
06x11,"Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kll you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.",Captain
06x11,See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,Ted
06x11,"Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.",Captain
06x11,We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,Ted
06x11,Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.,Captain
06x11,"You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking... I had fun.","Robin, slurring"
06x11,"Yeah, me, too.",Marshall
06x11,And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...,Ted from 2030
06x11,"No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",Marshall
06x11,"Uh-oh. I don't feel so good.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",Robin
06x11,I really do.,Marshall
06x11,"And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.",Ted from 2030
06x11,"Hey, Ted.",Zoey
06x11,Hey. You feeling better?,Ted
06x11,I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.,Zoey
06x11,You weren't?,Ted
06x11,"I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.",Zoey
06x11,"I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",Ted
06x11,"Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.",Zoey
06x11,"Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",Ted
06x11,"Me, too.",Zoey
06x11,"I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",Ted
06x11,No. Do you?,Zoey
06x11,No.,Ted
06x11,Still no sign of land.,Sailor  1
06x11,It's been 243 days since we've seen another living soul. What are you looking at?,Sailor  2
06x11,"Dude, we need to find land.",Sailor  1
06x12,"In December of 2010, my friends and I decided to go see It's a Wonderful Life on the big screen. It seemed like something we all needed. After all, it had been a crazy couple of days. It all started...",Ted from 2030
06x12,With a pregnancy test.,Ted from 2030
06x12,This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right?,Marshall
06x12,Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?,Lily
06x12,"Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim?",Marshall
06x12,"Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days.",Lily
06x12,"Okay, you're the one who put the Far Side calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body.",Marshall
06x12,It's been two minutes.,Lily
06x12,"One, two, three.",Marshall  Lily
06x12,It's positive.,Lily
06x12,It's positive? It's positive.,Marshall
06x12,I'm pregnant.,Lily
06x12,What?!,Robin
06x12,I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!,Barney
06x12,To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
06x12,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now.",Marshall
06x12,You're not pregnant.,Doctor
06x12,"Well, that did it.",Marshall
06x12,"Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours we all thought Lily was pregnant, and how it caused each of us to reexamine our own lives. Because while this was happening...",Ted from 2030
06x12,Are you sure you did it right?,Marshall
06x12,"...I was on the phone with Punchy, my best friend from high school, who had recently asked me to be his best man.",Ted from 2030
06x12,"Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.",Ted
06x12,"Ah, here it comes. Hit me up, Schmos!",Punchy
06x12,"Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.",Ted
06x12,That's exactly the accent of whimsy this celebration of love needs!,Punchy
06x12,It's gonna be a magical day.  I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude.,Ted
06x12,I do wish you were a dude.,Robin
06x12,"Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.",Ted
06x12,"No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rfle and charge up the hill.",Robin
06x12,"Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man.",Ted
06x12,And how did that go again? Oh for one.,Robin
06x12,"Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.",Ted
06x12,"Ted.  Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?",Robin
06x12,"Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.",Ted
06x12,"Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails was an extremely popular show with an extremely simple premise.",Ted from 2030
06x12,"All right, your practice flip came up tails... But our Vegas oddsmaker tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50. And so, Jordan, for one million dollars......Heads... or tails?",Animator
06x12,What was the year of the coin again?,Jordan
06x12,Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails?,Ted
06x12,"Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening.",Robin
06x12,Ta... heads.,Jordin
06x12,"Marni, flip that coin.",Animator
06x12,"So now, because of that incident, Heads or Tails is looking for a new currency rotation specialist.",Robin
06x12,You mean coin flip bimbo?,Ted
06x12,They're not bimbos!,Robin
06x12,"You auditioned, didn't you?",Ted
06x12,You're the new coin flip bimbo?,Ted
06x12,Currency rotation specialist.,Robin
06x12,"Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?",Ted
06x12,"Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!",Robin
06x12,"Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?",Ted
06x12,I am never drinking again.,Robin
06x12,"No, before that.",Ted
06x12,I am gonna finish this whole bottle tonight.,"Robin, slurring"
06x12,"Before that, too.",Ted
06x12,"I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth.",Robin
06x12,I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.,Ted
06x12,"Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.",Robin
06x12,Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.,Ted
06x12,"Well, so could Heads or Tails.  The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.",Robin
06x12,"It seemed like there was no changing Robin's mind. But what we didn't know, in that moment, was that our world was about to be turned upside down.",Ted from 2030
06x12,I'm pregnant.,Lily
06x12,What?!,Robin
06x12,"Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them... For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself.",Ted from 2030
06x12,"Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.",Robin
06x12,"And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate.",Ted from 2030
06x12,"Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.",Robin
06x12,"Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.",Marshall
06x12,What changed your mind?,Ted
06x12,"Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist...  Who gives her beer.",Robin
06x12,What?,Lily
06x12,What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
06x12,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
06x12,So the next day Robin called Heads or Tails to respectfully decline.,Ted from 2030
06x12,"Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.",Robin
06x12,But at that moment...,Ted from 2030
06x12,You're not pregnant.,Doctor
06x12,"As honored as I am by the offer, um...  Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty.",Robin
06x12,You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.,Robin
06x12,You took the Heads or tails job?,Ted
06x12,Yeah.,Robin
06x12,"What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.",Ted
06x12,"Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?",Robin
06x12,We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.,Ted
06x12,"Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy.",Robin
06x12,Where the hell is Barney?,Ted
06x12,Where was Barney? Let's back up again.,Ted from 2030
06x12,"You see, while this was going on...",Ted from 2030
06x12,It's positive.,Marshall  Lily
06x12,...This was happening.,Ted from 2030
06x12,And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.,Robin
06x12,"Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?",Barney
06x12,Bon Jovi?,Ted
06x12,"Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n?  Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check.",Barney
06x12,"My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was 15 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Ted
06x12,"And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit.",Barney
06x12,"Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?",Ted
06x12,"Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.",Barney
06x12,"Hey, guys. Big announcement.",Marshall
06x12,"Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.",Ted
06x12,"No, just a 30 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Marshall
06x12,Thirty?!,Ted
06x12,I'm pregnant.,Lily
06x12,What?!,Robin
06x12,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
06x12,Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?,Barney
06x12,we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.,Marshall
06x12,"Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight,  is Barney's Favorite Things!",Barney
06x12,That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got.,Ted from 2030
06x12,Huh? I don't know what that is.,Marshall
06x12,"Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?",Barney
06x12,The next hour got pretty weird.,Ted from 2030
06x12,Velour track suits!,Barney
06x12,Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.,Marshall
06x12,Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club!  You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more.,Barney
06x12,No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.,Ted
06x12,I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.,Barney
06x12,"The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island.",Ted from 2030
06x12,"Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless...",Barney
06x12,"What's up, Barney?",Sam
06x12,I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.,Barney
06x12,"Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney.",Sam
06x12,"No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail.",Barney
06x12,"What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe.",Sam
06x12,"I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more.",Barney
06x12,"Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews.",Sam
06x12,"Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero...",Barney
06x12,You're not pregnant.,Doctor
06x12,"...Zero...  Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.",Barney
06x12,"That's great. Thank you, Barney!",Sam
06x12,"Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.",Barney
06x12,What happened to giving the money away?,Ted
06x12,"Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born.  Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!",Barney
06x12,It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!,Ted
06x12,"Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.",Barney
06x12,Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
06x12,Let's back up one last time.,Ted from 2030
06x12,I'm pregnant.,Lily
06x12,What?!,Robin
06x12,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
06x12,"This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now.",Marshall
06x12,"I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my vg1n!",Lily
06x12,Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?,Marshall
06x12,What am I doing with my life?,Robin
06x12,What am I doing with my life?,Barney
06x12,I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.,Ted
06x12,They're totally onto us. What do we do?,Marshall
06x12,"Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense!",Lily
06x12,I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.,Marshall
06x12,"Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.",Lily
06x12,Narrator: So Marshall and Lily headed home.,Ted from 2030
06x12,"Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!",Marshall
06x12,"Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy.",Lily
06x12,Nursery's painted!,Marshall
06x12,Blue? What if it's a girl?,Lily
06x12,Damn it!,Marshall
06x12,"Oh, God, it's 8:00! We're supposed to meet the gang at the bar to celebrate.",Lily
06x12,"Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?!",Marshall
06x12,"No, I can't keep it together!",Lily
06x12,I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
06x12,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
06x12,This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong!,Marshall
06x12,The iPod was on shuffle!  The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!,Lily
06x12,"You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny.",Marshall
06x12,"The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful.",Lily
06x12,"You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips.",Marshall
06x12,"Marshall, I don't like this.",Lily
06x12,"I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away!",Marshall
06x12,You're not pregnant.,Doctor
06x12,"Well, that did it.",Marshall
06x12,I know this probably comes as quite a disappointment.,Doctor
06x12,Yeah. Huge bummer.,Marshall
06x12,So disappointing.,Lily
06x12,Are you guys okay?,Ted
06x12,"Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing.",Lily
06x12,"Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.",Marshall
06x12,Don't reach into the living room!,Lily
06x12,"Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.",Ted
06x12,"Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there.",Marshall
06x12,"Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.",Lily
06x12,"Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.",Marshall
06x12,Get a puppy!,Barney
06x12,Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!,Marshall
06x12,No!,"Ted, yelling"
06x12,Oh. Our movie snack.,Barney
06x12,"Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!",Ted
06x12,Marshall and Lily got in trouble.,Barney
06x12,"And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.",Ted
06x12,"I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!",Barney
06x12,Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!,Ted
06x12,"So, if I get a large popcorn, you want to go split-skees or...","Robin, stuttering"
06x12,"And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work: Heads, you take the job at World Wide News; Tails, you take the job at World Wide News. Ow! Hey, looks like somebody got a new gig!",Ted
06x12,"Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now.",Robin
06x12,Hello.,Ted
06x12,"Ted, I can't get married!",Punchy
06x12,"Yes, you can! You love her!",Ted
06x12,"You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!",Punchy
06x12,"One for It's a Wonderful Life, please. Thank you.",Ted
06x12,We're idiots.,Marshall
06x12,This kid doesn't stand a chance.,Lily
06x12,We're ready for this.,Marshall
06x12,We're ready for this.,Lily
06x12,Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point?,Sam
06x12,Nope.,Barney
06x12,"And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I.D. badge.",Woman
06x12,You sure?,Marshall
06x12,Positive.,Lily
06x12,And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?,Barney
06x12,Yeah. Why?,Sam
06x12,"Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.",Barney
06x12,"Thank you, son.",Sam
06x12,Son?!,Barney
06x12,It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad.,Sam
06x12,Congratulations.,Ted
06x12,"You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path.",Robin
06x12,It's what I do.,Ted
06x12,"Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...",Robin
06x12,"Big mistake, but go on.",Ted
06x12,"...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?",Robin
06x12,Are you asking what I think you're asking?,Ted
06x12,"Ted, will you be my best man?",Robin
06x12,Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,Ted
06x12,"Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",Barney
06x12,"Um, no.",Woman
06x12,"Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight...",Barney
06x13,"Kids, when Lily and Marshall started trying to have a baby, they went a little crazy.",Ted from 2030
06x13,"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.",Lily
06x13,And how long have you been trying?,Doctor
06x13,Six days.,Lily
06x13,"But then, months went by, and still nothing happened.",Ted from 2030
06x13,Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.,Lily
06x13,"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.",Marshall
06x13,"Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",Lily
06x13,"Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city.",Doctor
06x13,"Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",Marshall
06x13,"Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected sx day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",Lily
06x13,"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",Barney
06x13,I'm not playing laser tag.,Marshall
06x13,I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.,Ted
06x13,Damn it.,Marshall
06x13,And Marshall's the winner.,Barney
06x13,"Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.",Lily
06x13,"So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City.",Ted from 2030
06x13,So I understand you want to get pregnant.,Stangel
06x13,"Yeah, and it cuts in and out.",Barney
06x13,Ooh! How did you do it?,Lily
06x13,"Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?",Barney
06x13,What are you talking about?,Lily
06x13,What are you talking about?,Barney
06x13,My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.,Lily
06x13,"We'll look at all the factors that contribute to fertility: dietary, environmental, genetic. But first, Ms. Aldrin, do you have any questions for me?",Strangel
06x13,"Just one, Dr. Stangel. Where'd you get the beard?",Lily
06x13,"Well, m... my mother's Armenian.",Strangel
06x13,"Lily, I've been with Barney since 9:00 a.m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight.",Marshall
06x13,"Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?",Lily
06x13,Not today I wasn't.,Barney
06x13,"Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney.",Ted
06x13,"Uh, Marshall?",Lily
06x13,"Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...",Marshall
06x13,"No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",Lily
06x13,Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.,Barney
06x13,I still kind of think it's Barney.,Lily
06x13,There's no way it's Barney.,Marshall
06x13,"Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen. I am Dr. Stangel.",Stangel
06x13,"It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",Marshall
06x13,Would you...? I...,Stangel
06x13,So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.,Marshall
06x13,"All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin.",Stangel
06x13,"Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",Lily
06x13,"No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.",Marshall
06x13,He checks out. I really don't have time for this.,Stangel
06x13,"No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?",Marshall
06x13,"Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.",Barney
06x13,"Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the vg1n.",Stangel
06x13,Okay. Convinced.,Lily
06x13,"Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up.",Stangel
06x13,Suit up... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.,Lily
06x13,"Baby, you just saw Barney.",Marshall
06x13,He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?,Lily
06x13,"Oh, yeah... Bjorney.",Marshall
06x13,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.",Lily
06x13,"How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!",Barney
06x13,"Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results.",Strangel
06x13,Thank you.,Lily
06x13,"Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!",Barney
06x13,Can we leave him in here for a while?,Lily
06x13,I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.,Strangel
06x13,"Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!",Barney
06x13,"Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate.",Ted from 2030
06x13,"So, first day of work?",Ted
06x13,"Everyone, say hello to your new research associate Robin Scherbatsky.",Woman
06x13,"Hi, guys.",Robin
06x13,"Oh, here comes our new Hardfire host. Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.",Woman
06x13,Sandy Rivers?!,Ted
06x13,Sandy Rivers... Robin's old co-host and my old nemesis.,Ted from 2030
06x13,We should have sx.,Sandy
06x13,"Oh, I hate that guy.",Ted
06x13,It gets worse.,Robin
06x13,"Sandy, this is...",Woman
06x13,Robin.,Sandy
06x13,You two know each other?,Woman
06x13,Know each other? We've had sx.,Sandy
06x13,You had sx with Sandy Rivers?,Ted
06x13,"No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.",Robin
06x13,Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?,Ted
06x13,"Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.",Robin
06x13,"Hey, babe.",Marshall
06x13,"Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.",Lily
06x13,"Yeah, uh, we got a game of Go Fish going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?",Marshall
06x13,Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.,Lily
06x13,"You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.",Marshall
06x13,"Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.",Lily
06x13,"Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected sx 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.",Marshall
06x13,Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.,Barney
06x13,"So, second day of work?",Ted
06x13,What's wrong?,Lily
06x13,"Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.",Ted
06x13,"Already? Oh, honey.",Lily
06x13,I wish I was the office slut.,Robin
06x13,And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.,Robin
06x13,Yes. We definitely had sx.,Sandy
06x13,We did not have sx.,Robin
06x13,Then why do I remember you?,Sandy
06x13,"I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.",Robin
06x13,"No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have sx.",Sandy
06x13,Thank you.,Robin
06x13,You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop...,Sandy
06x13,We did have sx.,Robin
06x13,"Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor.",Sandy
06x13,But this reporter takes pride in...,Robin
06x13,And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.,Robin
06x13,"Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.",Ted
06x13,"Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney gns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",Barney
06x13,"Oh, it's my dad.",Marshall
06x13,Aren't you going to get it?,Ted
06x13,"No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.",Marshall
06x13,He has to do that?,Ted
06x13,But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.,Robin
06x13,"I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.",Marshall
06x13,I'm getting married!,Marshall
06x13,Yeah...!,Marvin
06x13,I passed the bar!,Marshall
06x13,All right!,Marvin
06x13,"I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord.",Marshall
06x13,That's what I'm talking about!,Marvin
06x13,Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!,Marshall
06x13,"But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.",Marshall
06x13,"I'll show you. Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion.",Barney
06x13,"Barney, I've already told...",Marshall
06x13,"Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome.",Barney
06x13,"So, third day of work?",Ted
06x13,"And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...",Robin
06x13,Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius.,Sandy
06x13,"Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.",Robin
06x13,A few?,Sandy
06x13,"Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.",Robin
06x13,Gregory.,Sandy
06x13,"Oh, God. What did they find?",Ted
06x13,Everything.,Robin
06x13,"Everybody, come and play... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today... The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest...  Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Let's got to the mall today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today; Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today... ; Let's go to the mall...",Robin
06x13,They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl.,Robin
06x13,You got attacked by an owl?,Ted
06x13,I did not get attacked by an owl.,Robin
06x13,"Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...",Ted
06x13,"Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.",Robin
06x13,"Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me.",Ted from 2030
06x13,Show me owl attack.,Ted
06x13,I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.,Marshall
06x13,"Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised.",Stangel
06x13,"All yours, buddy. The thing you're about to do in here... I did that in here, too. Three minutes ago.",Man  1
06x13,I was here eight minutes ago.,Man  2
06x13,14 minutes ago.,Man  3
06x13,I'm here every Thursday.,Man  4
06x13,"I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home?",Marshall
06x13,"Sure, you could, but, uh... we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.",Stangel
06x13,"Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.",Marshall
06x13,Surprise!,Marvin
06x13,Surprise!,Judy
06x13,Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?,Marshall
06x13,We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you.,Judy
06x13,"For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes?",Marvin
06x13,"Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?",Marshall
06x13,"Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.",Lily
06x13,"Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.",Marshall
06x13,"Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.",Lily
06x13,"Thank you, baby. You're the best.",Marshall
06x13,"Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it!",Judy
06x13,That's why Fred Cox is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had.,Marvin
06x13,Give me a C. Give me an O. Give me an X. What's that spell? Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox!,Marvin
06x13,"Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.",Ted
06x13,Who?,Robin
06x13,Sorry. You said who. It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. Who. Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.,Ted
06x13,"Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.",Robin
06x13,I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.,Ted
06x13,"Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.",Robin
06x13,They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.,Ted
06x13,Ah... You're not the pizza guy.,Sandy
06x13,"Oh, my God. This is...",Robin
06x13,"This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.",Ted
06x13,If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...,Robin
06x13,Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?,Ted
06x13,"Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy.",Robin
06x13,"And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming?",Judy
06x13,This isn't working.,Marshall
06x13,"Where you going, son?",Marvin
06x13,I'm... I'm going to... I'm... I'm going to...,Marshall
06x13,"Kids, to this day, your uncle Marshall is thankful for what Lily said next.",Ted from 2030
06x13,He's going to mstrbt.,Lily
06x13,Lily!,Marshall
06x13,"Marshall, just tell them what's going on.",Lily
06x13,And so Marshall told his parents everything.,Ted from 2030
06x13,"And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.",Marshall
06x13,"Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm?",Judy
06x13,"Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption.",Marshall
06x13,"What I'm saying is, we love you no matter what. Now, why don't you pretend you're in high school, get back in that bathroom, and blow dry your hair.",Marvin
06x13,"Wait, you knew?",Marshall
06x13,"We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.",Judy
06x13,So? Possibly last day of work?,Ted
06x13,"Actually, it was a good day.",Robin
06x13,"And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls?",Sandy
06x13,"Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see.",Robin
06x13,Yes! Put him in a body bag!,Ted
06x13,"Okay, I didn't do it.",Robin
06x13,What?,Ted
06x13,I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of...,Robin
06x13,Owl?,Ted
06x13,"Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice.",Robin
06x13,"That day, Robin decided to steer into the skid. And though she never quite shook the nickname, Sparkles went on to do very well at World Wide News. Especially after this happened.",Ted from 2030
06x13,"After his parents had gone back to Minnesota, Marshall got the results of his test.",Ted from 2030
06x13,"I'm afraid I have some very bad news, Marshall. Judging from the results of your test, it is... it is very unlikely that you'll be able to father a child.",Stangel
06x13,"Oh, God.",Marshall
06x13,"I know, I know.",Stangel
06x13,It's just...,Marshall
06x13,"Now... in some rare cases, a regimen change can fix the problem, so I'm recommending a spirited cardio routine. Preferably with a partner, involving any light-based firearm activity in the Tri-State area. Poughkeepsie, for example. Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport known as laser tag? Surprise!",Stangel
06x13,"Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?",Marshall
06x13,"Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20 off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation?",Barney
06x13,"Go! Well, Marshall. I've got your results.",Stangel
06x13,And?,Marshall
06x13,Your sperm is fine.,Stangel
06x13,My sperm is fine!,Marshall
06x13,"Count, motility... everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers.",Stangel
06x13,"Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!",Barney
06x13,"Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad.",Marshall
06x13,"Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
06x13,"Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was.",Marshall
06x13,"You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it?",Marshall
06x13,"Marshall... Something's happened. Um... Your father, he had a heart attack. He... he didn't make it.",Lily
06x13,My dad's dead? I'm not ready for this.,Marshall
06x14,"Kids, when your best friend loses someone...",Ted from 2030
06x14,My dad's dead?,Marshall
06x14,...you drop everything and rush to his side only to find yourself standing there with no idea what to do or say.,Ted from 2030
06x14,This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?,Ted
06x14,"Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, I have to pee. And I, Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you. Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, This doesn't even make sense!",Lily
06x14,"Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.",Robin
06x14,"Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.",Ted
06x14,"Be cool, nerds!","Robin, hushing"
06x14,"Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy!",Lily
06x14,"Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?",Robin
06x14,Sweet save.,"Ted, whispering"
06x14,"Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.",Lily
06x14,Judy duty.,Ted
06x14,She said doody.,Barney
06x14,"Really, guys? At a funeral?",Robin
06x14,"Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.",Ted
06x14,"Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.",Barney
06x14,How?,Robin
06x14,"Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?",Barney
06x14,Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.,Ted
06x14,"Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.",Barney
06x14,What about animals?,Ted
06x14,"Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!",Barney
06x14,"Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?",Marshall
06x14,Outlet or USB?,Robin
06x14,"Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh...",Marshall
06x14,"Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?",Lily
06x14,"You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.",Ted
06x14,"If? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. Spoonful of sugar...? Grow up.",Robin
06x14,"I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.",Reverend
06x14,"Thank you, Reverend.",Judy
06x14,"Unfortunately, I can't. My daughter in Chicago just went into labor. But I'm leaving you in the capable hands of my second-in-command: my son.",Reverend
06x14,Your son?,Marshall
06x14,"Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him.",Reverend
06x14,"Guys... Trey Platt terrorized me growing up. He was, he was the toughest bully in school.",Marshall
06x14,'Sup Marshall.,Trey
06x14,"Hello, Trey. Long time. Mm-hmm. I was not aware that you had become a reverend.",Marshall
06x14,"Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding!",Trey
06x14,"Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.",Barney
06x14,"Yeah! This video is entitled, Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can. I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.",Ted
06x14,Oh!,Barney
06x14,"See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...",Barney
06x14,"...right in the nuts,",Ted
06x14,The fat kid just runs away.,Barney
06x14,Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey The Noogie Machine Platt.,Marshall
06x14,"That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?",Ted
06x14,He made me carry it.,Marshall
06x14,"So, my dad has these questions he asks to help create a theme for the service, or whatever. Question one: What were your last words with the deceased? Lame. Question two:",Trey
06x14,Wait... My last words with Marvin were lovely. I've been thinking about them a lot.,Judy
06x14,"Me, too. We went for a hike in the snow and had this amazing talk.",Marshall's brother  1
06x14,"My last day with Pop, he taught my son how to skate.",Marshall's brother  2
06x14,"Well, this is clearly yielding nothing. Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have to fill the time with some jokes... again.",Trey
06x14,"Last words seems like a good theme. Marshall, do you remember the last thing your father said to you?",Judy
06x14,"Bye, sweetie.",Judy
06x14,"Bye, Mom.",Marshall
06x14,"Son, there's something I want to say before I leave.",Marvin
06x14,"Yeah, Dad?",Marshall
06x14,Could I snag that extra pork chop for the flight?,Marvin
06x14,"I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Dad, don't they have food on the plane?",Marshall
06x14,"Yeah, but plane food is ass.",Marvin
06x14,"Plane food is ass. Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab so my dad called up from the street.",Marshall
06x14,Marshall! Looks like rain out here! I couldn't find an umbrella in your closet! You know who probably has an umbrella?,Marvin
06x14,"And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes - totally well-meaningly - he'd say stuff like...",Marshall
06x14,"The Koreans across the hall! Hey, the Koreans are a trustworthy and generous people!",Marvin
06x14,Dad...,Marshall
06x14,"I betcha one of the Koreans has an umbrella! Heck, they're Koreans!",Marvin
06x14,My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes.,Marshall
06x14,All that stuff was really nice!,Robin
06x14,Yeah! It's positive racism!,Lily
06x14,This is worse than the pork chop.,Marshall
06x14,"This next clip is entitled, Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull",Barney
06x14,Let's see what happens.,Ted
06x14,Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.,Barney
06x14,And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.,Ted
06x14,Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.,Barney
06x14,"No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there.",Marshall
06x14,"Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.",Marshall
06x14,Of course they did.,Marvin
06x14,"Bye, sweetie.",Judy
06x14,"Bye, Mom.",Marshall
06x14,"Hey, son, I just want to leave you with a little advice. Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night. It totally holds up!",Marvin
06x14,"Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that.  Oh, sorry, my phone's charged.",Marshall
06x14,"I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things.",Man
06x14,I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.,Robin
06x14,I need vodka and dirty playing cards.,Man
06x14,I got ya.,Robin
06x14,"Oh, my God.",Marshall
06x14,What is it?,Lily
06x14,I have a voice mail from my dad.,Marshall
06x14,You have a voice mail from your dad?,Lily
06x14,How?,Robin
06x14,"My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh...",Marshall
06x14,"Baby, are you okay?",Lily
06x14,I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play.,Marshall
06x14,What's wrong?,Robin
06x14,What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't... My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna...,Marshall
06x14,"Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me.",Lily
06x14,You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.,Robin
06x14,"She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?",Ted
06x14,"Exactly. All those famous last word people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?",Barney
06x14,My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.,Nathan Hale
06x14,You know what his real last words were?,Barney
06x14,I'm peeing my pants!,Nathan Hale
06x14,True story.,Barney
06x14,"The point is, last words are overrated.",Robin
06x14,"Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.",Ted
06x14,"I should go listen to this... alone, okay? I'll be back.",Marshall
06x14,"Hey, so, um, I heard you might have...",Woman
06x14,"You heard right.  I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here.",Robin
06x14,"Guys, listen to what just happened.",Lily
06x14,"Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while.",Lily
06x14,"You think your snobby New York cooking is better than mine-- admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't you just whip up a batch of your fancy tofu sushi bagels! And choke on them!",Judy
06x14,Whoa. Are you okay?,Ted
06x14,Listen!,Lily
06x14,I'm gonna go take a nap.,Judy
06x14,"Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!",Lily
06x14,"Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?",Ted
06x14,"Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now.",Lily
06x14,"Hey, stay hydrated.",Robin
06x14,So?,Barney
06x14,"I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard.",Marshall
06x14,"We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.",Lily
06x14,It doesn't. That's true.,Barney
06x14,"Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.",Marshall
06x14,"I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.",Ted
06x14,"Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg.",Ted's dad
06x14,Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our sx lives now. That's totally an improvement.,Ted
06x14,I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead.,Ted's dad
06x14,My prom date?!,Ted
06x14,"How far did you get, T-Dawg?",Ted's dad
06x14,I have to go.,Ted
06x14,How would you like those to be your father's last words?,Marshall
06x14,"Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.",Ted
06x14,Lawyered. Lily?,Marshall
06x14,Hello.,Lily
06x14,"Lily, it's Dad. Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying taxes for the last 25 years. ut bright side, I thought of a great new board game. Tax Evasion, ages six to ten. Which is, ironically, what I might be looking at. Anyway, Pumpkin, I need 15,000.",Lily's dad
06x14,Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep.,Lily
06x14,Lawyered. Robin?,Marshall
06x14,"And so, despite the endless disappointment you've caused me, I pray that this will finally be the year you achieve something of actual significance. I'd love to stop lying to my friends about you being in a coma. Anyway, the point is, happy birthday, RJ.",Robin's dad
06x14,That's awful.,Ted
06x14,"No, here's the awful part.",Robin
06x14,You remembered my birthday!,Robin
06x14,"Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal?",Marshall
06x14,Yes.,Everyone
06x14,"Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.",Barney
06x14,"Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute.",Marshall
06x14,"Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old.",Judy
06x14,"Whoa, they grow big out here.",Robin
06x14,And here's your phone number back.,Barney
06x14,"Judy, I...",Robin
06x14,I did it.,Lily
06x14,What possible excuse could you have for this?,Judy
06x14,I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.,Lily
06x14,"There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm!",Judy
06x14,"That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.",Lily
06x14,"Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.",Ted
06x14,Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.,Barney
06x14,Stupid.,Ted
06x14,What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.,Barney
06x14,Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit? So that's it? No discussion?,Ted
06x14,"I'm not going to listen. Rent Crocodile Dundee II are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.",Marshall
06x14,Is he laughing?,Ted
06x14,"Marshall really did think he could live with that. That is, until later, at the memorial service.",Ted from 2030
06x14,My last talk with Marvin was so lovely.,Judy
06x14,The stories his mother and brothers told were so perfect.,Ted from 2030
06x14,"Then he picked my crying son up off the ice. He gave him a hug and said, Champ, it doesn't matter if you fall down once in a while.",Marshall's brother  1
06x14,"And as we hiked, a little deer appeared on the path. She hopped over to Dad and started eating-- right out of his hand.",Marshall's brother  2
06x14,And then he kissed me and he said...,Judy
06x14,I will always be proud of you,Marshall's brother  1
06x14,Life is such a gift.,Marshall's brother  2
06x14,"You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive.",Judy
06x14,Lame.,Barney
06x14,These stories suck.,Ted
06x14,Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.,Robin
06x14,"You're up next, baby.",Lily
06x14,I just need some air.,Marshall
06x14,"Baby, are you okay?",Lily
06x14,I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing.,Marshall
06x14,"Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?",Lily
06x14,She's right. Your dad was hilarious.,Barney
06x14,"You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with?  But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?",Marshall
06x14,"Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound?  Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you.",Marvin's voice
06x14,Looks like your dad came through one last time.,Lily
06x14,I love you. My father's last words to me are I love you.,Marshall
06x14,"Ooh, and let me know if you find my foot cream. That fungus thing is acting up again.",Marvin's voice
06x14,I love you. My father's last words to me are I love you.,Marshall
06x14,"Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear.",Everyone
06x14,"Bye, Pop.",Marshall
06x14,"So Marshall finally got up to speak. Funny thing, though...",Ted from 2030
06x14,Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me: Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up.,Marshall
06x14,He decided to keep Marvin's real last words just for himself.,Ted from 2030
06x14,Thanks.,Judy
06x14,For what?,Lily
06x14,I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it.,Judy
06x14,Any time.,Lily
06x14,"That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one.",Judy
06x14,"Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.",Marshall
06x14,"Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?",Ted
06x14,"Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.",Marshall
06x14,"Last words-- it's a lot of pressure, kids.",Ted from 2030
06x14,"Hi, Dad.",Ted
06x14,"Hi, Dad.",Lily
06x14,"Hi, Dad.",Robin
06x14,"Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad.",Barney
06x15,"Kids, after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to stay home a while to take care of his mother.  But the longer he stayed there, the more it was like he had never left Minnesota.",Ted from 2030
06x15,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",Marshall
06x15,"Oh, that is too cute. Say it again.","Robin, laughing"
06x15,"No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.",Marshall
06x15,"There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.",Robin
06x15,"Kids, remember. Zoey had tried to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design. And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends. Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.",Ted from 2030
06x15,I thought the oven was Celsius.,Robin
06x15,It's okay. We got hot dogs.,Ted
06x15,"Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.",Lily
06x15,Could someone pass the ketchup?,Zoey
06x15,I hope I can pass this hot dog.,Barney
06x15,Oh.Oops.,Zoey
06x15,"Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.",Ted
06x15,"Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.",Zoey
06x15,Which is all gone.,Ted
06x15,"All right, I tell you what... you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three.",Zoey
06x15,"Hmm, tell you what... no dice.",Ted
06x15,I'll get the next hundred.,Zoey
06x15,You're not getting out of this.,Ted
06x15,You want to go on a date with my hot cousin?,Zoey
06x15,I'll get the ketchup.,Ted
06x15,"Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.",Marshall
06x15,"Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.",Robin
06x15,"Finally, Ted called her up.",Robin
06x15,Hello.,Zoey
06x15,"So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.",Ted
06x15,You still want to do that?,Zoey
06x15,Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,Ted
06x15,"Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.",Zoey
06x15,Cute means fat,Barney
06x15,She's not fat.,Zoey
06x15,Not fat means ugly,Barney
06x15,"Oh, here she is.",Zoey
06x15,I take back everything I said. That girl is extremely attractive.,Barney
06x15,"Hey, Zoey.",Honey
06x15,"Hey. Ted, this is my cousin...",Zoey
06x15,"Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name. None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as...",Ted from 2030
06x15,Honey.,Honey
06x15,"Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.",Ted
06x15,And here's why...,Ted from 2030
06x15,"She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, Oh, honey.",Robin
06x15,Interesting. Show your work.,Marshall
06x15,My apartment building is so safe. My landlord... he even installed a security camera in my shower.,Honey
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
06x15,"Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince.",Honey
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
06x15,I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends.,Honey
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
06x15,"Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.",Honey
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
06x15,"I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...",Robin
06x15,"Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.",Honey
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Barney
06x15,"So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.",Robin
06x15,"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.",Honey
06x15,Why do they call 'em coasters?,Barney
06x15,And Barney.,Robin
06x15,"Okay, time to go home.",Honey
06x15,"Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?",Barney
06x15,What are you talking about?,Ted
06x15,"Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.",Barney
06x15,What?,Ted
06x15,It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?,Barney
06x15,Mm-hmm.,Ted
06x15,"Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.",Barney
06x15,"You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.",Ted
06x15,"Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.",Robin
06x15,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",Ted
06x15,Hmm?,Robin
06x15,He's gay!,Judy
06x15,"Mom, hang up!",Marshall
06x15,I'm sorry.,Judy
06x15,Go on.,Marshall
06x15,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",Ted
06x15,Hmm?,Robin
06x15,I'm in love with Zoey.,Ted
06x15,"Oh, my God.",Marshall
06x15,"Oh, my God!",Judy
06x15,Mom!,Marshall
06x15,Sorry.,Judy
06x15,"Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.",Marshall
06x15,Funny you should say that.,Robin
06x15,Does anyone know why we're here?,Barney
06x15,"Yeah, who called this intervention?",Lily
06x15,I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.,Ted
06x15,Finally.,Lily
06x15,"Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.",Robin
06x15,"Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.",Barney
06x15,"It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.",Ted
06x15,Are you sure it's love?,Lily
06x15,"Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and... I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love.",Ted
06x15,Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next?,Marshall
06x15,"This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.",Ted
06x15,Isn't that a little harsh?,Robin
06x15,"Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.",Lily
06x15,"Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.",Robin
06x15,Then what am I supposed to do?,Ted
06x15,"Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.",Robin
06x15,Fine. I'll shut 'em down.,Ted
06x15,"And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.",Lily
06x15,"Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.",Marshall
06x15,So don't answer it.,Robin
06x15,Yeah.,Marshall
06x15,"Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota. You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude.","Robin, with a Minnesotan accent"
06x15,"Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",Marshall
06x15,"Hey, Marshall.",Barney
06x15,Barney. W- What number is this?,Marshall
06x15,"I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.",Barney
06x15,"Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.",Marshall
06x15,"Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.",Barney
06x15,"Hey, Zoey.",Honey
06x15,"Ted, this is my cousin...",Zoey
06x15,Honey.,Honey
06x15,Uh... Robin's version was...,Marshall
06x15,"That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.",Barney
06x15,"Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",Ted
06x15,"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.",Honey
06x15,"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...",Ted
06x15,Straw.,"Honey, whispering"
06x15,Coaster.,Barney
06x15,"Okay, time to go home.",Honey
06x15,"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.",Barney
06x15,Who's your daddy?,Barney
06x15,"Okay, can we skip this part, please?",Marshall
06x15,"Sure, I'll just summarize it.",Barney
06x15,"Okay, that's been going on a while.",Marshall
06x15,"Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.",Barney
06x15,"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.",Barney
06x15,Thanks.,Zoey
06x15,"Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...",Barney
06x15,"Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?",Zoey
06x15,"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize...",Barney
06x15,She hugged me. What was that all about?,Barney
06x15,Zoey's in love with Ted.,Marcus
06x15,Marcus!,Marshall
06x15,"Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.",Marcus
06x15,Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.,Marshall
06x15,"Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut?",Marcus
06x15,"Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!",Marshall
06x15,"Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.",Marcus
06x15,"So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.",Marshall
06x15,Hello.,Ted
06x15,"Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.",Marshall
06x15,"Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.",Ted
06x15,Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.,Zoey
06x15,Can I get you a beer?,Ted
06x15,"Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way.",Zoey
06x15,"Oh, my God.","Ted, laughing"
06x15,"What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What?",Zoey
06x15,"Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...",Ted
06x15,"Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?",Judy
06x15,Mom! Get off the phone!,Marshall
06x15,"Could you get some more Bugles, please?",Marcus
06x15,"Of course, dear.",Judy
06x15,"Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on.",Marshall
06x15,"I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.",Ted
06x15,Wow. Okay.,Zoey
06x15,And that was it. No more Zoey.,Ted
06x15,"Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.",Marshall
06x15,We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.,Lily
06x15,"Ted's a son of a bitch!  Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.",Marshall
06x15,"Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?",Lily
06x15,"I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.",Ted
06x15,Why?,Zoey
06x15,Lily hates you.,Ted
06x15,You hate me?,Zoey
06x15,That's crazy. I don't hate you.,Lily
06x15,"Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.",Zoey
06x15,"He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?",Lily
06x15,Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.,Ted
06x15,"Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.",Lily
06x15,I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.,Zoey
06x15,Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?,Marshall
06x15,I don't know.,Lily
06x15,"Well, you did the right thing, baby.",Marshall
06x15,Not entirely.,Lily
06x15,"Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.",Lily
06x15,And that's Robin on the other line.,Marshall
06x15,"Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!",Lily
06x15,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...",Marshall
06x15,"Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.",Robin
06x15,Me? You dragged me into this?!,Marshall
06x15,You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...,Robin
06x15,"Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!",Marshall
06x15,Just don't answer it.,Robin
06x15,I can't not answer. It's impolite.,Marshall
06x15,"Marshall, you can beat this.",Robin
06x15,I can't turn my back on politeness.,Marshall
06x15,You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.,Robin
06x15,Good manners are what separate us from those elbows on the table Wisconsinites.,Marshall
06x15,"You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!",Robin
06x15,"I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.",Marshall
06x15,"Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first.",Honey
06x15,"Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.",Marshall
06x15,Hi.,Honey
06x15,"Listen, um, about Barney...",Marshall
06x15,"Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.",Honey
06x15,Who's your daddy?,Barney
06x15,Oh... Who's your daddy?,"Honey, giggling"
06x15,I don't know.,Barney
06x15,I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.,Honey
06x15,So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.,Barney
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Honey
06x15,"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.",Barney
06x15,"Oh, honey.",Honey
06x15,"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.",Barney
06x15,"Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.",Honey
06x15,Four. Four Nobel Prizes.,Barney
06x15,"Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?",Honey
06x15,Only three.,Barney
06x15,"Well, there you go.",Honey
06x15,"Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?",Marshall
06x15,"Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.",Honey
06x15,I am her therapist.,Marshall
06x15,"Oh! Well, in that case...",Honey
06x15,"Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!",Marshall
06x15,What's this really about?,Zoey
06x15,I told you. Lily hates you.,Ted
06x15,"I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.",Zoey
06x15,All right. Yes. I... hate you.,Ted
06x15,Great. See? Was that so hard?,Zoey
06x15,Zoey.,Ted
06x15,"Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.",Zoey
06x15,"So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?",Marshall
06x15,Zoey's in love with...,Marcus
06x15,"Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...",Marshall
06x15,And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,Ted
06x15,"Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.",Zoey
06x15,Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?,Marshall
06x15,"So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.",Marcus
06x15,Give me that phone.,Marshall
06x15,"Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph?  Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.",Ted
06x15,"Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye.",Zoey
06x15,Why was Marshall calling?,Ted
06x15,Don't worry about it. Go on.,Zoey
06x15,"You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.",Ted
06x15,"Well, actually...",Zoey
06x15,You're a show-off.,Ted
06x15,You better take that.,Zoey
06x15,"Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.",Ted
06x15,They're kissing.,Neighbour
06x15,They're kissing?! Yeah!  They're kissing!,Marshall
06x16,"My first kiss with Zoey was amazing, and complicated.",Ted from 2030
06x16,"Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.",Ted
06x16,Someone knows how to set a mood.,Zoey
06x16,I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.,Ted
06x16,"My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.",Ted from 2030
06x16,"You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.",Barney
06x16,"Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.",Ted
06x16,Oh. Translation: booty-call.,Robin
06x16,Total booty-call.,Barney
06x16,"Private Booty, reporting for duty.",Lily
06x16,That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.,Ted
06x16,"Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, What ya doing? But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.",Robin
06x16,"It's called class, Ted.",Lily
06x16,Wait. That... You think that's what she means by baking cookies?,Ted
06x16,"Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, Stop, Marshall, stop, but that's just code for harder!",Lily
06x16,"Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?",Ted
06x16,So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.,Lily
06x16,"I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle.",Ted from 2030
06x16,"You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.",Marshall
06x16,I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.,Lily
06x16,What girls?,Marshall
06x16,"If it bleeds, we can kll it.",ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER
06x16,Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.,Ted from 2030
06x16,"Wow, you sound really lonely.",Barney
06x16,"I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...",Lily
06x16,"Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.",Barney
06x16,That's not a thing.,Robin
06x16,"It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",Barney
06x16,That's actually true.,Ted
06x16,"Wait, there's more.",Barney
06x16,This won't be.,Ted
06x16,"And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.",Barney
06x16,Whoa. Check out that one. Her body is a perfect X.,Saint Desperatius
06x16,"Player, play on. High V.",Saint Valentine
06x16,"Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? 15 and still unmarried.",Woman
06x16,And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.,Saint Desperatius
06x16,"Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.",Barney
06x16,Please say widows.,Robin
06x16,"Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.",Barney
06x16,"Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...",Robin
06x16,Trolls.,Barney
06x16,...who could care less about Valentine's Day.,Robin
06x16,Lying trolls.,Barney
06x16,"And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.",Robin
06x16,And none was taken until just then.,Ted
06x16,I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,Lily
06x16,"You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?",Barney
06x16,I'm getting weird!,Lily
06x16,"See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.",Lily
06x16,I call him Marshpillow. And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.,Lily
06x16,Hey. How was baking cookies last night?,Robin
06x16,That was a tough question. You see...,Ted from 2030
06x16,Uh... Is that an overnight bag?,Zoey
06x16,You brought an overnight bag?,Lily
06x16,You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.,Ted
06x16,"We said you were going to have sx. We didn't say, Bring a carry-on.",Barney
06x16,So how did Zoey react?,Robin
06x16,She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.,Ted
06x16,Were there slippers for the morning?,Robin
06x16,"Not slippers, exactly.",Ted
06x16,They're called British morning socks.,Ted
06x16,This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy.,Judy
06x16,"How are you holding up, Judy?",Lily
06x16,"Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but... I'm not a lunatic.",Judy
06x16,"Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?",Marshall
06x16,I wanted to surprise you.,Lily
06x16,"Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",Marshall
06x16,"Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes.",Judy
06x16,"Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.",Marshall
06x16,"Aw... Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you.",Judy
06x16,I thought he was here helping you.,Lily
06x16,"Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...",Judy
06x16,"Uh, I'll talk to him.",Lily
06x16,"I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.",Judy
06x16,"Oh, God.",Lily
06x16,"There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?",Judy
06x16,"Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...",Ted
06x16,"No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to bake cookies. We both knew what that meant.",Zoey
06x16,We totally did.,Ted
06x16,"I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, Am I ready for this? And... the answer is yes.",Zoey
06x16,They're actually called British morning socks.,Ted
06x16,Yeah. Don't get in your own way.,Zoey
06x16,Right. Okay.,Ted
06x16,"Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.",Lily
06x16,"My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!",Marshall
06x16,Oops. Comin' right up!,Judy
06x16,She needs this.,"Marshall, whispers"
06x16,"Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?",Lily
06x16,"Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.",Marshall
06x16,"Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.",Lily
06x16,What?,Marshall
06x16,"Anything else, sweetie?",Judy
06x16,"Mom, d-do you want me to leave?",Marshall
06x16,"Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not!",Judy
06x16,"But, Judy, you said...",Lily
06x16,"Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.",Judy
06x16,So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.,Zoey
06x16,"Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.",Ted
06x16,"I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you.",Zoey
06x16,"Tomorrow night, my place.",Ted
06x16,"I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years.",Zoey
06x16,Isn't that great?,Ted
06x16,"Yeah, if you say so, yeah.",Robin
06x16,What do you mean?,Ted
06x16,"Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.",Robin
06x16,"Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.",Ted
06x16,"See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.",Robin
06x16,"Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!",Ted
06x16,"Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next.",Ted from 2030
06x16,Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.,Ted
06x16,"Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night...",Ted from 2030
06x16,"God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.",Barney
06x16,"Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.",Robin
06x16,Enchant. That's French for What's with the purple?,Barney
06x16,"Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.",Robin
06x16,"I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea.",Bev
06x16,"Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens.",Anna
06x16,"And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.",Robin
06x16,Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your fianc who no one's ever met.,Barney
06x16,Gerard is real!,Bev
06x16,Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.,Lily
06x16,"Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!",Ted
06x16,Is orange juice okay?,Judy
06x16,No!,Ted  Marshall
06x16,"Okay, when your fianc Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.",Barney
06x16,"Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so...",Bev
06x16,"Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.",Nora
06x16,"Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?",Robin
06x16,My elbow slipped!,Barney
06x16,"Marshall, I'm going home.",Lily
06x16,What?,Marshall
06x16,"I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.",Lily
06x16,"I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.",Marshall
06x16,While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...,Lily
06x16,You have Super Mario Kart?!,Ted
06x16,"Hell, yeah.",Marshall
06x16,But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.,Lily
06x16,"Baby, don't go.",Marshall
06x16,Please come home soon.,Lily
06x16,"So, you were an Olympic gymnast?",Barney
06x16,Silver medal.,Woman
06x16,"Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.",Barney
06x16,That's what my dad said.,Woman
06x16,"And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.",Barney
06x16,"Oh, hi.",Nora
06x16,Quick question.,Barney
06x16,Yeah.,Nora
06x16,Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,Barney
06x16,"Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?",Nora
06x16,Sure.,Barney
06x16,I love Valentine's Day.,Nora
06x16,"Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?",Barney
06x16,"Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?",Nora
06x16,"Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?",Barney
06x16,We are pitiful.,Nora
06x16,The worst.,Barney
06x16,Although there is one difference between you and me.,Nora
06x16,What's that?,Barney
06x16,I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.,Nora
06x16,"I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.",Marshall
06x16,I know.,Ted
06x16,"Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",Marshall
06x16,"All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",Barney
06x16,"What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?",Nora
06x16,"Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",Barney
06x16,I have no idea what any of those words mean.,Nora
06x16,"Hey, I'm all stretched out!",Woman
06x16,Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.,Barney
06x16,"Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.",Marshall
06x16,Yeah.,Ted
06x16,"Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?",Marshall
06x16,"Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.",Ted
06x16,What?,Marshall
06x16,"Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",Ted
06x16,"You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",Marshall
06x16,We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,Ted
06x16,"So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?",Marshall
06x16,Crusts cut off.,Ted
06x16,"Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.",Marshall
06x16,...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.,Barney
06x16,Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!,Nora
06x16,"Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.",Barney
06x16,"Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.",Robin
06x16,Where are Bev and Anna?,Nora
06x16,Well...,Robin
06x16,"So, we're taking off.",Bev
06x16,What?,Robin
06x16,Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.,Anna
06x16,"What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",Robin
06x16,But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.,Bev
06x16,I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,Robin
06x16,"Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.",Anna
06x16,"I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.",Barney
06x16,"Well, I think I'm heading out, too.",Nora
06x16,"What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!",Barney
06x16,"It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.",Nora
06x16,Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,Robin
06x16,What are you talking about?,Barney
06x16,"Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",Robin
06x16,"No, I don't. She's gross.",Barney
06x16,Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,Robin
06x16,Whatever you say.,Barney
06x16,"Oh, hey, Nora.",Robin
06x16,Nora...,Barney
06x16,"Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha.",MARVIN
06x16,"And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except...",Ted from 2030
06x16,Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.,Zoey
06x16,"Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",Ted
06x16,"The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",Barney
06x16,"Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.",Robin
06x16,Hap...?,Barney
06x16,"Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here.",Nora
06x16,"And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.",Ted from 2030
06x16,Oh!,Barney
06x16,You will be avenged.,Nora
06x16,Come on! Come on! kll me! I'm here! kll me!,SCHWARZENEGGER 
06x16,"Baby, you're back.",Lily
06x16,"Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.",Marshall
06x16,We both knew this would end eventually.,Lily
06x17,"Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.",Ted from 2030
06x17,"Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?",Ted
06x17,"Hey, Ted.",Wendy
06x17,Hey... There she is. Wow.,Ted
06x17,Wendy the Waitress.,Wendy
06x17,Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?,Ted
06x17,"What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years.",Ted from 2030
06x17,"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.",Robin
06x17,I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,Barney
06x17,Not according to her.,Robin
06x17,"Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.",Nora
06x17,You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
06x17,"No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.",Nora
06x17,Absolutely.,Barney
06x17,How is that a disaster?,Robin
06x17,"She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...",Barney
06x17,You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
06x17,"No, I'm kind of tired.",Nora
06x17,Absolutely.,Barney
06x17,"It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.",Barney
06x17,"Please, Cheese. You like this girl.",Robin
06x17,"What? Nora? No, I don't.",Barney
06x17,"Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.",Robin
06x17,"That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?",Barney
06x17,You like her. You should call her.,Robin
06x17,"Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.",Barney
06x17,"That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.",Robin
06x17,Totally.,Barney
06x17,"Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?",Ted from 2030
06x17,"Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...",Woman
06x17,"No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",Ted
06x17,"Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.",Ted
06x17,"Oh, man, this movie is scary.",Zoey
06x17,"I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",Ted
06x17,"Actually, I said, How's your meat?",Woman
06x17,Oh. A little cold.,Ted
06x17,"Gee, wonder why.",Woman
06x17,"Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?",Zoey
06x17,"Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.",Ted
06x17,You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.,Zoey
06x17,"If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.",Ted
06x17,"All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.",Marshall
06x17,I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.,Ted
06x17,"Yeah, he's been really... quiet.",Lily
06x17,"Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.",Robin
06x17,Like Prince.,Barney
06x17,"No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.",Lily
06x17,Oh. Ha-wink,Barney
06x17,Excuse me?,Lily
06x17,"Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.",Barney
06x17,It's been a while.,Lily
06x17,"Five weeks, three days by my estimation.",Barney
06x17,You should work at a carnival.,Lily
06x17,I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.,Barney
06x17,"Anyway, we should get going.",Ted
06x17,"Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.",Lily
06x17,"Good night. Good night, guys.",Robin
06x17,18 weeks.,Barney
06x17,"Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...",Robin
06x17,"Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.",Barney
06x17,Throw me one? Yeah.,Robin
06x17,We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.,Barney
06x17,"Oh, I see what's going on.",Robin
06x17,Yeah?,Barney
06x17,"This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.",Robin
06x17,"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?",Barney
06x17,Nora met a guy. What?!,Robin
06x17,What?,Barney
06x17,Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,Robin
06x17,"But L'Amour means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",Barney
06x17,"Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",Lily
06x17,I can't sleep.,Marshall
06x17,Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?,Lily
06x17,Maybe after this documentary on garbage.,Marshall
06x17,"Man, I am losing my touch.",Lily
06x17,"Nearly twice the size of Texas, the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch, or Garbage Island, is an enviwonmental disaster. Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack. Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do.",Tv
06x17,I have to save the planet!,Marshall
06x17,Is it over? I call on top.,Lily
06x17,"A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box.",Ted from 2030
06x17,I'm here to...,Ted
06x17,Ted. What a surprise. Ted.,Captain
06x17,Captain. I...,Ted
06x17,You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.,Captain
06x17,"Pssh, nah...",Ted
06x17,"But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study.",Captain
06x17,Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!,Marshall
06x17,"In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...",Robin
06x17,"Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one: the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.",Marshall
06x17,That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out.,Wendy
06x17,You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only 12 million.,Marshall
06x17,"Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is 12 million, and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.",Barney
06x17,"Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.",Ted
06x17,"Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.",Captain
06x17,Wow.,Ted
06x17,Do you have any idea who it could be?,Captain
06x17,The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true.,Ted from 2030
06x17,"Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.",Captain
06x17,Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,Ted
06x17,"Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.",Captain
06x17,And that's the last time you saw her.,Ted
06x17,"But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.",Captain
06x17,That's damn good brandy.,Ted
06x17,"But morning came, and she was gone.",Captain
06x17,"Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.",Ted
06x17,I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.,Captain
06x17,Me. I'm the bad guy.,Ted
06x17,"Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",Robin
06x17,Damn it! The box!,Ted
06x17,"Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",Marshall
06x17,"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.",Lily
06x17,"Okay, why not: from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that.",Marshall
06x17,"Deal. Come on, come on.",Lily
06x17,Lily!,Marshall
06x17,"You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.",Barney
06x17,Sorry. Who said anything about an...?,Robin
06x17,"Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",Barney
06x17,"No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",Robin
06x17,"No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",Barney
06x17,"You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",Robin
06x17,"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.",Barney
06x17,"Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",Robin
06x17,Sorry?,Barney
06x17,"I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",Robin
06x17,"Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",Barney
06x17,"Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",Robin
06x17,"Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",Barney
06x17,"sx now, we'll do the foreplay after.",Lily
06x17,"Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.",Marshall
06x17,"The green initiative, for only 12 million, will change the way...",Marshall
06x17,"Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting.",Arthur
06x17,You did meet Sting.,Man
06x17,"Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another 12 million?",Arthur
06x17,"Well, because we can always do more.",Marshall
06x17,"Yeah, but I met Sting.",Arthur
06x17,"Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",Marshall
06x17,Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?,Arthur
06x17,"Well, he has some good points.",Meeker
06x17,"Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen...",Arthur
06x17,His father just died.,Man
06x17,...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.,Arthur
06x17,Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,Marshall
06x17,"No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",Lily
06x17,"Hey, baby.",Marshall
06x17,Yeah?,Lily
06x17,What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,Marshall
06x17,"Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",Lily
06x17,"Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",Marshall
06x17,"Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",Lily
06x17,"Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",Marshall
06x17,Cwap.,Lily
06x17,"Hi, I'm here to pick up...",Ted
06x17,"Hello, Ted.",Captain
06x17,To the study?,Ted
06x17,To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.,Captain
06x17,Know what?,Ted
06x17,"I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!",Captain
06x17,That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,Ted
06x17,"He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!",Captain
06x17,"No, no, no, you can't fire him.",Ted
06x17,You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!,Captain
06x17,"Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",Ted
06x17,"Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!",Captain
06x17,"Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",Ted
06x17,"Whoa, rapscallion may be going a bit far, Ted.",Captain
06x17,"But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",Ted
06x17,"Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?",Captain
06x17,Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,Ted
06x17,"When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.",Captain
06x17,"Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",Ted
06x17,"It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.",Captain
06x17,It's me. You're welcome.,Ted
06x17,"Okay, baby, what gives?",Lily
06x17,"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",Marshall
06x17,I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,Lily
06x17,"All right, Robin, give it to me.",Barney
06x17,"Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, Yeah, Barney, go get her! But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",Robin
06x17,"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",Barney
06x17,"It's a five, idiot.",Robin
06x17,A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,Barney
06x17,Moon man language? What does that even mean?,Robin
06x17,How am I supposed to see that's a five?,Barney
06x17,Look how you taped this up...,Robin
06x17,"Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",Barney
06x17,Barney. Go get her.,Robin
06x17,"Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",Ted
06x17,"Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.",Zoey
06x17,So I'm the bad guy. Great.,Ted
06x17,"Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.",Zoey
06x17,If you say so.,Ted
06x17,"I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.",Zoey
06x17,"Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",Lily
06x17,He'll never get to see how I turn out.,Marshall
06x17,What do you mean?,Lily
06x17,"My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",Marshall
06x17,Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,Lily
06x17,"Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",Marshall
06x17,"Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",Lily
06x17,"I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",Marshall
06x17,Meeker doesn't hate you.,Lily
06x17,"Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...",Ted from 2030
06x17,Are you guys...?,Meeker
06x17,Closed. Sorry. Thanks.,Wendy
06x17,Rough night?,Meeker
06x17,Yeah.,Wendy
06x17,I'm sorry.,Meeker
06x17,It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.,Wendy
06x17,What did you just say?,Meeker
06x17,"Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?",Wendy
06x17,Know him? I hate that guy.,Meeker
06x17,"Me, too.",Wendy
06x17,"Well, hey.",Meeker
06x17,"And the rest, as they say...is history.",Ted from 2030
06x17,"And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.",Wendy
06x17,Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.,Ted
06x17,"Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?",Wendy
06x17,"No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",Ted
06x17,"Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.",Wendy
06x17,"Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you.  Hello. Marshall.",Ted
06x17,"Hey, Ted.",Marshall
06x17,Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.,Ted
06x18,"Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.",Ted from 2030
06x18,"I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple sx partners. I'm doing everything right.",Barney
06x18,"Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",Ted
06x18,"Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.",Robin
06x18,"Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?",Lily
06x18,"No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.",Ted
06x18,You wouldn't have to take care of it.,Robin
06x18,Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?,Ted
06x18,"Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",Robin
06x18,"Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",Marshall
06x18,Here we go.,Robin
06x18,"You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",Marshall
06x18,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. With? I am not with Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",Barney
06x18,I don't know. This will be your second date.,Robin
06x18,"Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",Lily
06x18,"Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...",Barney
06x18,Barney said this a lot.,Ted from 2030
06x18,"If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day  ...  Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers  ...  Never date a girl with a hook for a hand  ...",Barney
06x18,Never go out with the same girl more than once.,Barney
06x18,Then why are you going out with Nora again?,Lily
06x18,There is an exception.,Barney
06x18,And it was always the same exception.,Ted from 2030
06x18,...unless she's hot  ... ...unless she's hot  ... ...unless she's hot.,Barney
06x18,"And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it.",Barney
06x18,"Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",Barney
06x18,"Oh, no. How long have you been sick?",Nora
06x18,About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.,Barney
06x18,"Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...",Nora
06x18,Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?,Barney
06x18,"Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.",Nora
06x18,The bed... that's where all the...happens.,Barney
06x18,"Come on, let's get you sorted out.",Nora
06x18,"That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.",Ted from 2030
06x18,Ah. Thank you.,Barney
06x18,"Good night, Barney.",Nora
06x18,"Good night, Mommy.",Barney
06x18,"Wow, she nursed you back to health?",Lily
06x18,No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.,Barney
06x18,"Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.",Robin
06x18,"What's up. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john.",Nate
06x18,"Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.",Ted
06x18,"Thanks, brah. I like you guys.",Nate
06x18,"Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.",Marshall
06x18,What? You told me to meet someone.,Robin
06x18,"I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",Marshall
06x18,"Actually, I met him in the park.",Robin
06x18,Should have just let you get a dog.,Ted
06x18,"Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",Barney
06x18,"Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?",Lily
06x18,No.,Barney
06x18,Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?,Lily
06x18,Yes!,Barney
06x18,"Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.",Lily
06x18,"Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang. Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang",Barney
06x18,"Bang, bang, bangity bang...",Barney
06x18,Are we done?,The cardiologist
06x18,"A bang-bang, bangity-bang.",Barney
06x18,"Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.",The cardiologist
06x18,"See, Lily? She was worried.",Barney
06x18,Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.,The cardiologist
06x18,"Ow! Nails, nails!",Lily
06x18,"It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.",The cardiologist
06x18,"Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.",Barney
06x18,Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.,The cardiologist
06x18,"Well, now it doesn't.",Barney
06x18,"And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.",Ted from 2030
06x18,"Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.",The cardiologist
06x18,"Go on, Doctor.",Barney
06x18,What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?,The cardiologist
06x18,"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",Barney
06x18,"This might be a little forward, but do you have a bmb strapped to your chest?",Nora
06x18,"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",Barney
06x18,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.",Nora
06x18,What's that like?,Barney
06x18,So is everything okay?,Nora
06x18,"My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.",Barney
06x18,"Oh, I am so sorry.",Nora
06x18,Thanks.,Barney
06x18,"Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.",Nora
06x18,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",Barney
06x18,"I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.",Nora
06x18,You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!,Lily
06x18,"That's exactly what I want, too.",Barney
06x18,"I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, get out of here! And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, get out of here! So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back.",Nate
06x18,"Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.",Robin
06x18,"Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.",Marshall
06x18,And what is he?,Robin
06x18,He's a dog.,Marshall
06x18,He's totally a dog.,Ted
06x18,What? You saw him hitting on someone?,Robin
06x18,"No, I didn't say, He a dawg. I said, He's a dog. As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",Marshall
06x18,"Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.",Ted
06x18,Where?,Nate
06x18,"Okay, Scooby, you ready?",Marshall
06x18,Good boy!,Ted
06x18,That last one did not happen.,Robin
06x18,"Okay, you're right. He dropped it.",Marshall
06x18,He's not a dog.,Robin
06x18,"Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.",Ted
06x18,"Hey, guys, got my shots.",Nate
06x18,You are so playful.,Marshall
06x18,Nice job fetching those.,Ted
06x18,"Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.",Lily
06x18,"So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.",Marshall
06x18,"Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you paws.",Ted
06x18,How did you meet?,Lily
06x18,Tell us the tail,Marshall
06x18,"Yes, how did you whisker off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.",Ted
06x18,"Did you send her an e-mail, or did you collar?",Lily
06x18,"Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.",Robin
06x18,"No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to flea.",Marshall
06x18,We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.,Lily
06x18,"So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ruff.",Ted
06x18,Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York.,Nate
06x18,"Oh, I bet it was an Incredible Journey",Lily
06x18,What part of Canada is that? Speak.,Marshall
06x18,Labrador.,Nate
06x18,This isn't happening.,Lily
06x18,"Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.",Robin
06x18,"No, I'm good.",Nate
06x18,"Oh, sht, dropped my keys.",Robin
06x18,I'll get 'em.,Nate
06x18,"Hey, guys, this is Nora.",Barney
06x18,"We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.",Nora
06x18,"Well, it's still early.",Robin
06x18,"I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic.",Nora
06x18,I had no idea he had a deep down.,Lily
06x18,"Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.",Nora
06x18,"I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.",Barney
06x18,How many do you want?,Nora
06x18,Three... one of each. You?,Barney
06x18,Three. All in an old stone house.,Nora
06x18,"Yeah, with ivy growing on it.",Barney
06x18,And we must have a pool.,Barney
06x18,"We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?",Nora
06x18,I really am.,Barney
06x18,Unbelievable.,Robin
06x18,"I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.",Nora
06x18,"I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...",Barney
06x18,And that explains your 14-second cardiac arrest.,The cardiologist
06x18,"Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.",Lily
06x18,"I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.",Barney
06x18,"I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.",Lily
06x18,"Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.",Marshall
06x18,"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.",Barney
06x18,"Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.",Lily
06x18,"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?",Barney
06x18,"Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.",Lily
06x18,Marshall?,Barney
06x18,You got nothing on me.,Marshall
06x18,The calzone?,Barney
06x18,Checkmate.,Marshall
06x18,Robin.,Barney
06x18,"Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...",Robin
06x18,The Mr. T dream...,Barney
06x18,I'm lost.,Robin
06x18,Ted?,Barney
06x18,Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.,Ted
06x18,The ballet class.,Barney
06x18,I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.,Ted
06x18,The 'N Sync concert.,Barney
06x18,"1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?",Ted
06x18,"Okay, Ted. The thermos.",Barney
06x18,I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.,Ted
06x18,I do! So be cool!,Barney
06x18,There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.,Nora
06x18,"Sorry, toots. He's taken.",Robin
06x18,So. How do you all know Barney?,Nora
06x18,"Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me.",Lily
06x18,"We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs.",Marshall
06x18,"Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once.",Nora
06x18,Once?,Ted
06x18,Thermos.,Barney
06x18,Nope. Not even once.,Ted
06x18,Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy.,Nora
06x18,I don't recall.,Lily
06x18,"Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?",Marshall
06x18,"It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?",Nora
06x18,This was a big deal for Barney.,Ted from 2030
06x18,"I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.",Barney
06x18,Not even if she's hot?,Ted
06x18,Not even if her mom's hot.,Barney
06x18,I'd love to meet your parents.,Barney
06x18,"It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?",Nora
06x18,Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.,Nate
06x18,"No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!",Barney
06x18,"Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.",Robin
06x18,"I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.",Ted
06x18,He's not a... Good night.,Robin
06x18,"What do we do now? Oh! I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of...",Nate
06x18,"Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches.",Ted from 2030
06x18,Whoa. Put that away.,Marshall
06x18,You guys want to fire these up?,Nate
06x18,"Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.",Lily
06x18,Sandwich brownies?,Ted
06x18,Okay.,Nate
06x18,Sandwiches make me hungry.,Marshall
06x18,Truth. Hey. I have a question.,Ted
06x18,Yeah?,Marshall
06x18,What did Barney mean when he said calzone?,Ted
06x18,"Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...",Marshall
06x18,Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.,Ted
06x18,"Guys, I found this on the floor.",Lily
06x18,"Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?",Ted
06x18,Scooby got out!,Lily
06x18,Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.,Nora
06x18,"Yeah, me, too.",Barney
06x18,Do you want to come upstairs?,Nora
06x18,"I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.",Barney
06x18,Can you believe...,Barney
06x18,"Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.",Lily
06x18,"Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.",Marshall
06x18,"Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby? Uh, well, he got out.","Ted, on the phone with Robin"
06x18,Got out? What do you mean?,Robin
06x18,He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.,Ted
06x18,It wasn't me.,Marshall
06x18,Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.,Lily
06x18,He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.,Ted
06x18,I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.,Marshall
06x18,Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.,Robin
06x18,Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,Ted
06x18,"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",Barney
06x18,Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!,Nora
06x18,I was on the spot. This is your fault.,Barney
06x18,My fault?,Nora
06x18,"Yeah, with the whole I want to get married thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",Barney
06x18,"Good-bye, Barney.",Nora
06x18,Great idea.,Ted
06x18,"No, great idea!",Marshall
06x18,"Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?",Lily
06x18,Of course. Back to the pizza place!,Marshall
06x18,Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.,Ted
06x18,Who's Scooby?,Marshall
06x18,"Hey, have you seen Scooby?",Robin
06x18,"Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?",Barney
06x18,Scooby!,Marshall
06x18,"Oh, hey! It's my friends!",Nate
06x18,"And that explains 12:51 a.m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you.",The cardiologist
06x18,Day's not over.,Lily
06x18,"Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.",Barney
06x18,"No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.",Lily
06x18,"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...",Barney
06x18,What time was your dinner reservation?,Lily
06x18,Last night? 8:30.,Barney
06x18,What did his heart do at 8:30? It... literally skipped a beat.,The cardiologist
06x18,"Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.",Lily
06x18,I lied.,Barney
06x18,Barney.,Nora
06x18,"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.",Barney
06x18,I'm confused.,Nora
06x18,"So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.",Barney
06x18,"Mom, Dad... this is Barney.",Nora
06x18,"Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
06x19,"Kids, I bought the house we live in now way back before I ever met your mother. It needed a lot of work, but I had a vision for it.",Ted from 2030
06x19,"Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.",Ted
06x19,"Ted. This is your seduction lounge. sx swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...",Barney
06x19,"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.",Marshall
06x19,We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,Lily
06x19,"Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",Barney
06x19,Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you,Ted
06x19,Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier.,Ted from 2030
06x19,"Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.",Marshall
06x19,"Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?",Ted
06x19,"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.",Barney
06x19,You call the super for a screwdriver?,Lily
06x19,"Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",Barney
06x19,"Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.",Ted
06x19,"Well, here's our screwdriver now.  Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.",Barney
06x19,"Barney, I... I got your letter.",Jerry
06x19,Dad?,Barney
06x19,I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.,Marshall
06x19,"Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?",Robin
06x19,"So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls?",Lily
06x19,"Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.",Ted
06x19,"Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.",Robin
06x19,"Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.",Ted
06x19,Really? I seem to recall...,Robin
06x19,Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.,Ted
06x19,"Um, Professor? Uh, do you mean chameleon?",Student
06x19,"Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced chamma-leeon, so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.",Ted
06x19,"Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",Ted
06x19,"Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ch-aracter to admit that.",Robin
06x19,"Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.",Ted
06x19,You want to tussle? Let's tussle.,Robin
06x19,Marine biologist.,Ted
06x19,"Please, no.",Robin
06x19,"So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months.",Scott
06x19,"Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.",Robin
06x19,"Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...",Scott
06x19,"Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!",Robin
06x19,"Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right?",Scott
06x19,So... you want to get pizza later? Or...,Robin
06x19,I think we should break up.,Scott
06x19,I still think about him in the shower.,Robin
06x19,"Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",Ted
06x19,Where do I begin?,Barney
06x19,"So, I'm not sure how to start this.",Jerry 
06x19,Yeah. I think I need a drink.,Barney
06x19,"Me, too.",Jerry
06x19,"Glen McKenna, neat.",Both
06x19,Nice order. Up top.,Jerry
06x19,"Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",Barney
06x19,"Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?",Jerry
06x19,"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.",Barney
06x19,Make a muscle.,Barney
06x19,There you go.,Jerry
06x19,Ah!,Barney
06x19,"Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",Barney
06x19,"Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?",Barney
06x19,"Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.",Jerry
06x19,You're funny. My dad's funny.,Barney
06x19,"So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",Barney
06x19,Why did you abandon me?,Lily
06x19,Why'd you wait so long to contact me?,Marshall
06x19,"You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",Robin
06x19,Do you... get laid a lot?,Barney
06x19,Big-time. Observe.,Jerry
06x19,"Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",Barney
06x19,"Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.",Jerry
06x19,You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,Barney
06x19,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",Barney
06x19,So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.,Jerry
06x19,"Oh, that's cool.",Barney
06x19,"Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?",Jerry
06x19,This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg.,Barney
06x19,"Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",Lily
06x19,What do you mean?,Barney
06x19,"Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.",Ted
06x19,"Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.",Robin
06x19,"First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",Barney
06x19,"I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?",Ted
06x19,Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.,Lily
06x19,"You have gaps, too, Lily.",Ted
06x19,You got nothing on me.,Lily
06x19,"Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?",Marshall
06x19,"Sure, honey.",Lily
06x19,You have terrible aim.,Ted
06x19,That's not true.,Lily
06x19,"Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.",Marshall
06x19,"Oh, my God. Barney's dad.",Robin
06x19,"Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?",Jerry
06x19,"Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?",Marshall
06x19,"What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls.",Jerry
06x19,"What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.",Lily
06x19,That's not what happened.,Jerry
06x19,I'm not sure how to start this.,Barney
06x19,Yeah.,Jerry
06x19,I think I need a drink.,Barney
06x19,"Me, too.",Jerry
06x19,"Glen McKenna, neat.",Barney
06x19,"Milk, skim.",Jerry
06x19,"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",Barney
06x19,"I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.",Jerry
06x19,Wow.,Barney
06x19,"I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.",Jerry
06x19,"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",Barney
06x19,"No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right",Jerry
06x19,"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",Barney
06x19,"Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.",Jerry
06x19,"Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.",Barney
06x19,"The drugs, the alcohol, the women...",Jerry
06x19,"Yes, yes, yes.",Barney
06x19,I was out of control.,Jerry
06x19,Out of control.,Barney
06x19,"So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.",Jerry
06x19,You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,Barney
06x19,Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.,Jerry
06x19,"I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word furgling. It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, More quiche! More quiche! I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.",Jerry
06x19,"I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...",Jerry
06x19,"What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.",Jerry
06x19,Big-time.,Barney
06x19,"Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",Jerry
06x19,"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the Father Knows Breast, there's the Bush Dynasty, the Lick Father, Lick Son.",Barney
06x19,"Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.",Jerry
06x19,Why?,Barney
06x19,"I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.",Jerry
06x19,"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",Barney
06x19,"I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.",Jerry
06x19,We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,Lily
06x19,What?,Barney
06x19,You're having dinner with him tonight.,Marshall
06x19,"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",Barney
06x19,Are you sure it's not more than that?,Robin
06x19,"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",Barney
06x19,"No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",Marshall
06x19,"Fine, I'll go.",Barney
06x19,"Awesome. Um, Lily, keys.  I'm literally 11 inches from you.",Marshall
06x19,And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.,Ted from 2030
06x19,Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.,Cherryl
06x19,"Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.",Barney
06x19,"Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.",Cherryl
06x19,"Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.",Barney
06x19,Guess now we wait.,Lily
06x19,"Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake?",Marshall
06x19,"Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",Robin
06x19,"Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",Marshall
06x19,"What, baby?",Lily
06x19,You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.,Marshall
06x19,That's not true.,Robin
06x19,"Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",Lily
06x19,I'm sorry.,Robin
06x19,I first noticed it at the bar.,Marshall
06x19,"Hey, Lily,  Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys.  ...  The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",Marshall
06x19,"It ages well, that's the thing.",Barney
06x19,You guys like my new soul patch?,Marshall
06x19,"Righteous hair tab, brotha.",Robin
06x19,"And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go.  ... Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",Marshall
06x19,I love him.,Lily
06x19,"Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",Marshall
06x19,"But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.",Lily
06x19,"Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",Marshall
06x19,"J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.",Jerry
06x19,I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,Barney
06x19,"Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.",Jerry
06x19,"Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.",JJ
06x19,"J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",Barney
06x19,"Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",Marshall
06x19,"Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",Ted
06x19,"Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, do the laundry",Marshall
06x19,You can't swallow pills.,Lily
06x19,"Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person.  Right? What?",Robin
06x19,"So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.",Cherryl
06x19,"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",Barney
06x19,I'm 11.,JJ
06x19,"Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",Barney
06x19,"Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J.",Cherryl
06x19,I got a paper route.,JJ
06x19,"Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",Barney
06x19,"Good slam, Barney.",Jerry
06x19,Jerry.,Cherryl
06x19,It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers.,Jerry
06x19,J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.,Cherryl
06x19,"Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?",Barney
06x19,Fourth period?,JJ
06x19,"Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",Barney
06x19,Got him again.,Jerry
06x19,Jerry!,Cherryl
06x19,"Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.",Jerry
06x19,Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?,Barney
06x19,J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.,Jerry
06x19,Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.,Barney
06x19,I like having a brother.,JJ
06x19,You always add too much water to oatmeal.,Ted
06x19,"Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.",Marshall
06x19,You consistently miss at least one belt loop.,Robin
06x19,It's like I'm blind.,Marshall
06x19,You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.,Lily
06x19,"Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.",Marshall
06x19,"Aw, honey.",Lily
06x19,"No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.",Marshall
06x19,"Barney, what is going on?",Jerry
06x19,This is mine.,Barney
06x19,I don't understand.,Jerry
06x19,"J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",Barney
06x19,"Please, just come down and talk to me.",Jerry
06x19,"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.",Barney
06x19,Why does that make you so mad?,Jerry
06x19,"Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",Barney
06x19,"Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...",Jerry
06x19,"Oh, screwed up doesn't even begin to describe...",Barney
06x19,"I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.",Jerry
06x19,Can you help me with this?,Barney
06x19,"Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.",Jerry
06x19,Bye.,Barney
06x19,Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?,Lily
06x19,"I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",Barney
06x19,"Yeah, buddy.",Ted
06x19,"You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?",Barney
06x19,"Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.",Ted
06x19,"No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.",Barney
06x20,"Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.",Ted from 2030
06x20,G-N-B is the e-ne-my!,Crowd
06x20,"Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on! Hey, sweetie! Are we still on for dinner at 8:00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait!",Zoey
06x20,That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait!,Crowd
06x20,"But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.",Ted from 2030
06x20,"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.",Barney
06x20,Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face?  She wants it.,Robin
06x20,Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?,Lily
06x20,"Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",Ted
06x20,You guys are in screaming matches all the time.,Lily
06x20,"Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.",Ted
06x20,It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.,Ted from 2030
06x20,The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!,Ted
06x20,Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!,Zoey
06x20,"Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.",Ted
06x20,"No, you hang up.",Ted
06x20,"No, you hang up.",Zoey
06x20,"No, you hang up.",Ted
06x20,"No, you hang up.",Zoey
06x20,"No, you hang up!  No, you hang up.",Ted
06x20,"No, you hang up.",Zoey
06x20,"No, you...  Hello?",Ted
06x20,"For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?",Robin
06x20,Why would you do that?!,Ted
06x20,I-I thought you'd like it.,Zoey
06x20,Who likes that?,Ted
06x20,I like it.,Zoey
06x20,Your relationship sounds exhausting.,Lily
06x20,"Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.",Ted
06x20,"Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",Lily
06x20,"Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.",Ted from 2030
06x20,I have to quit.,Marshall
06x20,Quit GNB?! Why?,Barney
06x20,"I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",Marshall
06x20,"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",Barney
06x20,"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
06x20,"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",Barney
06x20,I don't think you know what Spain is.,Robin
06x20,"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",Barney
06x20,It's dinero.,Ted
06x20,Where? I want his autograph!,Barney
06x20,"So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.",Ted from 2030
06x20,It's graduation goggles.,Robin
06x20,What?,Marshall
06x20,"Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",Robin
06x20,The guy who was basically a dog?,Lily
06x20,He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. : He was a good boy.,Robin
06x20,"Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having sx with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",Barney
06x20,"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",Robin
06x20,"You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",Marshall
06x20,"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",Barney
06x20,"Baby, more than ever, you have my full support.",Lily
06x20,"You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.",Ted
06x20,I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,Lily
06x20,It starts with an... L?,Barney
06x20,How can you not remember my name?,Girl
06x20,It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,Ted
06x20,"Well, they don't do that all the time.",Zoey
06x20,"Yes, they do.",Ted
06x20,"No, they don't.",Zoey
06x20,"Yes, they do. It's like they...",Ted
06x20,... don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.,Lily and Marshall
06x20,It rhymes with your name.,Girl
06x20,And I said my name was...?,Barney
06x20,"Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.",Marshall
06x20,"Oh, good for you, sweetie.",Lily
06x20,"Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
06x20,"Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",Lily
06x20,"Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play Who's Hot and Who's Scott?",Ted
06x20,"It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.",Barney
06x20,"Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.",Ted
06x20,"Guys, everything's ruined.",Man
06x20,What? Why?,Ted
06x20,"Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.",Man
06x20,"...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.",Robin
06x20,I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,Ted
06x20,Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?,Lily
06x20,Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is klling you?,Ted
06x20,It's not.,Lily
06x20,"Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?",Ted
06x20,"Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?",Lily
06x20,We take turns! Sometimes.,Ted
06x20,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",Marshall
06x20,I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,Barney
06x20,Hershel?,Robin
06x20,"What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",Barney
06x20,"Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.",Lily
06x20,There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,Barney
06x20,"Barney, I'm not playing...",Marshall
06x20,Just come back to GNB already!,Barney
06x20,I'm really loving my new job.,Marshall
06x20,"Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.",Lily
06x20,"I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
06x20,"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
06x20,"Thanks, baby.  Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.",Marshall
06x20,That's how I'm gonna use mine.,Barney
06x20,Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,Robin
06x20,"Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",Barney
06x20,"Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",Robin
06x20,"Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. Barney, we have to talk about your father. Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil. Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute. I don't need this!",Barney
06x20,"Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...",Ted
06x20,"Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go.",Lily
06x20,"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",Barney
06x20,"Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",Marshall
06x20,"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",Barney
06x20,"Oh, my God!",Robin
06x20,How long have you been there?,Barney
06x20,You don't remember?,Robin
06x20,"Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",Robin
06x20,"Oh, no, I'm fine.",Barney
06x20,"Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",Robin
06x20,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",Barney
06x20,Yeah.,Robin
06x20,"Right. So, um... Chinese?",Barney
06x20,"You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",Ted
06x20,"You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",Lily
06x20,"Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",Ted
06x20,But I thought you liked being challenged.,Lily
06x20,"Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",Ted
06x20,"Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",Lily
06x20,"You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go.",Ted
06x20,I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.,Man
06x20,"Um, he speaks perfect English.",Ted
06x20,"Yeah, I-I know.",Lily
06x20,Then why did you ask me to come?,Ted
06x20,"So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",Lily
06x20,"W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",Ted
06x20,"You were right. If I hear myself say Baby, you have my full support one more time, I swear I'm gonna mrder someone!",Lily
06x20,"What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",Ted
06x20,"I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bmb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",Lily
06x20,"Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",Ted
06x20,Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,Lily
06x20,But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,Ted
06x20,"I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",Lily
06x20,Lil...,Ted
06x20,"Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this.",Lily
06x20,"My bag? Oh, no. I got it.",Man
06x20,There's nothing to talk about.,Barney
06x20,"You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",Robin
06x20,"I don't want to talk about it, okay?",Barney
06x20,Why not?,Robin
06x20,Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,Barney
06x20,"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... : ticking.",Robin
06x20,That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,Barney
06x20,"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",Robin
06x20,Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,Barney
06x20,Huh?,Robin
06x20,It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,Barney
06x20,"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",Barney
06x20,"Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",Marshall
06x20,"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",Barney
06x20,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",Barney
06x20,What is wrong with you?,Robin
06x20,"Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",Marshall
06x20,"Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?",Prof. Rodriguez
06x20,"Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",Marshall
06x20,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",Ted
06x20,What?,Marshall
06x20,"Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily... Lily...",Ted
06x20,"Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",Lily
06x20,"Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",Marshall
06x20,"Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",Lily
06x20,"No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",Marshall
06x20,"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
06x20,Ted.,Zoey
06x20,Hey! What are you doing here?,Ted
06x20,"This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.",Zoey
06x20,This you can be supportive of?!,Ted
06x20,What is that supposed to mean?,Zoey
06x20,"I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kll that dream? My girlfriend!",Ted
06x20,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?",Zoey
06x20,"And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.",Ted from 2030
06x20,You're too young. This isn't fair.,Lily
06x20,"We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",Marshall
06x20,"Thank you, Marshall.  Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?",Barney
06x20,"Yes, of course, of course... anything.",Marshall
06x20,Eat this meatball sub.,Barney
06x20,Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,Marshall
06x20,I don't have much time!,Barney
06x20,"Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",Marshall
06x20,"I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up 30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!",Barney
06x20,"Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",Ted
06x21,"Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz kll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.",Jerry
06x21,What? That's... What is that word you taught me? Bull something?,Barney
06x21,"But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.",Jerry
06x21,But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,Barney
06x21,"Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?",Jerry
06x21,A drunk audience.,Barney
06x21,"Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying.","Jerry, laughing"
06x21,"Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly...",Ted from 2030
06x21,I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.,Jerry
06x21,This time it was Barney who did the walking.,Ted from 2030
06x21,Bye.,Barney
06x21,"And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...",Ted from 2030
06x21,"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",Barney
06x21,Mmm. Your dad?,Marshall
06x21,My dad!,Barney
06x21,Barney Stinson.,Barney
06x21,"Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?",Jerry
06x21,"Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",Barney
06x21,"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... Crazy Jerry? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?",Jerry
06x21,You do not know how right you are.,Barney
06x21,Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,Barney
06x21,"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",Ted
06x21,"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",Barney
06x21,"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",Robin
06x21,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",Barney
06x21,"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",Barney
06x21,That's why you brought these guys.,Lily
06x21,No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,Barney
06x21,Improvements?!,Marshall
06x21,Yeah.,Barney
06x21,"Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",Marshall
06x21,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",Barney
06x21,Whoo-hoo!,Lily
06x21,Gross!,Marshall
06x21,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",Barney
06x21,"Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, Man is least himself when he talks...",Ted
06x21,"Ted, card.",Barney
06x21,Ah. You're right... No quoting Oscar Wilde.,Ted
06x21,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",Barney
06x21,"Aw, man! Why?",Robin
06x21,"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.",Barney
06x21,"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",Lily
06x21,How good was that movie?,Ted
06x21,And... hence new identities.,Barney
06x21,And so Barney's dad finally showed up.,Ted from 2030
06x21,"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",Barney
06x21,"Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",Marshall
06x21,"Lily, his wife.",Barney
06x21,"Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",Lily
06x21,That's... a little depressing.,Jerry
06x21,"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",Ted
06x21,Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,Robin
06x21,"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",Barney
06x21,"Two, three, four!",ROBIN
06x21,"So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?",Jerry
06x21,"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",Barney
06x21,"Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",Marshall
06x21,"Oh, no.",Barney
06x21,"Oh, No shut down, too.",Marshall
06x21,There's Where?,Ted
06x21,Where's Where?,Jerry
06x21,"Where's where Was was, isn't it?",Lily
06x21,"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",Barney
06x21,Okay.,Jerry
06x21,Not Okay. That place is lame.,Ted
06x21,Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,Robin
06x21,That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,Marshall
06x21,"Guys, focus.",Barney
06x21,"Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",Robin
06x21,Where?,Ted
06x21,Not Where. Focus.,Robin
06x21,I thought Focus was closed.,Lily
06x21,"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",Barney
06x21,So Closed is open.,Marshall
06x21,"No, Closed is closed.",Robin
06x21,I don't know. Third base! Right?,Jerry
06x21,"Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",Robin
06x21,"I'll go anyplace, okay?",Jerry
06x21,Not Okay. Okay is lame.,Ted
06x21,Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.,Robin
06x21,"Guys, shut up.",Lily
06x21,"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.",Barney
06x21,"Guys, just pick a club, okay?",Marshall
06x21,Not Okay!,Ted
06x21,Okay is Lame! Gay bar.,All
06x21,"For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lam.",Marshall
06x21,"It's hopeless, isn't it?",Barney
06x21,Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,Marshall
06x21,I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,Barney
06x21,I might be allergic to this stamp.,Jerry
06x21,"Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.",Robin
06x21,Mila Kunis?!,Lily
06x21,"No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",Robin
06x21,Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?,Man
06x21,"Uh... no.  The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.",Robin
06x21,I was trying on the pants.,Man
06x21,Oh.,Robin
06x21,"I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",Robin
06x21,Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?,Man
06x21,"Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",Robin
06x21,I should be so lucky.,Man
06x21,Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.,Ted
06x21,Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.,Man
06x21,"Mm-hmm. You, too.",Robin
06x21,Yeah.,Man
06x21,You owe me one.,"Ted, whispering to Robin"
06x21,"Man, isn't this place great?",Barney
06x21,"Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!",Jerry
06x21,And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,Marshall
06x21,"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",Barney
06x21,"Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shts and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.",Lily
06x21,My goodness!,Jerry
06x21,"I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.",Marshall
06x21,"Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.",Lily
06x21,Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!,Marshall
06x21,I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your real job.,Lily
06x21,I won a Tony!,Marshall
06x21,I brought French cooking to America!,Lily
06x21,What?,Marshall
06x21,Let's do shots.,Barney
06x21,"Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.",Jerry
06x21,No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? Never stop partying.,Barney
06x21,I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.,"Jerry, looking horrified"
06x21,"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?",Barney
06x21,But I want to hang out with you.,Jerry
06x21,"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.",Barney
06x21,Fine. You want Crazy Jerry?  There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in.,Jerry
06x21,Oh...,All
06x21,"Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!",Jerry
06x21,Can you believe it? This is awesome!,Barney
06x21,"Barney, how is that awesome?",Robin
06x21,I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,Barney
06x21,So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?,Marshall
06x21,"Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.",Lily
06x21,"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have sx in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have sx in the bathroom.",Marhsall
06x21,So our usual wager. Deal.,Lily
06x21,"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",Barney
06x21,"Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?",Jerry
06x21,"No, of course not. I... I just...",Barney
06x21,"Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!",Jerry
06x21,"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!",Barney
06x21,"Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.",Robin
06x21,Okay. I would have stolen you a whole orchestra. There. What's the rush?,Ted
06x21,"Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?",Robin
06x21,"Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.",Ted
06x21,"A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?",Robin
06x21,Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.,Ted
06x21,You're a doofus and a half.,Robin
06x21,Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?,Ted
06x21,At a close-out sale at Dawes.,Robin
06x21,Really? I remember that sale.,Ted
06x21,"Hey, Robin.",Ted
06x21,"Oh, Ted. Oh, no.",Robin
06x21,Look what I just bought. Right? Right?,Ted
06x21,"Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great sx that night. Great sx.",Ted
06x21,Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots.,Ted
06x21,Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.,Robin
06x21,All right.,Ted
06x21,"All right. Whoa, stop.",Robin
06x21,What?,Ted
06x21,Stop. Perfect.,Robin
06x21,"But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.",Ted
06x21,"Yeah. Yeah, just like that.",Robin
06x21,You were picturing your crush!,Ted
06x21,"Well, somebody had to.",Robin
06x21,"Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?",Ted
06x21,Yes.,Robin
06x21,"You hear that, everybody? She said yes! We're getting married!  I love this girl. I'm never letting her go.","Ted, loudly"
06x21,"Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!",Jerry
06x21,"After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy.",Ted from 2030
06x21,"You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!","Jerry, to a big tattoed biker"
06x21,": Hey, hey! There we go!",Barney
06x21,"Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!",Jerry
06x21,Oh...!,Barney
06x21,I just puked on the hood of that... police car!,Jerry
06x21,"Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.",Jerry
06x21,"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...",Barney
06x21,"Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!",Jerry
06x21,What?,Barney
06x21,"I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise.",Jerry
06x21,Here you go.,Jerry
06x21,Whoa!,Barney
06x21,"Bottoms up, amigo!",Jerry
06x21,But all those crazy things you did.,Barney
06x21,Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?,Jerry
06x21,A drunk audience.,Barney
06x21,"You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!","Jerry, to a dummy wearing a biker outfit"
06x21,"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!",Barney
06x21,Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!,Jerry
06x21,Oh...!,Barney
06x21,What just happened?,Barney
06x21,I... I just puked on the hood of that... ...police car.,Jerry
06x21,"Well, why do all those things?",Barney
06x21,"I figured if I showed you what... never stop partying really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well.",Jerry
06x21,You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,Barney
06x21,I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.,Jerry
06x21,"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.",Barney
06x21,Perhaps.,Jerry
06x21,"Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too.  Abracadabra!",Barney
06x21,Congratulations!,Woman
06x21,"Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June.  Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?",Robin
06x21,"Wow. Wardrobe malfunction at the O.K. Corral! I mean, who in their right mind would ever...","Ted, chuckling"
06x21,You would look so totally hot in those.,Woman
06x21,Do you have these in a size 11?,Ted
06x21,"So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.",Robin
06x21,Hello.,Marshall
06x21,"I, uh... Oh.",Robin
06x21,"Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?",Marshall
06x21,We need someplace to hide.,Barney
06x21,Where?,Jerry
06x21,"No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.",Barney
06x21,"Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.",Jerry
06x21,Step on it! Jerry...,Barney
06x21,Do not step on it.,Jerry
06x21,"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.",Barney
06x21,The laws are there to protect...,Jerry
06x21,This is no time for laws!,Barney
06x21,"Buckle up, Barney.",Jerry
06x21,I am not going to buckle up!,Barney
06x21,I am your father! You will listen to me!,Jerry
06x21,Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?,Ted
06x21,I won that race. My prize... sx in the bathroom.,Lily
06x21,And I won that race.,Marshall
06x21,"Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.",Lily
06x21,"Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",Robin
06x21,Why are you smiling?,Lily
06x21,I don't know. Good night.,Robin
06x21,Saw that girl again. And guess what? She's engaged. So that's the end of that.,"Man, on the phone"
06x21,It wasn't the end of that. More on that later,Ted from 2030
06x21,And her fianc? The guy's like a two.,Man
06x21,How did you do it?,Barney
06x21,Do what?,Jerry
06x21,"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",Barney
06x21,You're drifting.,Jerry
06x21,"Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...",Barney
06x21,"No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.",Jerry
06x21,"When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.",Barney
06x21,"Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.",Jerry
06x21,So how do you do it?,Barney
06x21,A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.,Jerry
06x21,Maybe I've met her already.,Barney
06x21,"And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.",Jerry
06x21,Maybe some other time.,Barney
06x21,"Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.",Jerry
06x21,I'm going fishing with my dad.,Barney
06x21,This... sucks.,Barney
06x22,"Kids, when your Uncle Marshall finally quit Goliath National Bank to do something better with his life, he left on great terms with his boss.",Ted from 2030
06x22,"Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference.",Arthur
06x22,Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing.,Ted from 2030
06x22,I'm sorry. I don't think you're the kind of person we're looking for. I just got off the phone with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB.,Head of the environmental Organization
06x22,"Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up.",Arthur
06x22,"Marshall! Hey, it's, uh, it's 2:30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch.",Arthur
06x22,Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.,Marshall
06x22,Oh! Mr. Eriksen... You're not wearing any pants.,Assistant
06x22,Your move.,Marshall
06x22,"But Marshall, wh... What about the environment?",Assistant
06x22,Screw the environment!,Marshall
06x22,Screw the environment?!,Head of the environmental Organization
06x22,"Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist.",Arthur
06x22,"Sir, none of that is...",Marshall
06x22,Sorry. Interview over.,Head of the environmental Organization
06x22,"And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey.",Ted from 2030
06x22,"If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.",Zoey
06x22,"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to Hot For Teacher. Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.",Barney
06x22,"Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.",Robin
06x22,"Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...",Barney
06x22,"Dude, that's my girlfriend.",Ted
06x22,"Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?",Barney
06x22,You know it.,Ted
06x22,"Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",Lily
06x22,"Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.",Barney
06x22,Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?,Lily
06x22,"At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.",Ted
06x22,"So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?",Lily
06x22,"Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.",Ted
06x22,"Hey, guys.",Zoey
06x22,Hey!,All
06x22,Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,Zoey
06x22,So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?,Ted
06x22,"Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.",Robin
06x22,Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down.,Zoey
06x22,"Yeah, totally.",Marshall
06x22,"So, they found water on Mars. What?",Ted
06x22,"Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?",Marshall
06x22,"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?",Barney
06x22,That was on purpose!,Lily
06x22,I mean this is really like...,Barney
06x22,"Barney, please...",Marshall
06x22,And thus began an all-out wr between Barney and Marshall...,Ted from 2030
06x22,Delivery from Mr. Stinson.,Delivery Guy
06x22,"Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?!",Zoey
06x22,Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!,Marshall
06x22,"Later, back at the bar... another wr was just beginning.",Ted from 2030
06x22,"Babe, can I get you a drink?",Lily
06x22,"No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.",Marshall
06x22,I know.,Lily
06x22,You know what? Screw this. Game on.,Marshall
06x22,Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.,Lily
06x22,That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.,Robin
06x22,The walk-by with the stink eye.,Lily
06x22,"A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed.","Robin, in a high-pitched voice"
06x22,Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!,Marshall
06x22,No. I' was... I was...,Barney
06x22,This went on for days.,Ted from 2030
06x22,Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.,Barney
06x22,"Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't.",Barney
06x22,"Oh, bye-bye.",Marshall
06x22,"Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes.",Marshall
06x22,"Oh, boy. Look who's back.",Lily
06x22,"Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style All Night Long?",Robin
06x22,"Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.",Lily
06x22,"Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.",Marshall
06x22,Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,Barney
06x22,That's it!,Marshall
06x22,Kent! Kent!,Barney
06x22,"Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!",Marshall
06x22,"That's what you get, you traitor!",Barney
06x22,"Oh, really? Really?",Marshall
06x22,Yeah. Really.,Barney
06x22,Really. That... what...,Marshall
06x22,"Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.",Carl
06x22,Ejected!,Robin
06x22,I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!,Carl
06x22,"Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous.  Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.",Robin
06x22,"This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.",Lily
06x22,"Man, what are we going to do without her?",Robin
06x22,Oh...,Lily
06x22,"Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.",Robin
06x22,"Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",Lily
06x22,"Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",Robin
06x22,"Ten, nine, eight...",All
06x22,"I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",Barney
06x22,Happy New Year!,All
06x22,"If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.",Robin
06x22,Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.,Lily
06x22,"Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.",Marshall
06x22,How about martinis?,Lily
06x22,Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.,Robin
06x22,Why not?,Lily
06x22,"Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",Lily
06x22,Every time.,Robin
06x22,I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...,Lily
06x22,Uh-huh.,Robin
06x22,"Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?",Lily
06x22,"I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...",Marshall
06x22,We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.,Robin
06x22,"I keep telling you, that didn't happen.",Lily
06x22,"It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",Robin
06x22,Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,Lily
06x22,Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out.,"Marshall, talking to a mirror"
06x22,"Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",Ted
06x22,Peppermint schnapps?,Lily
06x22,No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.,Robin
06x22,Who?,Lily
06x22,"The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.",Robin
06x22,"Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...",Barney
06x22,"Hey, where are our chicken wings?",Ted
06x22,Show me chicken wings!,Barney
06x22,"Good order, Ted! Good order!",All
06x22,"Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.",Ted
06x22,"Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",Lily
06x22,Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.,Ted
06x22,"Peace, I'm out.",Ted
06x22,"Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",Lily
06x22,Peace. I'm out.,Ted
06x22,"You had to take that away from me, didn't you?",Ted
06x22,"Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.",Robin
06x22,What do you mean?,Ted
06x22,Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,Lily
06x22,Stop.,Robin
06x22,"Man, how did things get so screwed up?",Ted
06x22,Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits.,Ted from 2030
06x22,You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,Ted
06x22,I thought we weren't talking about...,Zoey
06x22,"We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",Ted
06x22,Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?,Zoey
06x22,"Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",Ted
06x22,"You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.",Zoey
06x22,Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,Ted
06x22,Okay.,Zoey
06x22,We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,Lily
06x22,"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",Robin
06x22,I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,Lily
06x22,Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,Barney
06x22,Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,Marshall
06x22,"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",Barney
06x22,I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,Marshall
06x22,"Oh, my God.",Barney
06x22,"Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",Ted
06x22,You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.,Zoey
06x22,That's not a chocolate.,Ted
06x22,"Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",Robin
06x22,"Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",Lily
06x22,"See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",Marshall
06x22,"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",Barney
06x22,"Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",Marshall
06x22,"It made me wonder, What could I have done to make him stay?",Barney
06x22,"Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",Marshall
06x22,That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,Barney
06x22,Wow. That got real o'clock.,Robin
06x22,Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,Lily
06x22,"Dance, my puppets, dance!",Robin
06x22,Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,Lily
06x22,"Oh, God, totally!",Robin
06x22,"Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?",Zoey
06x22,"Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",Ted
06x22,What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,Ted
06x22,This bathroom for entire floor!,Woman
06x22,Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,Lily
06x22,"Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",Robin
06x22,"Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",Lily
06x22,What? What is it?,Robin
06x22,What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,Lily
06x22,Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.,Barney
06x22,"Kids, don't drink tequila.",Ted from 2030
06x22,"Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having sx next door... with a third very small man.",Ted
06x22,I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.,Zoey
06x22,"Okay. What is it? And don't give me, It's beautiful. Don't give me, It's magnificent What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",Ted
06x22,Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here.,Zoey
06x22,"Why, why have you never told me that?",Ted
06x22,"I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.",Zoey
06x22,"Kids, you never forget the first time or place you tell a girl:",Ted from 2030
06x22,I love you.,Ted
06x22,"I love you, too.",Zoey
06x22,"Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up.",Carl
06x22,"Well, what drink finally did the trick?",Robin
06x22,"Of course, beer.",Robin  Lily
06x22,I love you.,Marshall
06x22,I love you.,Barney
06x22,"Uh, no. N-Not right...",Barney
06x22,"You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.",Ted
06x22,"See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that?",Zoey
06x22,What was what?,Ted
06x22,I think it went under the bed.,Zoey
06x22,I don't see anything.,Ted
06x22,"That, that was... that!",Zoey
06x22,"Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!",Ted
06x22,The what?,Zoey
06x22,"Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.",Ted
06x22,Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!,Zoey
06x22,"Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.",Lily
06x22,Morning. Who wants breakfast?,Robin
06x22,You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?,Barney
06x22,"Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!",Marshall
06x22,I thought they made up last night.,Lily
06x22,"Damn it, I know what happened.",Robin
06x22,I love you.,Marshall
06x22,"I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...",Barney
06x22,"Carl, a round of champagne.",Lily
06x22,Ooh! The champagne.,Lily
06x22,We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,Robin
06x22,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",Barney
06x22,"Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
06x22,"Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",Barney
06x22,"Okay, what drink can fix this?",Robin
06x22,Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?,Lily
06x22,I got it.,Robin
06x22,Right?,Robin
06x22,Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...,Lily
06x22,What is that?,Woman
06x23,"Kids, this is a story of landmarks. There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all.",Ted from 2030
06x23,"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember: if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call...",Marshall
06x23,"All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.",Chairman
06x23,I just have...,Marshall
06x23,"We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's klling me. What rhymes with beck and call?",Chairman
06x23,Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,Marshall
06x23,Ah...,Audience
06x23,Thank you.,Marshall
06x23,"Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question.",Chairman
06x23,"Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said...",Ted from 2030
06x23,"Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark. And then the crowd gasps: Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!",Ted
06x23,So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?,Zoey
06x23,"Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say yes?",Ted
06x23,"That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.",Zoey
06x23,"I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",Marshall
06x23,Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...,Zoey
06x23,Nice.,Marshall
06x23,I have a message from Barney.,Robin
06x23,Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened.,Ted from 2030
06x23,Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,Zoey
06x23,And then this happened.,Ted from 2030
06x23,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!",Zoey
06x23,"Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
06x23,Which led to this happening.,Ted from 2030
06x23,"Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.",Zoey
06x23,"Mmm. Love you, too.",Ted
06x23,"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",Lily
06x23,"Yeah, I have that, too.",Robin
06x23,Damn it.,Lily
06x23,"All right, here's the message.  So, what are you turds up to?",Robin
06x23,"Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",Marshall
06x23,Why does it need to rhyme?,Ted
06x23,"If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",Marshall
06x23,"Yeah. It's why in our apartment: If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor.",Lily
06x23,And she hasn't since.,Marshall
06x23,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",Barney
06x23,Nailed it.,Marshall
06x23,"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",Barney
06x23,"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",Ted
06x23,I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,Barney
06x23,What?,Ted
06x23,"Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",Barney
06x23,"I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",Lily
06x23,I once knew such a girl.,Barney
06x23,It was last call. In this very bar.,Barney
06x23,What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,Barney
06x23,"Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",Robin
06x23,"Barney, this is about the building.",Ted
06x23,Come on. This is so about the girl.,Barney
06x23,"Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",Ted
06x23,Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,Lily
06x23,"Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",Ted
06x23,"Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be.  That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",Barney
06x23,"Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.",Ted from 2030
06x23,"Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",Barney
06x23,"No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.",Arthur
06x23,Isn't that animal cruelty?,Barney
06x23,I'm talking about my wife.,Arthur
06x23,"Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",Barney
06x23,"Yeah, I know your friend Ted.",Arthur
06x23,"So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you?  Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...",Barney
06x23,"No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.",Arthur
06x23,Come again for Big Fudge?,Barney
06x23,"Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",Barney
06x23,I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,Robin
06x23,I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,Barney
06x23,Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?,Arthur
06x23,By being the best architect available?,Barney
06x23,No.,Arthur
06x23,By... being Latino?,Barney
06x23,No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.,Arthur
06x23,"Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",Barney
06x23,Damn it! I was kidding?,Barney
06x23,"I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",Barney
06x23,"Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.",Arthur
06x23,Damn it!,Both
06x23,"No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.",Arthur
06x23,They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,Ted
06x23,And he's been doing it for years.,Marshall
06x23,"Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",Lily
06x23,No idea.,Ted
06x23,He has a lot of keys.,Marshall
06x23,"Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",Robin
06x23,There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,Ted
06x23,"Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",Robin
06x23,The chairman asks you...,Robin
06x23,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,Chairman
06x23,You say...,Robin
06x23,No.,Ted
06x23,And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,Robin
06x23,We're done here.,Zoey
06x23,There's the second scenario.,Robin
06x23,The chairman asks you...,Robin
06x23,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,Chairman
06x23,You say...,Robin
06x23,Yes,Ted
06x23,"And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",Robin
06x23,We're done here.,Ted
06x23,You said there was a third scenario.,Ted
06x23,Right.,Robin
06x23,The chairman asks you...,Robin
06x23,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,Chairman
06x23,But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,Robin
06x23,That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,Robin
06x23,"Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle...",Ted
06x23,Tree?,Lily
06x23,"Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",Ted
06x23,"I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",Lily
06x23,Thank you.,Ted
06x23,"I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",Lily
06x23,Thank you.,Robin
06x23,"That night, as I slept soundly...",Ted from 2030
06x23,"Barney, what are you doing?",Ted
06x23,"Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream...",Ghost
06x23,Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,Ted
06x23,"Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words: do not try to save The Arcadian.",Ghost
06x23,"Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",Ted
06x23,I am not... Barney...,"Ghost, shouting dramatically"
06x23,Whoa! Lighting change!,Ted
06x23,"Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy.",Ghost
06x23,"Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",Ted
06x23,"New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn.",Ghost
06x23,"The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",Ted
06x23,Indeed.,Ghost
06x23,You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,Ted
06x23,"Mo' buildings, mo' problems.",Ghost
06x23,"This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",Ted
06x23,"Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.",Ghost
06x23,"Dream! Dream! It was just a dream.  Hey. I know it's late, but, uh... you want to meet up?","Ted, panting"
06x23,"Hello, Mr. Lion.",Zoey
06x23,"Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair",Ted
06x23,"Hey, I met you right......here.",Zoey
06x23,Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,Ted
06x23,"As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.",Zoey
06x23,Worth every penny.,Ted
06x23,All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...,Zoey
06x23,"No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",Ted
06x23,Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.,Zoey
06x23,Exactly.,Ted
06x23,You okay?,Zoey
06x23,Yeah. Good night.,Ted
06x23,"Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark?",Chairman
06x23,"No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",Ted
06x23,"E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this?",Zoey
06x23,The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of... wieners and gonads.,"Ted, on recorder"
06x23,"Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?",Chairman
06x23,"Yeah, that's me.",Ted
06x23,"This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",Ted
06x23,They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,Robin
06x23,Yeah.,Ted
06x23,"We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",Barney
06x23,"Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",Marshall
06x23,What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,Ted
06x23,We should totally buy a bar!,Barney
06x23,We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,Marshall
06x23,It's really the only sensible idea right now.,Robin
06x23,"Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",Marshall
06x23,Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,Ted
06x23,I'll allow it!,Marshall
06x23,"The only court where you show up, then get served.",Barney
06x23,Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,Robin
06x23,That's not bad.,Ted
06x23,Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,Lily
06x23,"Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",Ted
06x23,"I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen.  And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?",Marshall
06x23,"Oh, this ought to be good.",Barney
06x23,And then Lily told us her plan.,Ted from 2030
06x23,"Oh, this is good!",Barney
06x23,We have to find Arthur right now.,Ted
06x23,"What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!",Arthur
06x23,"Hey, Arthur!",Barney
06x23,"Oh, cute dog!",Robin
06x23,"No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!",Arthur
06x23,"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",Barney
06x23,"Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!",Arthur
06x23,"Uh... Hey, Arthur?",Barney
06x23,I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?,Arthur
06x23,"Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",Lily
06x23,Dibs.,Barney
06x23,Fine! What's the idea?,Arthur
06x23,Well...,Lily
06x23,"Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict.",Ted from 2030
06x23,"Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied.",Chairman
06x23,Zoey... Zoey!,Ted
06x23,"All right, what do you have to say for yourself?",Zoey
06x23,I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.,Ted
06x23,We're done here.,Zoey
06x23,"Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.",Ted
06x23,"I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet.  I hope I used the right screws.",Barney
06x24,"Kids, in the spring of 2011, Zoey and I broke up. But the good news: Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them.  The only problem was... I kept butting heads with my project supervisor on one very important issue.",Ted from 2030
06x24,I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!,Ted
06x24,I want to press it!,Barney
06x24,I want to press it!,Ted
06x24,I want to press it!,Barney
06x24,"Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, Baby, that was great and go to sleep.",Robin
06x24,She means you. I want to press it! I'm gonna press it!,Barney
06x24,"It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?",Robin
06x24,"Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",Ted
06x24,That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,Robin
06x24,"I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.",Zoey
06x24,Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,Ted
06x24,"They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win.",Zoey
06x24,"Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",Ted
06x24,Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?,Zoey
06x24,You know that coffee is code for I want to get back together right?,Robin
06x24,"Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",Ted
06x24,I want to get back together.,Zoey
06x24,"Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.",Ted
06x24,"You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?",Barney
06x24,I'm not letting you press the button.,Ted
06x24,I want to press the button!,Barney
06x24,You're not pressing the button! It's my button!,Ted
06x24,"Sadly, that's all you need to know about my summer. Now, around this time, Uncle Marshall was still having a tough time finding a job.",Ted from 2030
06x24,"He's out printing out a whole new batch of rsums because he misspelled the phrase detail-oriented. And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.",Lily
06x24,"Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",Robin
06x24,"Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, Get sick, get a free gallon of soup.",Lily
06x24,"And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet.",Ted from 2030
06x24,"This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with...  Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.",Lily
06x24,This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?,Marshall
06x24,"Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?",Robin
06x24,Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!,Barney
06x24,You okay?,Robin
06x24,Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,Ted
06x24,"Hey, hotshot.",Foreman
06x24,"You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.",Ted
06x24,"Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot.",Rod
06x24,"50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",Ted
06x24,"Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?",Barney
06x24,There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,Ted
06x24,Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better.,Barney
06x24,You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.,Ted
06x24,"Ah, but new is always better is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.",Barney
06x24,"Hi, Marsh.",Ted
06x24,"Oh, hey, buddy.",Barney
06x24,Hey. Everything okay?,Robin
06x24,"Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.",Marshall
06x24,"Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?",Lily
06x24,"Of course, baby.",Marshall
06x24,"But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...",Marshall
06x24,"Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.",Marshall
06x24,"Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?",Lily
06x24,"Um, I...",Marshall
06x24,"Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say under the weather, or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
06x24,I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,Marshall
06x24,I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,Barney
06x24,I bet it's her tushie.,Robin
06x24,"I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",Barney
06x24,"Yeah, fine, okay.","Ted, while texting on his phone"
06x24,"I got you this job, so I... Say what?",Barney
06x24,Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run.,Ted
06x24,You...,Barney
06x24,"Hello?... Yes, it is.  Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby.","Marshall, picking up his phone"
06x24,Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. See you in an hour.,Robin
06x24,Who's that from?,Barney
06x24,Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,Robin
06x24,Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,Barney
06x24,"After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",Robin
06x24,"No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.",Barney
06x24,"Uh, Ted's gone back for less.",Robin
06x24,"Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
06x24,Bro.,Ted
06x24,"Ted, I only have one rule.",Barney
06x24,"But I can't reach the worst part.  Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
06x24,"Coming up next, our two local pandas, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, are expecting a baby.",announcer
06x24,"Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?",Ted
06x24,"Get it together, bro.",Robin
06x24,"According to my calculations, at 6:00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time.",Marshall
06x24,"Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?",Lily
06x24,Don't worry. I'll be prepared.,Marshall
06x24,"I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie?",Neighbor
06x24,Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,Marshall
06x24,We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,Barney
06x24,"Okay, Zoey wrote, Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.",Robin
06x24,"Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.",Barney
06x24,Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection...,Ted
06x24,"Aw, that's sweet.",Robin
06x24,You weren't listening either?,Barney
06x24,"I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",Robin
06x24,Lily!,Barney
06x24,"Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.",Lily
06x24,Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.,Robin
06x24,"Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.",Lily
06x24,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us you're exploding from both ends like a busted fire hydrant.",Ted's voice
06x24,"Damn it, Marshall.",Lily
06x24,"Anyway, listen, I was going to get back together with Zoey today, but I came to my senses on the way out here, so... False alarm... Oh, crap. Just stepped in some gum. I'm getting back together with Zoey!",Ted's voice
06x24,"Okay, we're never gonna find him.",Robin
06x24,"Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.",Lily
06x24,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us...",voice
06x24,Got it. Ted's at...  Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.,Lily
06x24,That's the intersection.,Barney
06x24,That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,Robin
06x24,Way ahead of ya.,Barney
06x24,Hello!,Ranjit
06x24,Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.,Man
06x24,"Hello, hi.",Marshall
06x24,"Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train.",Jake
06x24,I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,Robin
06x24,I know. They're a total train wreck.,Barney
06x24,Unmitigated disaster.,Robin
06x24,Worst couple ever.,Ranjit
06x24,"Yeah, almost as bad as us.",Barney
06x24,"We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.",Robin
06x24,"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.",Barney
06x24,You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,Robin
06x24,"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",Barney
06x24,I guess I get it.,Robin
06x24,What do you mean?,Barney
06x24,"Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",Robin
06x24,"Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?",Barney
06x24,"Yeah, she did.",Robin
06x24,Smith and Ninth Street.,Ranjit
06x24,"So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that?",Jake
06x24,That's a seal.,Marshall
06x24,"Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste.",Jake
06x24,Mm-hmm.,Marshall
06x24,"Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open.",Jake
06x24,"Okay, where the hell are they?",Robin
06x24,Maybe this isn't the intersection.,Barney
06x24,"Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.",Robin
06x24,"I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever.",Man
06x24,Wait. Where'd you get that?,Robin
06x24,"Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?",Man
06x24,She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,Barney
06x24,"Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",Robin
06x24,"Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.",Barney
06x24,"Thanks, Julia! You know what? Let me see the pink lady slipper again.","Ted, leaving the florist's shop"
06x24,"Now, do you know what that is?",Jake
06x24,A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.,Marshall
06x24,"Being eaten by rats. Exactly. Now this next slide... Oh, I'm sorry. That's my wife's water birth. I don't know how that got in there. Anyway, that's all my questions.",Jake
06x24,"Oh, my God, I made it! Now just shake his hand, clench your very soul and run like hell!","Marshall, thinking"
06x24,"Now, I like to set aside 20 minutes at the end of every interview for your questions. So don't hold back. Whatever you got inside there, you just let 'er rip.",Jake
06x24,I can't do this anymore. I'm just gonna tell him the truth.,"Marshall, thinking"
06x24,"When it's stomach stuff, you just say under the weather or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
06x24,I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends!,Marshall
06x24,Nailed it.,Lily
06x24,"Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!",Ted
06x24,You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.,Robin
06x24,"I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!",Ted
06x24,"Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.",Robin
06x24,But... it's a mistake.,Barney
06x24,You're right.  No. Hi.,Ted
06x24,And kids... that's how I met your mother. Psych. It was just some chick.,Ted from 2030
06x24,"Hey, baby, how'd it go?",Lily
06x24,"Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now: just losing what's inside until I'm just empty.",Marshall
06x24,"Baby, come here.",Lily
06x24,I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts.,Marshall
06x24,And Marshall slept...all night.,Ted from 2030
06x24,"Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors?",Rod
06x24,He is.,Barney
06x24,You sure?,Ted
06x24,Yeah. You earned it.,Barney
06x24,All clear!,Rod
06x24,"Hey, new is always better, right?",Ted
06x24,Always.,Barney
06x24,"Ten, nine, eight...",Rod
06x24,"Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick.",Marshall
06x24,"I know, baby. I'm pregnant.",Lily
06x24,...one!,Rod
06x24,I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.,Robin
06x24,"It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please?  Norah.",Barney
06x24,Hi.,Norah
06x24,How you been?,Barney
06x24,Fine.,Norah
06x24,"Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.",Barney
06x24,I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.,Norah
06x24,"I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.",Barney
06x24,"It's never too late, Barney.",Norah
06x24,Challenge accepted.,Barney
06x24,Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
06x24,"Geez, what now?  I heard the groom needed me.",Ted
06x24,What do you think of this tie?,Barney
07x01,"Children, if there is a major theme in this story, and I swear, it's almost, really, not quite at the end of the story.This is timing. The timing makes all the difference. For example, I never met your mother if it was not for a wedding.The last of the weddings that I thought would be.",Ted 
07x01,What do you think of this tie?,Barney
07x01,"Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?",Ted
07x01,This one is better?,Barney
07x01,"The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.",Ted
07x01,"I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?",Barney
07x01,"Yeah, sure.",Ted
07x01,I do not really talk about the tie.,Barney
07x01,"Yeah, I realized that Barney.",Ted
07x01,I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?,Barney
07x01,Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.,Ted
07x01,That of Punchy.,Barney
07x01,Marshall has really ruined all that.,Ted
07x01,The story of Uncle Marshall has ruined everything in my friend's wedding Punchy starts in September 2011.,Ted 
07x01,Punchy asked me to be his witness.,Ted 
07x01,Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?,Ted
07x01,"Yeah, no problem, of course.",Barney
07x01,Ok,Ted
07x01,Woow.,Barney
07x01,There are several different versions.,Ted
07x01,"Ted, why you work so hard on this speech? Punchy has applied with a karaoke microphone in a bowling alley.",Robin
07x01,"Ok, I have never said that, but over the years, some of my friends from high school asked me to give speeches at their weddings, and they have not gone well.",Ted
07x01,"These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle.  Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!",Ted
07x01,A Schmosby classic.,Punchy
07x01,Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?,Robin
07x01,"Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.",Ted
07x01,"Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland.",Barney
07x01,This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.,Ted 
07x01,"Here's your speech. In single file, girls. No big.",Barney
07x01,This is ridiculous.,Ted
07x01,"Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. In single file, girls.",Barney
07x01,I will not Punchy's wedding to brag... cover of a magazine.,Ted
07x01,"Barney, he did not need your advice. You never called Nora.",Robin
07x01,"Children, you remember Nora. But the other day...",Ted 
07x01,I'll call you.,Barney
07x01,"It's never too late, Barney.",Nora
07x01,Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?,Robin
07x01,I did not call.,Barney
07x01,"Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?",Robin
07x01,"Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.",Lily
07x01,"I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings.",Barney
07x01,Cannibal.,Lily
07x01,"Ok, next tour for me.",Robin
07x01,"Oh no, no, it does that.",Marshall
07x01,Lily and Marshall had just heard that they have a baby.,Ted 
07x01,I can not wait to tell everyone.,Marshall
07x01,"Baby, no one can tell anyone. Not before three months. I do not want you to have bad luck.",Lily
07x01,"It's a bit superstitious, do not you think?",Marshall
07x01,"Whenever you take a plane, you lick.",Lily
07x01,Has it been crashed once?,Marshall
07x01,Do not say a word until we know that all is well. Ok?,Lily
07x01,"Ok, so everything will be okay. Promised.",Marshall
07x01,How can you guarantee that?,Lily
07x01,Come here.,"Marshall, lifting the shirt of Lily"
07x01,I'm so happy. I do not know how we will keep this secret for three months.,Marshall
07x01,Relax. It will be easy.,Lily
07x01,What'll it be?,Bartender
07x01,"Four beer, plus a non-alcoholic.",Lily
07x01,You're pregnant! Come here!,Bartender
07x01,So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.,Ted 
07x01,"Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.",Barney
07x01,You're going to try to make you anybody here?,Robin
07x01,What?,Barney
07x01,"My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.",Robin
07x01,"It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83...",Barney
07x01,17. He always reverse.,Ted
07x01,"... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?",Barney
07x01,"No, no.",All
07x01,We'll never know unless I try tonight.,Barney
07x01,Schmosby! Oh! Shit head! What's up?!,Punchy
07x01,You really feel this ring now.,Marshall
07x01,Glad you all here.,Kelly
07x01,"Open Bar. Bottoms up, shit head, because it is the father of Kelly who pays, and he hates me.",Punchy
07x01,It's true.,Kelly
07x01,"Who drinks? Go, go.",Punchy
07x01,"Oh, no, thank you.",Lily
07x01,You're pregnant or what?,Punchy
07x01,"Let's be crazy! You're going to drink for two tonight, baby.",Lily
07x01,I'll do it for the child.,Marshall
07x01,Go Browns!,Kelly and Punchy
07x01,"During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.",Marshall
07x01,"Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero.",Barney
07x01,"Lily, you go getting drunk tonight.",Robin
07x01,"That's all you, baby.",Lily
07x01,I'd to 4 glasses without eating.,Marshall
07x01,In nine months I would push a baby Eriksen with a pumpkin head out of my hoo-haa. I think Dad can handle a few cocktails and more.,Lily
07x01,Well done.,Marshall
07x01,Hakuna Matata!,Lily
07x01,I gotta go get some air.,Marshall
07x01,"My God, have you seen this guy. I want Barney is my new boyfriend. No, thank you.",Robin
07x01,Wait a minute. It's your voice of truth.,Lily
07x01,My what?,Robin
07x01,"Whenever you try to pretend that you're kidding but in fact it is profoundly true, you are using that voice.",Lily
07x01,I would like the Spice Girls back together. They were awesome. The worst.  birthday gift from my father. All I want from him is that he tells me he loves me. Just kidding.This pen is sufficient. It's enough. It is completely sufficient.,Robin
07x01,"Oh, my God. You always have feelings for Barney. Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney.",Lily
07x01,"You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.",Robin
07x01,"Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you?  Sea...",Barney
07x01,"Eager to hear your toast, Schmosby.",Man
07x01,"Yeah, here is the whiner.",Punchy
07x01,Wait. You encourage me to cry at your own wedding?,Ted
07x01,"Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.",Punchy
07x01,"Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that.",Barney
07x01,"I've told you, I'm not here to brag, ok?",Ted
07x01,"That's it. You're too polite to brag. Well, fine. Let me do it. Because the only person on Earth who loves more than Ted Mosby Marshall Eriksen Marshall Eriksen is drunk. So here we go.",Marshall
07x01,"Children, do you remember when I see have said that Marshall would ruin the marriage of Punchy and Kelly? It was not that either.",Ted 
07x01,Barney and I have tried and failed. It was there two years. Why would I start? It would not make sense.,Robin
07x01,"It does not make sense. It's chemistry. Listen, I always them a sixth sense for these things. And now that I'm pregnant... deep in me in my uterus, I see things more clearly. You and Barney have that kind of chemistry that is still there.",Lily
07x01,Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?,Robin
07x01,"It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?",Barney
07x01,You're the reason why he never called Nora. You're the reason why he only tests tonight. And you're the reason why he continues to try to impress. Chemistry.,Lily
07x01,"Wow! Ted! It's really you on the cover of New York.Now, you say yes.",Marshall
07x01,Stop please.,Ted
07x01,Schmosby. What is this magazine?,Man
07x01,"You know what, Clay? It's nothing.",Ted
07x01,"You know what? This is not nothing. Clay, my friend Ted has designed a building, Clay. What do you do, Clay?",Marshall
07x01,"Well, I'm still working in the rental car...",Clay
07x01,"Hear, hear, Clay. No major publication does write about your small agency?",Marshall
07x01,"No, no, no items. My life is monotonous. I think the only news is that little thing.",Clay
07x01,"Oh my God, look at this little baby. She's so cute. All I want is to put her little feet in my mouth. You have created something really beautiful.",Marshall
07x01,It's all for me.,Clay
07x01,"I mean, it's still huge... The building, you know?",Ted
07x01,"Hey, kid.  So this little angel is already every night?",Marshall
07x01,I spent many sleepless nights... to design this building. Nothing symbolism there.,Ted
07x01,Forget it. There is no chemistry between Barney and me. It's over.,Robin
07x01,Oh really? Prove it. Go talk to him.,Lily
07x01,Why should I tell him about that?,Robin
07x01,"Because in the depths of himself, even if he does not know yet, Barney wants to be with you. And if it does not happen, he deserves to know.",Lily
07x01,"Well. Barney, just to make things clear...",Robin
07x01,"I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.",Barney
07x01,Barney... I...,Robin
07x01,"Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.",Barney
07x01,"Wait, you said you'd never recalled.",Robin
07x01,"I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.",Barney
07x01,Yeah.,Robin
07x01,Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling...,Barney
07x01,To tell you how I feel.,Robin
07x01,To tell you how I feel.,Barney
07x01,I know it did not work the first time...,Robin
07x01,I know it did not work the first time...,Barney
07x01,... and it makes no sense...,Robin
07x01,... and it makes no sense...,Barney
07x01,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,Robin
07x01,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,Barney
07x01,Is there a part of you that wants to try again?,Robin
07x01,Is there a part of you that wants to try again?,Barney
07x01,"Baby, I can not do that. I have to tell someone that we are pregnant.",Marshall
07x01,"Eriksen, be strong. Keep it a secret.",Lily
07x01,There are babies everywhere. It's minefield of sweetness. Look at this little bstrd.,Marshall
07x01,"Marshall, stop that. Remains strong. Can not you let me hold a little baby with his little cheeks... so cute... and little arms and little legs... This little bstrd has dimples. We will tell everyone I'm pregnant.",Lily
07x01,Yeah!,Marshall
07x01,Are you okay?,Ted
07x01,No. And you?,Robin
07x01,Not really. Want to talk?,Ted
07x01,Not even a little bit.,Robin
07x01,It might help you feel better.,Ted
07x01,"Okay, well, we'll make a deal. You go first and then I still do not tell you what's wrong.",Robin
07x01,"Okay. All my friends from high school, are there with their wives and children. And me? My appointment is a dirty magazine.",Ted
07x01,"As in high school. Sorry, I had to.",Robin
07x01,"I've always believed in fate, you know? I will go in a magazine Bagel, I would see a pretty girl in the queue reading my favorite novel, whistling the song I had all week in my head, and I would think, Wow, this is perhaps the good.  Now I think I just know that bitch will take the latest Bagel.",Ted
07x01,You've been too focused on your work.,Robin
07x01,"No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight. It's just that every day I think I believe a little less and a little less and less. And... it sucks. What should I do about it, Scherbatsky?",Ted
07x01,You're Ted Mosby. You do it again to believe it.,Robin
07x01,"What, in fate?",Ted
07x01,"A chemistry. If there is alchemy, you just need another thing.",Robin
07x01,What is it?,Ted
07x01,The timing. But the timing is a bitch.,Robin
07x01,"Hey, we always have our market 40 years? If you are still only 40 years...",Ted
07x01,"I'm all yours. Unrelated, architects make a lot?",Robin
07x01,Not enough.,Ted
07x01,Shit.,Robin
07x01,Schmosby to you in two minutes.,Man
07x01,"Ok, promise me two things. One, believe in you again, and two, do not cry during the toast, Schmosby.",Robin
07x01,I promise.,Ted
07x01,We're having a baby.,Lily
07x01,For real?,Robin
07x01,For real.,Lily
07x01,Oh! Oh!,Barney
07x01,A little attention everyone! This is the time for which we are all here tonight. The speech Schmosby!,Voices
07x01,We are here tonight to celebrate love. The love that brings us a new life...,Ted
07x01,Hey!  This is not a whiner. They are tears of joy. Ted is happy for his friends because it's the best guy I know. And do you know why he is happy? For the beautiful young lady is pregnant here.,Marshall
07x01,How did you know...? It must have a secret!,Kelly
07x01,It turns out that...,Ted 
07x01,Will the Browns!,Kelly
07x01,"In the season's Super Bowl, but if they mean the Super Bowl. Go Vikings!",Marshall
07x01,"How dare you? This is my daughter, sort of junk.",Kelly's father
07x01,"You always pay for it all, eh?",Punchy
07x01,Species of junk? This is my son.,Punchy's father
07x01,And that's how Marshall has destroyed the marriage of Punchy. But we did not care. It would be a sixth member in our family.,Ted 
07x01,"No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?",Ted
07x01,"I chose the right tie, huh?",Barney
07x01,"You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck.",Ted
07x01,This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.,Ted 
07x01,"You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?",Barney
07x01,"Oh, I'll cry too.",Ted
07x01,Between.,Barney
07x01,"Ted, the bride wants to see you. Seriously? Will you be wearing this tie?",Lily
07x02,"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?",Marshall
07x02,"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.",Ted
07x02,And Miztva Bar next door.,Robin
07x02,And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.,Lily
07x02,"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!",Marshall
07x02,"Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that...",Ted 
07x02,I've done it again!,Marshall
07x02,But I lost a bit in the story.,Ted 
07x02,What happened to your leg?,Lily
07x02,"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some sympathy points. She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of Man of La Mancha. What do you think?",Barney
07x02,Lose the cast.,Ted
07x02,A one-man show... I love it!,Barney
07x02,Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?,Lily
07x02,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.",Barney
07x02,"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.",Ted
07x02,Is this you?,Woman
07x02,"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.",Ted
07x02,Hi.,Woman
07x02,"That's great, Ted.",Lily
07x02,It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.,Ted
07x02,"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby.  It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of An egg on my face magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.",Ted
07x02,"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.",Ted
07x02,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.",Marshall
07x02,"Children, Garrison Cootes was a major partner of Honeywell  Cootes. One of the largest environmental law firms in the United States.Marshall would have given anything to work there.",Ted 
07x02,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez!  Hello.",Marshall
07x02,"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.",Garrison
07x02,I love the work you do.,Marshall
07x02,It's a...,Garrison
07x02,"No, I mean it.",Marshall
07x02,"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case.",Garrison
07x02,He's interested!,Marshall
07x02,"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.",Garrison
07x02,"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!",Marshall
07x02,"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.",Garrison
07x02,The crocodile you saw?,Marshall
07x02,"He is coming, yes.",Garrison
07x02,"The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.",Ted 
07x02,"Hi Nora, thank you for coming.",Barney
07x02,What happened to your neck?,Nora
07x02,"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...",Barney
07x02,"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.",Nora
07x02,"What? Where? Oh, and shit.",Barney
07x02,Breasts...,Nora
07x02,"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.",Barney
07x02,What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?,Nora
07x02,"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.",Barney
07x02,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait...  I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.",Ted
07x02,Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?,Lily
07x02,Define serious.,Ted

07x02,Do not fight in...,Ted

07x02,What big event?,Ted
07x02,This thing with your uncle.,Robin

07x02,"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet.",Lily
07x02,"Just to be clear, I've done it again!... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.",Marshall
07x02,What does it therefore reference?,Lily
07x02,"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!",Marshall
07x02,Well... it could be anyone...,Lily
07x02,"Oh, God...",Pete
07x02,"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little dick.",Lily
07x02,Pete has a small dick?,Ted
07x02,"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?",Lily
07x02,It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing he rebelled and has struggled!,Marshall
07x02,It's for sure!,Robin
07x02,Look at me! I am a windmill!,Marshall's voice
07x02,"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?",Marshall
07x02,"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head!",Lily
07x02,Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!,Barney
07x02,"Barney, what are you doing here?",Robin
07x02,"Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned.",Barney
07x02,"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.",Ted
07x02,"Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool.",Lily
07x02,"It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again.",Marshall
07x02,And of course...,Ted

07x02,"Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?",Marshall
07x02,"No, I was talking about your pen1s. See you tomorrow.",Garrison
07x02,I got the job.,Marshall
07x02,Yes!,Lily
07x02,And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!,Marshall
07x02,Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.,Lily
07x02,Yes. Hello?,Marshall
07x02,"Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan.",Pete
07x02,"Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday.",Marshall

07x02,You know what? Let her.,Marshall
07x02,"As you wish, Biercules.  Scalpel.",Pete
07x02,You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.,Marshall

07x02,I will remember Pete.,Marshall
07x02,It's a good idea.,Lily
07x02,"That night, I brought Robin Bal.",Ted 
07x02,Thanks for taking me.,Robin

07x02,"Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself.",Robin
07x02,Ok,Ted
07x02,"Children, you can not control when falling in love. It does not take days to think about. When this happens, you know quickly and with absolute certainty. I had forgotten. But reminded myself it was going.",Ted 
07x03,"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?",Marshall

07x03,And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.,Lily

07x03,"Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that...",Ted 
07x03,I've done it again!,Marshall
07x03,But I lost a bit in the story.,Ted 
07x03,What happened to your leg?,Lily
07x03,"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some sympathy points. She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of Man of La Mancha. What do you think?",Barney
07x03,Lose the cast.,Ted
07x03,A one-man show... I love it!,Barney
07x03,Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?,Lily
07x03,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.",Barney
07x03,"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.",Ted
07x03,Is this you?,Woman
07x03,"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.",Ted
07x03,Hi.,Woman

07x03,It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.,Ted
07x03,"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby.  It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of An egg on my face magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.",Ted
07x03,"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.",Ted
07x03,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.",Marshall

07x03,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez!  Hello.",Marshall
07x03,"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.",Garrison
07x03,I love the work you do.,Marshall
07x03,It's a...,Garrison
07x03,"No, I mean it.",Marshall

07x03,He's interested!,Marshall
07x03,"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.",Garrison
07x03,"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!",Marshall
07x03,"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.",Garrison
07x03,The crocodile you saw?,Marshall

07x03,What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?,Nora
07x03,"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.",Barney
07x03,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait...  I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.",Ted
