"Oh, just the Lord's work.",What are you doing here?,"Well, hi guys."
"Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.",But you're Satan.,"Oh, just the Lord's work."
I'm on it.,"Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?","This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here."
"That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.","Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer","Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?"
"Kendall, they're cool.","Come on, we just wanna help out.","On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can."
"OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.","Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.","Kendall, they're cool."
"Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.","Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!","Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town?"
"You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.","Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?",Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot.
"So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.",Lily!,Lily.
"Yeah, Right. Thanks.","Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?","So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn."
"Yeah, what's up?",Barney.,"Yeah, Right. Thanks."
"Yeah, so.",You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.,"Yeah, what's up?"
That's my private personal business!,"All right, let me see that.","Yeah, so."
That's my private personal business.,Court-mandated community service.,That's my private personal business!
I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.,That's my private personal business.,Court-mandated community service.
I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.,You peed on a church?,I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.
"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.","Now, all's right with the world again.","Oh, you are evil."
When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?,"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.","Now, all's right with the world again."
I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,You can't fire a volunteer.
Volunteer of the year!,I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.
"Ted, I'm glad you asked.","I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.",Volunteer of the year!
Right? I told you so.,Surprisingly good.,"Ted, I'm glad you asked."
"OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.","You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.",Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.
I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.,Are you joking?,"OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance."
"Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.","No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.","No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet."
"No, no.",I hope not.,"We're not really doing shots, are we?"
That's ridiculous.,"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",These look kinda like blood.
You gonna put out?,"1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.","Yeah, 2000 a plate."
What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.,You gonna put out?,"1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger."
What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,"OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...",I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.
Daddy's home.,"Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?",What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.
Yeah.,Daddy's home?,Daddy's home.
"Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.","You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.",Yeah.
"Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?","Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...","OK, well, I'll get back to you."
"Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.",That worked. I hate the world.,"Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?"
Totally.,Doo-doo.,"Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do."
Oh yes it can.,"So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.",Totally.
"Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",Interesting,Oh yes it can.
Oh no. I want you to do five shots.,"So, what? You want me to do a shot.","Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style."
"No, don't think. Do.","Barney, I think you've officially...","Oooh, more interesting."
"Drink, drink, drink, drink...","Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.","No, don't think. Do."
"Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...","Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink","Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?"
"Yes! Drink, drink, drink...","Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...","Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink"
"Drink! Drink, drink...","Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?","Yes! Drink, drink, drink..."
"I love it, I love it, I love it.",Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.,"Drink! Drink, drink..."
"Drink, drink, drink, drink...","This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.","Drink, drink, drink..."
No....Dammit.,Oh.,No dibs.
"No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.","Oh, bad idea.",Robin.
"Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.",You'll get this back at the end of class.,I need that phone back.
Hello.,"That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.",What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa.
The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.,Why are you sleeping in our tub?,Hello.
"Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank.","Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?",The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.
"Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.",How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.,"Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank."
"Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.",I'm back baby doll!,"Love you too, buddy."
"All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?","Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.",I'm back baby doll!
"Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.",I think....,"All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?"
Have you met Ted?,Bring it.,"Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride."
You're calling Robin.,Have you met Ted?,Bring it.
"Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.",I'm calling Robin.,You're calling Robin.
"If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.",Oh yeah? What you gonna do?,"Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her."
"Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.",You set me on fire.,Ted!
Who is she?,And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?,You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?
Nice.,I have no idea.,Who is she?
"No, after I hosed you down with a beverage gn, I brought you back here.",You really don't know who that is?,Nice.
"Sleep it off, bra.","Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.",And then Carl filled us in.
"Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.",Did you guys?,It's Robin. That's Robin in there.
"Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again.","Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...","All right, right over here."
Daddy's home.,Wake her up and say what?,You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.
Daddy's home.,"I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.",I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.
"OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.",Or the one after that.,Daddy's home.
Ladies.,"OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.",Or the one after that.
Robin.,Hey guys.,Hi.
Top of the morning.,Hi Robin.,Robin.
I'm good.,I love to snack.,Let's go get a snack.
Question?,"Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.","Oh, man, Ted, this is great."
"But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.","Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.",Question?
"People often ask me Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?","Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...",Mary Beth?
"And the answer is right here... my own, personal get psyched mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",By who? Who asks you that?,"People often ask me Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
Let's do this!,"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.",I am definitely getting psyched.
"Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome.","Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?",Let's do this!
"Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.","Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.",How do you guys know each other?
Party number one!,Party number one!,"Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one."
Natalya.,"So, Barney, who's your new friend?","Oh, no."
She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?,"So, where are you from, Natalya?","Oh, friendly."
Isn't she awesome?,"Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?",She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
"It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?","Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.","Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain."
"Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya.",Party number three. Yeah.,"No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three."
What?!,"Barney, none of us really liked her.","Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya."
"Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?",Sorry.,What?!
What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.,"Oh, dude, not now!",Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.
My finger slipped.,Maybe I should just go home.,What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.
"We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?","Oh, yes. Ted, you rock.","That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!"
"No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.","Yeah, we like hot dogs.","We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?"
"Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.","Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!",That's totally Moby. That's awesome.
"Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?",Wow. You're friendly.,Welcome.
"Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it.","This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise.",Moby's party.
Jan... Aah!,"Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.","Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it."
"But when we said, Hey, Moby, you said, Yeah.",No.,"Moby... the recording artist, Moby."
"No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby.",You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.,Nah.
Why did we think that guy was Moby?,"Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.","No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby."
That's Marshall's phone. Hello.,"I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.",Why did we think that guy was Moby?
"Hey, sexy.","Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.",That's Marshall's phone. Hello.
He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.,"Barney, where's Marshall?","Hey, sexy."
Party number three.,What? Where?,He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.
Moby?! She's upstairs.,"Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!",Party number three.
"Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.",Who was that guy?!,"Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?"
"Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my Get Psyched mix!","No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.","No, but I was just at party number three."
"Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.",I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.,"Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time."
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?,Is this just 'cause you lost your Get Psyched mix?,"Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere."
"The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am.","Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.",I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.
"Give it a rest, Ted.",Marshall!,"Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time."
"Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.",Give what a rest?,"Give it a rest, Ted."
"Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist.","Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.",Marshall!
Come on! Oh! Oh!,"Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on.",Not Moby's party?
"Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?",Natalya?,"Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!"
Cheers. Well said.,"Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.",Come on!
"Here, you need a mint.","I super love you, okay?","I made it, baby."
"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.",Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?,"When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist."
"You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.","Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.",Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?
"Ted, it's a simile.","Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?","You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date."
"Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.","Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.","Yeah, do you need a drink or something?"
"What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.",I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,"On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact."
What?,"Ah, here we go.","This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up."
What up?,A little girl?,"You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes."
"Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.","Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.","Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together."
"Invigorating, thanks.","Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?","Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership."
"But to be fair, she's also hot.","I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.",Don't make me hurt you Ted.
"Yeah, right.","I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.","But to be fair, she's also hot."
"Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?",I did.,"Yeah, right."
"Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...","Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.","Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?"
"A little Barney. And you know what he said?  Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.",A little Barney.,"Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move..."
"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.",Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,"She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father 400,000."
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.","Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.",Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.
"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries."
They all drink vodka cranberries.,"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.
"So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",They all drink vodka cranberries.,"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?"
"No, but I do have a hug.","You got 400,000?","So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?"
Thank you.,"No, but I do have a hug.","You got 400,000?"
"That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.","You know I don't have 400,000, right?","I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry."
"Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.","That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.","You know I don't have 400,000, right?"
"Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.","Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.","Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."
Oww,"Oh, hell no.","Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle."
"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.","Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",Oww
"All right, all right.","Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.","Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes."
"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.","Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",I love you.
Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,What's a sixteen?,"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen."
"Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.","Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.","What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see."
Being single's the best.,I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.
Answer to no one.,Stay out as late as you want.,Being single's the best.
Never having to go to a farmer's market.,The whole world full of endless possibilities.,Answer to no one.
"OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",Never having to go to a farmer's market.,The whole world full of endless possibilities.
"Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, Is it? And usually they say, yes it is.","Wow, the Peace Corps?","And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy."
"Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.","Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.","Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, Is it? And usually they say, yes it is."
"Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.","Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...","Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian."

I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sx.",I have no idea.

"Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office.

"Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.","Yeah, but only, like, second base.","Well, here's hoping he cheats on you."
"So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?","Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.","Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash."
"Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.","Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.","So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?"
"Yeah, must be a 12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.","B... Barney, this says 4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.","Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill."
I most certainly did...,You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,"Yeah, must be a 12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company."
"9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.",What time is the interview?,"I destroyed an 8,000 wedding dress."
Go for Barney.,"Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there.","God, that is so me at 15."
A sasquatch?,"Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.",Go for Barney.
Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.,"That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.",A sasquatch?
"Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...",Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.,Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.
"Yeah, I had it made. Sit.",There's one for awesomeness?,"Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness..."

Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.,"Where, I don't, I don't see...","Oh, steak sauce! For true, though."
"What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",I quit.,"Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it."
Please.,"We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?","What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great."
"Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.","I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",Please.
Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,What?,"Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily."
The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,The package?,Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?
"Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.
Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,She'll be happy.,"Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver."
"Marshall, consider the penguins.","Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?","Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!"
On the wall.,The penguins?,"Marshall, consider the penguins."
"Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold. This is a motivational poster?,On the wall.
"Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.","And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.",Good boy.

Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,"Wow, that was really specific.","What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon."
And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.,So badly.,Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!
Whatever.,Right. Get what done?,And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.
There's always a guy.,Cool. And what guy is this?,Whatever.
You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?,"Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.",There's always a guy.
Nah. I'm so over karaoke.,"So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?",You're right. They're delightful.
"Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,Nah. I'm so over karaoke.
"He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...",I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.,"And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me."
"Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap... Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?","I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.
"So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.","Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...",No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...

No. I know what you want. Magic.,No.,"Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?"
"Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?","Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?","No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out."
"Yeah, she told me already. Go on.",What?,"Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?"
"Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.",Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?,"Yeah, she told me already. Go on."

No. It's 2:30.

All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.",You never had a four-way.,"You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way."
"What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",We're going home.,"I said almost. All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary."
And it begins.,Rock 'n' roll.,"What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?"
"Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?","Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.",It's not ideal.
"No! No, come on.","Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",I think he just spat on me.
"Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the le. We still got the gen. The da. The ry.",Yes!,"No! No, come on."
"Trust that impulse, Ted.","I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",What do you mean could?
You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,"I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time."
"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.","You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.","Yes, that's what I meant by you know. I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go."
Count again.,That's only two.,"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs."
So get an escort.,"Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",Count again.
Why not?,"By escort, you mean prostitute?",So get an escort.
"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",Because... gross?,Why not?
"Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",You really think that's true?,"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession."

Withdrawn.,You just made that up.,"That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute."

"Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.","Yeah, go ahead.",Is that your water? May I?
"Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.","No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.","Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump."

"Yeah, it won't be weird.","No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.","Dude, it's going to be weird."
Because you're going to bring your own date.,Thank you.,"Yeah, it won't be weird."
"Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?","Hello, Barney.",Because you're going to bring your own date.
"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.","Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",So we're going to an award show?
"Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",What the hell?,"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable."

Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.,"Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing."

So you and he aren't...?,I put him in a cab.,"Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?"
"Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",No!,That's her napkin.
"That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",What?,Mary's not really a prostitute.
"No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",So she's not...?,"That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done."
"I know, it was hilarious.","Not funny, dude.",That was not funny.
I did it to prove a point.,Why would you do that?,"I know, it was hilarious."
"Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date.

Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,She slapped me and stormed off.,"Come on, dude, you should be thanking me."
Your room?,"Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.","I'm sorry, dude, it was funny."
"Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?","Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.","Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations."
"Lil, you know I can't promise that.","Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.","Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?"

"That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",All right.,"Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it."
"Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.","No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.","Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday."

Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,"Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.","It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment.

"Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!","Well, funny you should ask...","Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it."
"No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.","That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.","Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!"
Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?,"All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.","Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold."
"St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.","I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.",Cervezas? Did he fall?
I'll save you a seat.,Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,"St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service."
"Susan, her name is Virginia.",Robin.,"Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?"
"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.","Susan, her name is Virginia.",Robin.
"Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",Why?,"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now."
"Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",Wow. You're like a hero.,"So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety."
I'm... oh. .,Why don't you give the guy a hug?,"You poor, brave man."
"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.","My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",I'm... oh. .
"Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",Sure.,"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom."
I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?,"Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!","Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back..."
"Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83 of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.","My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.",I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?
"You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject?

"Ooh, a piano!","Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.","Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great."
What happened to Marshall and Lily?,"Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.","I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman."
"You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.","Teddy bear, oh...","Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving."
"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? .",We had our first fight.,"Well, we just had our first fight."
No.,"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.","And if we don't get it, we could go under."
"Yeah, you did.","Wow, so it's the whole package.","Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front."

Had to.,"Yeah, you did.","Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft."
Can we talk about something else?,"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",What the hell comes before Q?
"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?","You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",Can we talk about something else?
"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.","That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome.

This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?"
"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",Robin thinks so.,Your job's not boring.
"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",I love it when you quote Scripture.,"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God."
"That's 'cause you're always like...  Ted Mosby, architect. Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.","Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.","I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies."
"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. Ted Mosby, architect. Trust me.","Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy.

Ted? He's at work.,"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.
Awesome story. As per usual.,How did you get here?,Ted? He's at work.
"Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.","Yes, she did.",Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.
"Yeah, stay",Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.,"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands."
"Yeah, you did.","Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.","Yeah, stay"
"Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.","Yeah, had to. See ya.","Yeah, you did."
Ted Mosby... Architect.,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.","Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave."
But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,Ted Mosby... Architect.,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way."
Galloping.,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?","Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!"
It is tonight.,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.
"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",It is tonight.,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted."
I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole using my real name thing.,But why would you use Ted's name?,"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here."
"And thus ended this chapter of, Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand. Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.","Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",And that's why I avoid relationships.
"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a A. A... A... I'll just put resident.

"Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident.

The fortress of barnitude? No way.,"What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.",Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.

"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.","Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.","Man, that guy is a total, well..."

Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.
"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",So you're going back over there?,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.

It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!,Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that A!"
"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",I'm sorry.,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap."
I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
"Really? Laid, you say?","Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.","I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, dude, my semester is gonna be this."
She hot?,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.","Really? Laid, you say?"
And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",She hot?
"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",A what?,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man."
"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",I didn't challenge you to have sx with...,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge."
"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her."
"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.","Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.","Man, that guy is a total, well..."
"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?","Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.","Okay, let's take a look.

"Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...","Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.","Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?"
Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Tell me what you want or get out.,"Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa..."
"Oh, my god. Incredible.","Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!","Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers."
C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Hmm... C minus.,"Oh, my god. Incredible."
"I know, I know.","I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.
"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",You claim to have so much sx. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,"I know, I know."
"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.","Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.","Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again."
I think I'm falling in love with you.,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.","Just let it go, man. You're making things worse."
What? No.We had sx yesterday.,"Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",I think I'm falling in love with you.
Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.
"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",So you're going back over there?,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.
I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",So you're going back over there?
"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.","Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.
"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",He broke his hip.,What happened?
"Yeah, she was.",Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.,"Professor Lewis, hi."
"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that A!",B plus.,"Yeah, she was."

"Hey, guys.",You got it.,"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?"
"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",Wow. A pedicure.,"Hey, guys."
"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine."
"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",So are you in or not?,"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?"
"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.
"Oh, uh, once or twice.",You been here before?,"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend."
"Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",Barney!,"Oh, uh, once or twice."
Yeah.,I'm ready. Let's get married.,The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?
"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil.","Yeah, okay.","Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one."
"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?","Oh, yeah, definitely.","No, I mean do you want to play craps."
"Marshall, I'm your best man.","Barney, no.",What did you just say?
"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",Right here.,You're not my best man.
Of course.,"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",18 minutes...
Unbelievable!,Dude!,And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.
Bright side: the bachelor party continues!,"About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.","You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?"
Hi.,"Hey, it's Barney! Barney!","No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt."
See you.,Legen-...-dary!,Hi.
A... Chinese guy?,What the hell was that?,See you.
Vultures.,"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.","Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long."
"Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.",Sweet.,"Yes, I'll leave it on."
"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.","Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.","Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen."
They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sx in the closet. What? We're under oath.,"All right, what was that look? What's going on?",I have.
"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.","No, we're not.",They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sx in the closet. What? We're under oath.
"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,"Yeah, we are. He's a judge."
I can get us that money.,"Deal. 5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",What?
Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,How?,I can get us that money.
"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called Shing Hasabu Shing. Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?
"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.","No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.","Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time.

I think I can win us that money."
"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.","I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.","No, you don't."
"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!","Thanks, Barney.",Wow. It's beautiful.
Why can't I do it just a little?,"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?","Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!"
"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?
"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.","Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?
"Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",Why?,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either."
"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.","No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.","Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?"
"Come on, let's go.","Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.","No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt."
To the Willowbrook Mall!,"All right, I'm in.","Come on, let's go."
Why not?,"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.","Come on, it'll be fun."
"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.","What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?","Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure."
"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",The 'oh' moment?,"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment."
Oh.,It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.,"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker."
Oh.,"I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.",Oh.
Oh.,I just turned 30.,Oh.
"So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",Oh.,I just turned 30.
"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.","Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",I used to be a dude.
I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,It's true. They tell each other everything.,"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox."
Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,Try me.,I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you
Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?
"OK, Seattle.","Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.
Damn.,"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.","OK, Seattle."
"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",What happened next?,"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway."
"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do prn, wait for it, ography.",You know?,"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?"
They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",No.
"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.","Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.","So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?"
'Cause it's prn.,Thank you Barney.,"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it."
"20,000 says it's prn.",Robin is not in prn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,I need another beer.
"Well then, what do you have?","I don't have 20,000.","20,000 says it's prn."
I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,No.,Well.
Your hand is monstrous.,OK.,I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.
I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?","Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?"
"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of prn from Canada I have to go through.",I can see my hand print on your face.,"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school."
Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of prn from Canada I have to go through."
"Canadian prn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go oat of my mind.","Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch prn.",Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.
"You, you got something to say to me?",He moved there for business.,You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.
Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.","Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine..."
Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.,One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,Three?
So I just got a very interesting phone call.,"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.
I know Robin's secret.,What are you talking about?,So I just got a very interesting phone call.
"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.",What?,I know Robin's secret.
"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.","That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.",What?
What?,Yeah. No I don't.,"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."
"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,What?
"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.","Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.
"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.","Barney, don't, okay.","Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."
Yeah you were.,I wanna stress that I was young.,I don't wanna get slapped again.
They never do.,And I didn't know any better.,Yeah you were.
It always does.,And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,They never do.
"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",Oh my God.,"Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?"
I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.","No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?"
"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.","So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall
Aw.,"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.","Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone."
Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!",That's one.
"Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?","I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall ...","No, she doesn't wanna wait."
"Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?",- No.,- Nope.
"One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?","- No, thanks.",- Nope.
Hi. Have you met me?,"It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.",Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.
"Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.",- No.,"Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements."
"- Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.",- You have a brother?,- Hey!
That's what I just said.,He's exactly like Barney.,"- Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever."
Is gimme five back?,"Awesome, as per yoozh. I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.Legendarier. And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five.","Anyway, James, how have you been?"
"Guys, gimme five is back!","Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.",Is gimme five back?
Please.,"So, I have to ask, there's a story here.","- You, too."
"I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.",So what are you guys gonna do tonight?,Stop asking me! You know what you two are? You're little racists!
It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.,And then there was the time they scored the brother sister combo.,"Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement. But I will say this: way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have."
"Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?",And Barney always returned the favor.,"What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- ulous. Okay?"
"Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?","Oh, my God, I do!","Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?"
"Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.","Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?","Oh, my God, I do!"
"Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?","So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.",Testify!
I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?,"Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man.","Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?"
- Let's ride.,"Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?",I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?
"- Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.","- Get off me, you pig!","- Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!"
- What? What?,- What? What?,"- Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers."
Let me know if he bothers you again.,Cool.,- What? What?
Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.,Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.,Let me know if he bothers you again.
- Boiling hot.,- Break.,"Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs."
Have you met my brother?,"- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?",Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.
"Oh, hello. Have a drink.",Have you met my brother?,"- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?"
What's gonna kll me? What's going on?,This is gonna kll Barney.,"Oh, my God! He is in a couple."
"No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.",B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?,What's gonna kll me? What's going on?
"That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had sx with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had sx with anyone in a bathroom stall.","We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.","No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean."
"No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...","And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.","That's ridiculous!

Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious."
"What the hell, I'm in. High five!",I'm in.,I'm in.
Sorry. Solemn low five.,"Dude, we're at a wake.","What the hell, I'm in. High five!"
"Hey, take this key and swallow it.","As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.",Sorry. Solemn low five.
"Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.",What? No.,"Hey, take this key and swallow it."
"I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.","Lots more, no.","Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time."
"Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.",Just went up to eight.,Are you serious?
Where are you going?,Not until game time.,"Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries."
What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.,Pick up the hot wings.,Where are you going?
"Sir, who won the Super Bowl?",I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.,"Okay, okay. You win."
You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!,Sorry. I missed the game.,"Sir, who won the Super Bowl?"
"Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.",I... don't really follow sports.,You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!
"You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?","Yeah, I get that a lot.","Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God."
"But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!","The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.","You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?"
No...!,"Dance, my friend. Dance.","But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!"

I met Emmitt Smith today.,I almost got fired today.,"Hey, so check this out: I got extorted by a five-year-old today."
"Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...","Yeah, go ahead, Barney.",I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
"I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?","And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?","Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game..."
"Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...","50-50, give or take.","I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?"
Training for a marathon.,"Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.","Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow."
You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.,What?,Training for a marathon.
Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.,"You're kidding, right?",You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.
Absolutely.,"So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.
"Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.","Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.","Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers."
"50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it 10,000.","Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.","Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles."

"What up, non-finishers?","Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",It's really him.
"Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.","Wow. Very impressive, Barney.","What up, non-finishers?"
So where's my 50 bucks?,I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.,"Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won."
"Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.","All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",So where's my 50 bucks?
Wow. You know I really should check out this subway. Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.,"Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.","Huh?

"Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",Hello?,So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.
"I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.","What, what are you talking about?","Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway."
"Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.","I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.","What, what are you talking about?"
"My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",86th street.,"Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean."
"Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",Best 50 bucks I ever spent.,Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.
"Ted, Ted.",All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.,"Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?"

Ted!,Barney?!,Douche.
No...!,Hey!,Ted!
I can't go. I've got this thing.,"You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",Are you serious?
A pen1s.,What thing?,I can't go. I've got this thing.
I don't know. Is she fat?,"Okay, so you have to have sx with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!","Well, you're...confusing."
I-I don't take flyers.,Hot off the presses!,"Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat."
That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?,You took one two seconds before you walked in here.,I-I don't take flyers.
"Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...",Fine. It's a flyer from my play.,That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?
"Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.","Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.","Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid..."
"Yes, you should break up.","Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.","Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this.

"Oh, God, why is this part of the story?","I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.","Mm, we should get down to the bar."
What's wrong with her?,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!","Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist."
"What word, moist?",She hates that word.,What's wrong with her?
"Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.","Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.
I vote they can stay. Check out the jackass in the parachute pants is a good icebreaker.,Yes!,I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old
"Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.,"Sorry, buddy, it's a no for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back."
I side with Robin.,"All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.
"Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",What?,I side with Robin.
"From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.","Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?","So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in."
I know where I don't want to sit.,Where do you guys want to sit?,"From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory."
I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.,"Guys, four together!",I know where I don't want to sit.
No? Okay.,Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.,I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
I am outta here.,I am Rage... Envy!,I... am Greed.
"Wow, Lily, that sucked!","And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, Now we are really cookin'!","Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer."
"What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",Barney!,"Wow, Lily, that sucked!"
"Yeah, if you're a Smurf.","No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.","What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends."
"Oh, really? You would?","You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.","Yeah, if you're a Smurf."
"Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",Yes.,"Oh, really? You would?"
Even I wouldn't do that.,What's the matter with you?,She's not getting rid of the dogs.
"Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",I miss Jebediah.,"You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog."

Moist.,That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.,Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.
I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.,And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.,Moist.
"Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",And then it just got weird.,I never get picked for audience participation.
"Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?","Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",And when that didn't work...
"Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting","No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.","Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?"

"Well, I'm trying, but it's...",Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.,It is not insane.

You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out.

My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.","So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore.

"Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",How long is this list?,Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross harp player off my list.

And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?","Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.

You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called Eggs Marshall, and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy."

I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.,Hmm?,Ted?
"See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.","Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.",I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.
"Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.",Hmm.,"See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now."
"Nothing, buddy.",A butterfly?  What?,He's gonna say it.
"Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.",Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God!  I have a tattoo.,"Nothing, buddy."
"You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.",Tramp stamp?,"Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp."
"Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.",No no no no no no no. Give me this.,"Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait."
Go for Barney.,"Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before.  It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.","No, Ted... you're bigger."
What is it?,"Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.",Go for Barney.
What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?,Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.,What is it?
No.  No!,What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?,Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.
I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.,"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.","So, beeing married, different? Not different?"
Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?,"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...","No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly."
"Yeah. Wait, why?",I am such a jerk.,Thanks.
"That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.","Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.",Marshall brownies.
"No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...","Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.","That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen."
"Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.",And here I am at the drum circle.,A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!
"You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker.",Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.,"Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know."
"What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.",Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.,"You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker."
"Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a Best if banged by sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being Unevolved Robin, the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.","I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.","Man, this is like Where's Waldo of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo."
"I'm telling you, within three days...",I'm just happy Robin's happy.,"Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a Best if banged by sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being Unevolved Robin, the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted."
"Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association.","Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.","I'm telling you, within three days..."
"This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.",What are we talking of? Baseball?,My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.  b
That guy...,"My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother.  And that's all I remember until the hospital.","M., Atm Pin Code: 5-4-5-9. Teacher's pension account: a-3-9-3-2. Cancel Vogue. L."
"Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?",Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.,That guy...
No. Because he's from out of town.,He's better looking than us.,"Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?"
Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?,"Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.",Mmm.
"Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?","Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.",Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?
"Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted.",Oh.,"Actually, it's on its own island."
"Hi, Colleen.","Hi, um, I'm Colleen.","Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted."
"Hi, Lindsay.",This is Lindsay.,"Hi, Colleen."
Yeah.,"Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.","No, what is it?"
Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?,"Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch?",Yeah.
All right.,We'll see you tomorrow.,I think it's cool.
Okay. All right.,I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.,All right.
"This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke.","I'm gonna go, too.",I'm going to run to the restroom.
"Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude.",Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.,"This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke."
Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?,I'm looking at you. What?,"Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude."
"Nice.  Nice. Hey, nice.","All right, Ignatius, one more hour.",Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?
"Knock, knock.",Hey. Our friends invited us to a party. You guys want to come along?,"Nice.  Nice. Hey, nice."
"Yes, we do.",Who's there?,"Knock, knock."
"Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps.","Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee.

This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand? is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I...  And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked.","Yes, we do."
"Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands.",A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get klled.,148th and Brook Avenue.
Well. I only had traveler's checks.,"There were three of them, at least two gns... they took all our money.","Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands."
What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?
"Thank God we're alive sx. It's even better than I can't believe you just proposed to me sx, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.","Thank God, we're alive sx.",What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.
Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?,Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know?,Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover.
Theodore.,"You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?",Yeah.
Teddy?,New Jersey?,Yep.
"Oh, no.","Oh, no. Oh, no.","Yeah. But don't worry, it's pretty much New York."
"You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc...","Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to pretty much New York? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",And how would you know?
"Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?",Ew.  Can we get a ride?,"You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc..."
"Welcome home, Scherbatsky.","After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin.","No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something."
Listening.,"Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.","Welcome home, Scherbatsky."
"Use your words, Ted.",Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.,"Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story from back before I met your mother. But there are some stories you tell and some stories you don't."
The belt?,"OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.","Use your words, Ted."
But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.,The belt.,The belt?
Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.,"Yes, advantage Ericksen.",But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.
You take too long to get ready,"What? We agreed, I suited up.",Can't go. Tournament.
And then he starts on his hair. Ace.,"Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.","What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look."
"Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.","Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?",And then he starts on his hair. Ace.
Yes.,Really?,"Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes."
"So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?","You just made the list, bitch.",I saw it first.
"FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.","Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.","You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?"
Stinson.,Shekwakie.,"FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough."
"Yeah, we're not gonna make it.","All right, the beers are here.",Stinson.
"Yeah, pants are off.","Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?","Yeah, we're not gonna make it."
That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.","OK, guys, be cool."
Stinson.,That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean."
"You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.","I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.",Stinson.
So you now have two on the line?,"So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.","You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape."
Go for the new girl.,And I don't know which one to go for.,So you now have two on the line?
"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.",Go for the new girl.,And I don't know which one to go for.
Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...,New girl? What new girl?,"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove."
"That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.",I thought we were in for the evening.,"OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out."
"No way, no way, no way!",It's a tricycle.,Three
Put him on speaker.,"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.","No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle."
So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?,Put him on speaker.,"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts."
"That's right, it's resplendent.",You actually bought a belt.,"Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?"
"I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...","It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.","That's right, it's resplendent."
"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?","Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?","If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s."
"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.",Yes.,"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?"
"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?",Yes.,"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds."
Ted?,What? No.,"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?"
"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars.","No, but fifty will.",There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?
I cannot allow Ted to do this.,What are you doing?,"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney."
Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,"Why, why?",I cannot allow Ted to do this.
"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.","But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.
"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?","I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.","But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting."
I'll get the video camera.,OK.,"Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel."
OK then.,Get out!,I'll get the video camera.
Oh my God.,Wish me luck.,"OK, take it."
Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.,"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.","I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on."
"Oh no, the night's ruined!","So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?","What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night."
Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,"No, baby, it's not.","Oh no, the night's ruined!"
"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",Why would you do that to yourself?,Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?
"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.","See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?","Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me."
"No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",It won't?,"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn."
That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,Why would I want to tire them out?,So exhausted.
"OK, wait for it.","OK, what the hell.",I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.
Yes you can.,"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",Yeah.
"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.",I'll see you on the other side.,All right.
What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.",I'll see you on the other side.
"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it."
"You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!","You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.
"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?","Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.","You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!"
"Ted, belt.","Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?","Some stories you tell, some stories you don't."
Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,"Ted, belt.","Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?"
She's totally hot and really fun.,What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.,What's his 'but'?
But she has a dead tooth.,She's totally hot and really fun.,What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.
"If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!","Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",I'm still convinced she klled my turtle.
Shotgun.,I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vg1n,"Well, you don't wanna have them."
Nice.,"You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.",Shotgun.
But she's Canadian.,But she's a gn nut.,But she's afraid of commitment.
I can't think of anything.,But she didn't like Field of Dreams.,But she's Canadian.
"OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.",You don't have a 'but'.,I can't think of anything.
The ultimate ice breaker.,Why?,"OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch."
"A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.",The ultimate ice breaker.,Why?
We got bit.,"So, what are the eye patches for?","A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please."
They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!,Both of us.,On the eye? Barney: Yes.
"Oh, Theodore...","OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.",Don't tell anyone I said that.
"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.","Oh, Theodore...","OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches."
Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.,"Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.","...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game."
Wow.,"Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.",Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.
"OK, Marshall.",I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.,"Yeah, so?"
Which one of us has more game?,Yes.,"OK, Marshall."
"What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.","Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",Which one of us has more game?
"OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.","You're joking. I have mad game, bra.","Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league."
"Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,"I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant."
"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,"First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day."
There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,Fine.,"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad."
That's good too.,Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...
How about her?,That's good too.,Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.
"Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",You're on.,How about her?
I win.,"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.
"Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",How?,I win.
I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.","Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot."
"By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",Get out of my way.,"Ted, she's leaving."
"Whatever, Ted.",You see this. Game face.,"Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile."
"Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.","Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?","Whatever, Ted."
Nice.,"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have sx twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had sx a total of...wait for it...","Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song."
Doesn't count.,"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sx and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.",Nice.
"OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.","You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had sx once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.",Totally counts.
"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.","Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.","OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know."
"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on.","We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago.

"Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.","Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?","No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on."

"Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...","I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now.

Please don't slap me.,"Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.",I'm not scared.
"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!","I'm sorry, what?",Please don't slap me.

"That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!",Yes!,Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?
"Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?","That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!",Yes!
"Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.",It's karma.,"Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?"
"My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.","Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?","Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good."
"Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.","Come on, let's see the list.",I have one. It's called my marriage license.
"This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?","Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.","Come on, let's see the list."
"All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.",How many of these girls know they're being photographed?,"I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face."
Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.,"Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.","Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you."
This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.",Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.
"The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.",This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot."
"Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.","Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!",It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!
"Okay, toss up. Thought I was Jorge Posada, or You have my dead wife's kidney?",Damn it!,12 hours to live!
That's true...,She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!,Jorge Posada!
"Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, Girl who thought I owned Google, up against the number seven seed, Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.",I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.,Lost at sea!
"Yeah, she did.",She got the bends!,You're kidding me!
I'm going with Evil Twin.,"Barney, you're the tiebreaker.",Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
"Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.",You're kidding me!,I'm going with Evil Twin.
Come on! Marshall?,Is that the blackboard from my classroom?,Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.
Mosby?,I'm tired and sad.,Come on! Marshall?
"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.","I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.",Mosby?
"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.",You guys stole my blackboard!,"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar."
What do you mean no?,No.,"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell."
"Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had sx with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.","That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, I'm sorry.",What do you mean no?
"Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kll me!","Barney, you're doing this.","Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had sx with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car."
"If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.","Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?","Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kll me!"
"Look, Meg, we need to talk.",What are you doing here?,"If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River."
And I forgive you. I love you.,"It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.","Look, Meg, we need to talk."
"So you remember who this one is, right?","No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...","Oh, my God! I love you, too!"
"Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...",Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.,"So you remember who this one is, right?"
"Ah, there she is.","Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.","Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I..."
"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.,"Ah, there she is."
"Anna, hi.",I'm making a scrapbook.,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"
What Web site?,"Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.","Anna, hi."
"You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.",Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.,What Web site?
She's...,"Okay, which one is this again?","And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!"
Is it her?,Larney! Die!,She's...
You look good. Have you lost weight?,Smile.,Die!
"We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.",You look good. Have you lost weight?,Smile.
"But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.",That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.,"Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!"
Holly.,Barney.,She's gonna kll you.
"Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.","And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.","No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future."
"No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,Fourth of July? We started dating in June.
That's not a bad idea.,"Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.","No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is."
I'm in.,"No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?
"Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!","...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.","Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily..."
"Hey, there, how are you doing?","I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.","Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful."
"Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?","Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.","Hey, there, how are you doing?"
"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.","Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.","Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?"
"Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin."
"Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have sx.","No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.","Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?"
I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands?  Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?,"Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go."
"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",Are you okay?,Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.
What? What?,"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.","I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things.

I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize."
So I apologized for nothing?,"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",What? What?
"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",A new car!,"Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself."
I just called it.,You can't call shotgun for eternity.,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!"
I call that I can call things!,"You can't just call things, barney.",I just called it.
"What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?","Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",He screamed at me.
"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.","Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?","Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life."
"Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!"
Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,"Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...
Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.","God, you're hot right now."
"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.","It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.","Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?"
"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.","Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.","It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it."
"Oh, snap.","You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.","You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment..."
Does this help?,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.",He peed on the conference table?
"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",Does this help?,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on."
"No, no, of course not... he died.",That's it? that's the end of the story?,"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley."
"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.","How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?","No, no, of course not... he died."
"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",Chain of screaming?,"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming."
"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",I thought it was a chain of screaming.,"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming."
"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",So it's not a circle.,"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm."
"Oh, God.","Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...","Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?"
"Hey, marshall.","After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.","There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?"
"If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?",How long have you been sitting there?,"Hey, marshall."
What do you want?,"Yeah, I was just about to order.","If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?"
"A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.","Okay, friends, what do you like?",A sandwich and gravy fries.
"Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.","No, I didn't want meatloaf.",Very good.
"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.","No, I don't.","Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else."
I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,Who would I even scream at?,"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive."
"Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.","I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.","Okay, so... Then I say to Barney..."
Marshall.,"One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.","Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries."
"Hey, what are you guys doing out here?","No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!","I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so..."
"Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.","Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!","Oh sweet, can I get a toot?"
"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.","Well, that's just not true.","Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this."
"Well, that's funny, cause I did!",You can't call shotgun for eternity.,"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity."
"A 20 tip, really, for that waiter?","Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!",It's case by case.
"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.","I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...","A 20 tip, really, for that waiter?"
Yell at me.,What?,"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me."
"What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot.","I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.",Yell at me.
Yeah.,"Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?","What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.","This is me yelling at you, Barney.",Yeah.
"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.","This is me yelling at you, Barney!","I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away."
"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.",You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!,"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt."
Yes.,Your mom's a slut!,"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry."
Keep going.,"Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!",Yes.
"Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.",I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!,Keep going.
"No, I'm kidding... keep going.","Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...","Okay, now, well, that's just not cool."
"Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.",I'm sorry.,Dude!
"Ted, screaming never solves anything.","Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!","How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?"
Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?,And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.,Totally. What's the occasion?
"Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?",Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.,"No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend."
"Sounds to me like he gave you your first O, Canada! face.","No, it wasn't like that.","So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?"
Did you ride his Zamboni?,"...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...","Um, something about fur trapping."
Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.,"Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.","Yeah, I'm also oot. Okay, now I'm really out."
You're starting out with two big ones right there.,"Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.","Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser."
"I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?","No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.","So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin."
Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.",I know. I'm sorry.
"So, Simon, how did you guys meet?",Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream."
"I'm sorry. I've seen Let's Go to the Mall about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.","Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.",Starred in it is more like it.
There's another video?!,"No, I was in the other one.","I'm sorry. I've seen Let's Go to the Mall about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it."
"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.",There's another video?!,"No, I was in the other one."
"All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.",No.,"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape."
Michelle? She sounds hot.,"You know who gets really bad revertigo?  Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.","Yeah, I don't know about revertigo."
No. What about Lily and Michelle?,You don't know about Lily and Michelle?,Michelle? She sounds hot.
What...  Do they make out?,"Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.","You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while."
Finish him!,The coup de grace.,"He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon."
"I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.",For reals.,I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.
All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?,"One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.","No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!"
"Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.",Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.,All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?
"Ooh. Really? Oh! Oh, come here.","No, tonight.","Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago."
"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.","It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.","Ooh. Really? Oh! Oh, come here."
No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.","Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again?

Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?,Thanks.

"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.  But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small","I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women.

"And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.","P.S., not sitting great.","Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway."

You're the sexless innkeeper.,Westchester. Why?,"Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?"
"Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?",What the hell is the sexless innkeeper?,"Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!"

She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, where do you live?And she said, one block south.. I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper.

No way. You made that up.,"Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said classy, but her eyes whispered sin. She said, you're a teacher? I said, yes, indeed. I must have you, she moaned.I'm turned on by tweed. With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper.

Correct.,I want to say- Jefferson?,"And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American."

This Canadian.  Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,How Canadian?,You went Canadian.
"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...","How did you find me, anyway?","We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams Rich title double bill in Toronto."

"God, you're still drunk.","Barney, I'm not taking the test.","You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours."
"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test.

I always will be.","God, you're still drunk."
It's like an entire country without a tailor.,I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.,I can't believe you guys are closing.
What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No please or thank you for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.,I'm not American.
And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.
"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.","Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.","It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away."
"Okay, that's it.  Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a tie.","When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change.

Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",Okay. Let's listen to it again.,Listen to the Sparky book again.
Hmm.,"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, Yeah, America's cool.","Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me.

"Wait, you can do that?","And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too. I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",Hmm.
I see.,"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.","Wait, you can do that?"

Look what I saw yesterday.,Not at all.,I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.
I gotta go.,No problem.,"Baby, you can wash it?"
"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.",I gotta go.,No problem.
They have a big problem.,There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.,"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum."

I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.,"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?","According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart."
Let me ask you a question.,"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep.

"So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.",Not really.,"Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?"
"You argue. Robin, we do not fight.","But if I said that, we will play, so...","So what is the problem of Lily, not yours."
"No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...",Of course I do.,"You argue. Robin, we do not fight."
It works in 100 of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.,So when you think you will play and you get up you go?,Why is there a bag of pants marked April 2008 in your closet?
Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.,I can not believe Robin supports it.,This is not true.
"There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.","But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.",Mad.
Okay.,Go to the basics!,"Barney, you came home!"
"Thank you, doll.",Okay.,Go to the basics!
"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel is what you will paint the?","Honey, you're going to wash it?","Thank you, doll."
"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.",No. Of course not.,"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks.

It's because you're a woman.,Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.,"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing."
Of course not.,I do not even know why we laugh!,It's because you're a woman.
"Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.","Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.",Are you kidding me.
"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.","Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.","Wait, Ted. Listen to the man."
"Now, turn around.",You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.,"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes."
The piercing was cool.,"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.",He's right.
You're welcome.,I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!,You just said the opposite!
I told you.,I think that's true.,Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.
"Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!",Thank you.,"Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them."
Okay.,How was the trip?,The ski babes are back!
"It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?",What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?,"We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags."
"short, and your weekend?",We all came out a year.,"It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?"
What happened to the I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love?,"I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?","Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies.  You see? It's just..."
"You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.","Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.","Do not do that, please."
What do you eat?,This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...,Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.
"Hey, Ro-Ro.","Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.","Well shit, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!"

How will Marshall and Lily?,"And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.",They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.
"You and your big, huge heart.","Those two worry me, really.",How will Marshall and Lily?
What do you mean by that?,Enough. The game is over.,"You and your big, huge heart."
Who the hell is Phil?,Phil told me.,How would you know that?
All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?,I'm Phil. 12-B.
I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.,All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?

The tie mrderd by Robin.,All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.,And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.

"Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.",I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!,Barney for the millionth time...
We need advice.,"No, but what is your favorite.",You've done for me?

Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.,You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?,How are you?
"The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!",Why change your mind?,I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.
It all started a week ago.,"Okay, big guy, tell me all along.","The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!"
I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.,It all started a week ago.,"Okay, big guy, tell me all along."
Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.,Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.,I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.
It was not my best tie.,But this is merely a tie.,Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.
"So, right after that, I took her home.",Right.,It was not my best tie.
"Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.","When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.","So, right after that, I took her home."
"What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.",Good night.,"Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow."
"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.","Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.",It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.
Continuous. Continues.,"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really sx, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.","It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word sx?"
Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.,It's the cashmere?,Did she used an excuse for physical contact?
"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",12 microns. I like the tight fibers.,Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.
She did it too!,"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",12 microns. I like the tight fibers.
"You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.","And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week?",She did it too!
Did you just say you got a kid!,"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.","You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail."
Completely.,You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.,Did you just say you got a kid!
Of course. Well...,Or the second. Or the third.,Completely.
Just tell me how!,Or the fourth.,Of course. Well...
"Excuse me, someone is using this stool?",17.,Just tell me how!
"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...","If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.",That is: no sx before hot date 17th.
I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.,From Robin is Robin.,"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted..."
I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.,"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",But what are you doing?
"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and...","I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.","Thank you, Mike. Think about it."
"Spoilers. Regardless, we did.",It does.,"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and..."
Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?,"I know, but the song is rather catchy.",How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.
Tell me.,There is another option... but you're not ready.,Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?
A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",Tell me.
Okay.,"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.",A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?
You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?,Let me do it. I will plan everything.,Okay.
What are you doing?,Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...,You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?
They look at us.,You just gotta make him understand...,What are you doing?
Really? You really gonna do that?,How important it is for you...,They look at us.
It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?,"In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.",Really? You really gonna do that?
Why did you do that?,"I'm fine, I'm fine.",I think it is the toilet.
Why are you angry against me?,"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.",Why did you do that?
The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.,You were a real asshle to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.,Why are you angry against me?
"What, she is upset?","Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.",Typical of a guy.
You should have seen.,Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.,"Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail."
We go back home...,I'm going.,You should have seen.
I can not believe that Robin is upset.,We go back home...,I'm going.
I did worse after the premiere of The Phantom Menace.It's been like that since we broke up?,And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.,I can not believe that Robin is upset.
I know where.,"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.",I did worse after the premiere of The Phantom Menace.It's been like that since we broke up?
I know you're upset.,"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.",I know where.
You sure you're not upset?,"What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my fcking heart.",I know you're upset.
You're not another number for me.,Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?,You sure you're not upset?
"I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?","And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.",You're not another number for me.
"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.","Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.","I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?"
I promise.,Do not sleep with Anita.,"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want."
It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.,Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?,I promise.
I wanted to call you.,"Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.",It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.
"I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.","I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?",I wanted to call you.
No.,"I see. You try the trick of no. You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.","I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no."
No.,The 11th?,No.
No.,The fifth?,No.
No.,Tonight?,No.
No.,This evening before dinner?,No.
I'm sorry. The answer is no.,Go.,Yeah.
Here is my story.,"Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.",I'm sorry. The answer is no.
I hope so too.,This is a  500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.,Here is my story.
Why?,I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.,"Children, have you seen the photo album of Lily... Bound in leather, acid-free paper, adorable handwritten captions. And most importantly, the group photo. Nice picture, eh? But what you do not see are the 10 seconds before this photo was taken."
How dare you?,Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.,"You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?"
It's true.,It's so rude.,How dare you?
"No, it was me. And I meant it.",I would say Amanda.,"Too cute. Lily, guess who wrote it. You look really nice."
I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!,Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.,"Really? So, let us walk bitch Street Shuffle."
You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?,"Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, Folks, this may be good. And this is not the only maybe good. Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and It's good Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... It proves that you selected the eyes closed Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance.","I remember, this is Sarah."
Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from gns N'Roses!,You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?,"Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, Folks, this may be good. And this is not the only maybe good. Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and It's good Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... It proves that you selected the eyes closed Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance."
"And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?",Group Photo!,Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from gns N'Roses!
False!,"It was there, we know the end.","And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?"
And me too. He has how many hands?,Oh? So do I.,The funny for this photo. I plottait ass.
"Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.",Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.,"Actually, sorry, man. I had you taken to Lily."
"Nope, not at all.",It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.,"Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always."
"Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.",And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.,"Nope, not at all."
You really put a knot!,They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.,"He was right. Your uncle Marshall is many things well, but for the pictures, it's terrible."
Of course.,"A crisp, Barney?",You really put a knot!
You sure?,I! A photo ugly.,Of course.
It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.,No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?,You sure?
You sure?,"It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected? Mouse, mtherfcker! I!","It will not surprise you, but the rest of the trip was horrible. I did a picture of a romantic kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, I actually had. It was just between Karen and Francis, our server yesterday."
"The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.",Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!,You sure?
They would be if Marshall was not on it.,"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.",Shut up.
It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.,I think Lori's age made him very wise.,"Thank you, Lil."
What? Where?,It's a hole in your jacket?,"Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them."
Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...,"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.",Your brain is too predictable associations.
I love traveling.,No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.,Yes!
"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.",Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?,I love traveling.
"Ted, a blonde, it's easy.",You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.,"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon."
"Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.","Ted, a blonde, it's easy.",You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.
"So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space.","But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.","Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane."
"I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!",Why are you lying all the time?,"So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space."
"I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, stop eating pizza. Marshall: Why? Doc: To you examine.  But seriously, we laugh because we love you.",Our coupons are your effigy.,I even caught a pizza in the shower.
Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said Hands up! ?,Did you get mugged?,That's good.
It was downright terrifying.,It was downright terrifying.,It's good. It's good.
I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.,What are you doing?,It was downright terrifying.
I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.,"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a gn. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.",It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.
It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you.,"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?",I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.
So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!,"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.","I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a gn at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would..."
I do not ask where he kept his weapon.,He assaulted you naked?,It's good. It's good.
You're telling us...,It's good. It's good.,Watch out. Come any closer.
You've been mugged by a monkey?,For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.,What you got mugged...
Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.
New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,"Hi, friends. What's new?",Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.
"No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",Okay. That's what happened.,What's happening?
You're right. The banana was on the floor.,"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.","No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana..."
"Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",Was not... Was not banana banana.,You're right. The banana was on the floor.
I've just been mugged.,You've been mugged by a monkey.,Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?
That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,What?,I've just been mugged.
It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.,That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,What?
"Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...",Neil? Neil!,My poor darling.
"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",You've just mugged?,You're not supposed to be on a space mission?
And it was the best thing in my life 3.,Me too.,Me.
"The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",You're the lemon in your hair.,"Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face."
So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,Not at all.,"So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?"
"You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?","Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gn.",So you got the monkey attacked?
I can not believe.,"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.",That would be the right size.
You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,What?,I can not believe.
"If serious, this is too funny.",I would not?,You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.
"I, yes, but still.","Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.","If serious, this is too funny."
You know a long time. He told the truth?,But I can not lie on national TV.,"I, yes, but still."
I still say that it happened.,I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,"Ted, do not do that..."
"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.","Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",I still say that it happened.
"False! They like to discover that they lied. Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth. Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!","It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.","Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body."
"No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",You mean what you done to him.,"False! They like to discover that they lied. Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth. Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!"
"Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.","No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",You mean what you done to him.
"It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.","Yes, Neil?","Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait."
"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!","Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.","It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied."
You know it.,This is the belt of Planar 3?,"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!"
Yeah! I knew it.,You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gn? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.
"Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,Yeah! I knew it.
"Dude, what do you do?",It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,"I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it."
Now I want a weapon.,"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.","Dude, what do you do?"
You know if it was attacked?,No! I have not been mugged!,So Bobo goes.
It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,"Shit. Okay, put a microphone."
"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.","Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.
"Of course, Ted.",It's really happening?,I'll get it.
... seen.,... never...,... marriage...
"Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.,"Children, I swear, I remember the 12 minutes following. So I have no idea of the end of the song."
You're currently whining?,"Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.
"Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.","I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",You're currently whining?
"And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!","Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.","I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?"
"Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!",You marry when?,You marry when?
"Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.","Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!",Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.
Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional.  Shh. Leave it alone.,I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.,"Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence."
She cried to the song of Clint.,"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.",Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional.  Shh. Leave it alone.
"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?","I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.","What, are you saying that you bought the house?"
"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?","I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.","Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable."
The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.","Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that."
"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.","My God, you had to be completely stuffed.","Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave."
Put rockets in...,Children? Why...,"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened."
Gamin.,Bourre.,Bourre.
"You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.","Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!",Gamin.
"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Are you crying?,It's not me who cried during the song Clint.
I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,Not as much as me.,"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?"
"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",500? No worries.,I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.
"Wait, you're...","Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",500? No worries.
"Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?","Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.",Hmm.
"It was Robin! What! Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.","But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.","Not so fast.  was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease."
Of course.,"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?","It was Robin! What! Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know."
Shit.,You're always a little too far.,"Boy, you've almost had us still."
I see a complaint.,"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",He said he had found a tramp?
Thank you. My God.,"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?","Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate."

She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know?","Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?"
Ohhh,Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.,You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?
Excuse me?,"Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?","Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously.  Okay, I'm better now."
Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.,Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.,Excuse me?
But I... Can I go smell her first?,20 bucks.,Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.
Fine.,No.,But I... Can I go smell her first?
What the hell are you doing?,Good.,How are you?
"Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",That girl she's talking to? I dated her.,What the hell are you doing?
"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.","Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?","Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt."
"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",Jealous?,"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous."
You lost it.,I have not lost it.,"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it."
"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.","I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",You lost it.
"Yeah, she definitely saw you.","Hi, Ted!","Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?"
"Okay, will do. And dibs.","Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",Can I see you for a minute... in private?
"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.","Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?","Okay, will do. And dibs."
"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",Why not?,"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that."
"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",That was really...,"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him."
"No. Lily, look.  You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.",Brief.,"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!"
"Robin, you do look super hot.","14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",Hi.
"Yeah, you do.","Oh, do I?","Robin, you do look super hot."
"Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",Her words exactly.,Say good-bye before you leave?
No. Good. That was pretty lame.,"She didn't see us high-six, did she?","Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!"
"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",No! Of course! Absolutely!,"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?"
I don't want to talk about it.,What's wrong?,"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo.

"All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,"Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?"
"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.","With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric sx temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.
Of course not. It's a two-day job.,You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up."
"You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",Unsubscribe.,Same.
"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.,How did he do that?
How dare you!,"Yeah, that's what your mom said.","Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box."
Bro!,James!,"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?"
Mom. Stop.,Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.,Mama.
Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,"Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?","And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?"
"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.","Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.

"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",That sounds plausible.,"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."
"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...","Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.","Hey. It's true. Tell him, James."
"Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.","Oh, my God!

Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,"Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?
Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,"No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.","Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?"
Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,I'm not lying to our kids.,"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein."
"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?","Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade.

"Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... Your son.",What's in it?,Mom addressed this and never sent it.
"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",Can you believe her?,"I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!"
"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.","Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",Stop!
"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.","This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",Not now.
Really rich?,"No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. Everyone?",Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.
"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",You ready for this?,Really rich?
"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",I thought you said that he... Stop.,"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop.

"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!","Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...","God, this must be so hard for Barney."
"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!","Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",Are you kidding?
"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.","I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.","Here, Ted. Capture the moment!"
"Dad, look how fast I can run!","She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",You said she looked like a movie star.
"Dad, you're not looking!",He's beautiful.,His name's Eli.
"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",Barney? I need to talk to you.,"Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart."
Are you sure?,"Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.","Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?"
"What'd Coach say, Ma?","I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible.","And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before."
Why didn't anyone come?,He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.,"What'd Coach say, Ma?"
"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.",Barney.,"Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party."
I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,But it's your father.,"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it."
Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?,"Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom.",I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.
"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?","But first, let's back up a few days.","Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is unfinished. Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever..."
"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.","Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.",I don't know. Got a burger coming.
Hi. Barney Stinson.,"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.","Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy."
Thank you for your time.,"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.",Hi. Barney Stinson.
Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,Thank you for your time.,"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman."
"Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.","Back already. How was flying solo? And by solo, I mean so low that you got shot down.",There. Deleted.
"Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that sx just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have sx with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her.","Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?","Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase."
"No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?","What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.","The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor."
"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?","Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.",It's my building.
"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?"
Of course not.,"I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?","Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be."
I need another drink.,"I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...
Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?","That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work..."
"Chrissy, I love your glasses.","Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?","I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney."
They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,Really?,"Chrissy, I love your glasses."
"Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",But Barney hasn't done...,The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.
"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks!  Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower."
"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",And the intense eye contact thing?,He did.
That is so true.,You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?
"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?","Barney, I gotta tell you something.",Okay. Your turn.
"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?"
"What? Ted, it's too late.","Okay, I'll do it!",I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!
"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,"What? Ted, it's too late."
Dude!,What?,"Okay, it's a move."
You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,You guys lied to me?,"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman."
We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!
236.,"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.
"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.","No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.","...before me fell for. Wow, respect."
"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",Why aren't you in class?,"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?"
I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.,I knew this day would come.,"Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job."
"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.",Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.,I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.
"Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",Aw... That's actually really sweet.,"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face."
"Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?","By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things.","Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things."
Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.,"Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.","Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?"
"The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.","Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.","A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three."
"You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.","Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.",Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?
"Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?",How?,"You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first."
"Oh, wow!","Oh, my God!","Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?"
Stay sad! I'll be back!,"All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! Doesn't matter how you get there!","Oh, wow!"
"Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.",Stay sad! I'll be back!,"All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! Doesn't matter how you get there!"

I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?,"So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?",See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be...
Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.,"Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?",Are you kidding me?
"Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.","Oh, well, this... This is something important.

"Robin, I had no idea.","Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me klled. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.","What, you really had something to talk about?"
"No, don't stop the car.",Stopping the car.,"No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car."
"Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.",Seriously stopping the car.,"Seriously, stop the car."
Don't... You...,Carrots and peas.,"Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here."
Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.,"Oh, God. Oh, bite me!","Meanwhile, one subway car over..."

Stop! Too slow. Switch.,He did smell incredible.,"And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me."
Who cares?,Where are Marshall and lily?,There it is.
No!,I won? I won!,Who cares?
How did that even happen?,I can't believe I won!,No!
No!,I won!,"As for how Robin beat me and Barney, to this day, your uncle Barney won't admit it... Who cares? But here's what I saw: I saw Barney notice Robin's face... And maybe realize something. Barney says he tripped, but it sure felt like he tackled me on purpose. And when Robin won, I could have sworn I saw him smile."
"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.",I know what you did back there.,"So I said, the cab, of course"
Smell me.,I'm not gonna... Not gonna...,"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me."
Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!,"I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.","Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term...

"Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.","Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said...",Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!
Sure. What's up?,"Barney, we have to talk.","Uh, no, thank you. Still got it."
"Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.",Sure. What's up?,"Barney, we have to talk."
"Not now, Trish!","Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.",Sure. What's up?
But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.,"Not now, Trish!","Excuse me, Mr. Stinson."
"Legendary! So, what's on your mind?",Dary.,But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.
You're kidding me.,Just don't!,"That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small pen1s..."
Snakes.,"I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?",You're kidding me.
"I don't recall saying snakes. Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.",Did you just say snakes?,Snakes.
You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.,New is always better?,"I don't recall saying snakes. Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better."
Everything.,Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.
Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.,"So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",Everything.
"Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.","And when you're at a gns n' Roses concert, you're like, Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy?",Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.
"A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!","Your call, buddy.",Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin.
How can you speak of such things?,Max has a small pen1s.,Told him what?
How can you speak of such things?,"Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...","Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation..."
I do not do that.,"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, Boobs? Not the complete sentence, Does she have big boobs? Which also would not be great. Just: Boobs?",How can you speak of such things?
Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,My friend Lori from work...,I do not do that.
"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened."
"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me."
Boobs?,What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,Duh. Of course there's a girl.
Whose dream?,She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,"Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices..."
"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.","That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a trnny before, but it's still sweet.","Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait."
And you said...?,Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?,Anything.
"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",Where do I sign?,And you said...?
"And what did this Zoey say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?"
This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,What? I panicked!,I'm a veterinarian.
Asian girls love them some Jews.,Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies!  ... Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel!  ...   Look, she's really hot, okay?"
"No. Technically, they were eggs.","The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",And you're welcome.
I don't recall saying eggs.,Did you just say eggs?,"No. Technically, they were eggs."
"Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!","Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.","Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so..."
Momentary grudging respect.,"Solid C-cup, perky bounce.","Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!"
"Ted, that is never gonna happen.","Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",Momentary grudging respect.
Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,How the hell could you do that?,"She was really hot, okay?"
"I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.","The billboard, Barney.",Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.
"Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,"I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal."
Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,"Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!","Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!"

So you're back in?,You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,"You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it."
You want the long version or the short version?,"You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?",Mmm...  I thought she was charming.
Short version. Who's your daddy?,Short version.,You want the long version or the short version?
Challenge accepted.,"Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.",Wow. That is disgusting.
"I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.",No.,Challenge accepted.
"Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.","Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.","Gentlemen, gentlemen. Coming up on the main stage, give it up for Esther!"
That was my card!,Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!,"Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance."
"Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie.  Who's your daddy?","Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.","I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God."
I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,"Yeah, I slept.",Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?
Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!,I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,"Yeah, I slept."
"I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.","Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away, give it up for Marshall's daughter!",This is ridiculous.
I'm sorry.,"No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.","Yeah, we don't care about this..."
Challenge accept...,"Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.",I'm sorry.
Hey.,Hey.,"Okay, A  He was a doll; B  He was possessed by an adult serial killer; and C  How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?"
"No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.","Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?",Hey.
"Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say Who's your daddy? to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.","That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.","No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all."
": Uh-oh, I'm in twubble.",Someone naughty left his toys on the floor and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.,"Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?"
"Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go.",You did it? How?,": Uh-oh, I'm in twubble."
No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.,"Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some?","Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go."
"Challenge completed!  Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.",Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy?,No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.
"Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam.","It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.",Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.
I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.,"Oh, no, thank you. I brew my own. At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic.","Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer?"
Looks like that bee got busy.,"Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.","Oh, we were big fans of New York's annual Halloween parade. I don't mean the one that takes place Halloween night in the Village. I mean the one that takes place the morning of November 1st, the Annual Post Halloween Walk of Shame Parade."
That's a line.,"Come on, Marshall.","Oh, looks like Pocahontas has a couple of wounded knees."
Does it get any better than this?,We get it.,"No, it's because of the..."
There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.,Crap.,"Uh, yes.  Yes, it does."
Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.,My co-anchor's a woman.,Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.
I care about our precious Earth.,"What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care.","No, GNB was not popular. That's why every year they produced a feel-good video to improve the bank's image."
All you have to do is say I care about making dreams come true.,"Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.","I care about high-yield offshore investments. And so does Tugboat here. Isn't that right, Tugboat?"
Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.,"First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.",All you have to do is say I care about making dreams come true.
I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.,"Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.",That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!
"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.","Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.","Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent."
"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",That's...exactly what happened.,"Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry."
"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy mrderd him.","Hey, guys.","Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side."
"Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. We care about making dreams come true, in three, two...","Oh, we'll see about that.","Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever."
"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,Now am I fired?
"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.","Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.","I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee."
"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life."
Yep. That's a wrap.,I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?,"Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because..."
"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a fat cat. Me and my fat-cat friends. We're not fat cats.,"In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building: The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day."
"Ah, bully!","Impeccable, old bean. To industry!","Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?"
"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",Ooh.,"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope."
"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, Don't touch anything. To a kid. That's like someone telling us Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.","Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?","Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale."
"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",Not bad.,Ooh.
It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?,"Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.","So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale.

Niled it.,"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.","Okay, that's also a made-up word."

Thank you.,"No. But I could, uh, check the files.","Oh, yeah, that story is legend...  Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?"
"Who's the master, Leroy?","July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale.

Thank you.,"Oh, you're wearing a flower.","But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere."
I know. Isn't it?,"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",Thank you.
"Exactly. Science. There is an 83 correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The everyday boutonniere by Stinson.",Why does Barney do anything ever?,Why are you wearing that?
"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for bootie is near? True story. Une histoire vraie.",Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.,"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car."
"Woman, you best check yourself.",Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid,"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for bootie is near? True story. Une histoire vraie."
Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!,"Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...","Woman, you best check yourself."

The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,Of course. Robin hates kids.,Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.
Two dudes on the couch together watching prn? That's kind of weird.,Just watch it without me.,We've been waiting all day!
We...,"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.

No arguments here.,"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!","Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?"
"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, You are the weakest link. Goodbye. Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us.

Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,It's not awesome!
"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain."
No. I c... Because... Step on it.,"But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?","And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz."
But he's The Blitz.,Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang Twist and Shout!,"Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!"
"Oh, God, no!",Blitz...,No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.
Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. : I'm scared.,"Barney, could you get me some more ice?","No, I meant the wang."
Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.,Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. : I'm scared.
What happened?,"Okay, I got to test this.",Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.
"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!","Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",You missed it!
"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. 100! No-- 10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.,"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!"
"That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha!  Burn on her.","Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?","Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. Yes, enemies can become friends. Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'"

"Thank you, God!","Oh, hold the door!","Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket."
"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",Okay. That man is terrifying.,"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?"
"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?","Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy.  But the top half of his face...wants to mrder you! Cheerful. Wants to mrder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to mrder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",Okay.
And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,Holding the towel.,Running the water.
Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...","All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey."
Lubricant is public property.,And the most important rule of all...,"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going."
"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",Oh! Sweet. No candles.,"Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us."
"Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",Barney.,"That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?"
"No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!","Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.","Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing."

"So, who's the eye broccoli?","Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.
"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.","Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.","So, who's the eye broccoli?"
"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs."
"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",I'm sorry. Myth?,"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?"
D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...","It was 300 years ago.

Let's say yes.,Did we bet on this?,D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.
"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!","Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.","Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about."
Nah. Watch out!,Want to hang?,"Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney."
"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?","Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.","If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!"
"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",I asked Barney the same thing.,"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?"
"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",Death?,"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome."
"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?","Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.","Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence."
"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.","Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.","Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?"
"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?","Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",That was it! I remember now!
"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",Oh... You're a jerk.,"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"
Breast-feeding. Hot.,What's that?,"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act."

"I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.",Barney. W- What number is this?,"Hey, Marshall."
"Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.","Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.","I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone."
"That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.",Uh... Robin's version was...,Honey.
Coaster.,Straw.,"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah..."
"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.","Okay, time to go home.",Coaster.
Who's your daddy?,"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.","Okay, time to go home."
"Sure, I'll just summarize it.","Okay, can we skip this part, please?",Who's your daddy?
"Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.","Okay, that's been going on a while.","Sure, I'll just summarize it."
"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.","Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.","Okay, that's been going on a while."
"Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...",Thanks.,"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts."
"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize...","Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?","Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so..."
She hugged me. What was that all about?,"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize...","Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?"
Who's your daddy?,"Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.","Listen, um, about Barney..."
I don't know.,Oh... Who's your daddy?,Who's your daddy?
So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.,I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.,I don't know.
"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.","Oh, honey.",So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.
"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.","Oh, honey.","I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me."
Four. Four Nobel Prizes.,"Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.","I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son."
Only three.,"Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?",Four. Four Nobel Prizes.
"You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.","My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.",I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.
Total booty-call.,Oh. Translation: booty-call.,"Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies."
"Wow, you sound really lonely.",Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.,"If it bleeds, we can kll it."
"Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.","I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...","Wow, you sound really lonely."
"It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",That's not a thing.,"Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day."
"Wait, there's more.",That's actually true.,"It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death."
"And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.",This won't be.,"Wait, there's more."
"Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13.

Lying trolls.,...who could care less about Valentine's Day.,Trolls.
"You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?",I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,And none was taken until just then.
"We said you were going to have sx. We didn't say, Bring a carry-on.",You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.,You brought an overnight bag?

It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens."

My elbow slipped!,"Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?","Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late."

Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,Yeah.,Quick question.
Sure.,"Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?",Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?

What's that?,Although there is one difference between you and me.,The worst.
"All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.","Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",I know.
"Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.","What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney.

"I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.","Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.",I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.
"What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!","Well, I think I'm heading out, too.","I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news."
What are you talking about?,Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,"It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye."
"No, I don't. She's gross.","Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",What are you talking about?
Whatever you say.,Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,"No, I don't. She's gross."

Oh!,"And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.","Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here."
I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.","What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years."
You want to grab a drink right now?,"Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.",Not according to her.
Absolutely.,"No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.",You want to grab a drink right now?

What?,Nora met a guy. What?!,"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?"

You really are smitten.","Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver."
"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan.

"All right, Robin, give it to me.",I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings."
"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?","Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, Yeah, Barney, go get her! But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.","All right, Robin, give it to me."
A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,"It's a five, idiot.","The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?"

Ah. Thank you.,"That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.","Come on, let's get you sorted out."
"Good night, Mommy.","Good night, Barney.",Ah. Thank you.
No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.,"Wow, she nursed you back to health?","Good night, Mommy."
"Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",Should have just let you get a dog.,"Actually, I met him in the park."
No.,"Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?","Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist."

"Well, now it doesn't.",Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.,"Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight."
"Go on, Doctor.","Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.","And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results."
"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?,"Go on, Doctor."
"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.","This might be a little forward, but do you have a bmb strapped to your chest?","Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner."

"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?","Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.",Thanks.
"That's exactly what I want, too.",You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!,"I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want.

And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that."

"I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.","Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.",And that explains your 14-second cardiac arrest.
"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.","Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.","I'm not going to let you do this.

"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?","Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.","Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it."
Marshall?,"Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.","Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?"
The calzone?,You got nothing on me.,Marshall?
Robin.,Checkmate.,The calzone?
The Mr. T dream...,"Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...",Robin.
Ted?,I'm lost.,The Mr. T dream...
The ballet class.,Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.,Ted?
The 'N Sync concert.,I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.,The ballet class.
"Okay, Ted. The thermos.","1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?",The 'N Sync concert.
I do! So be cool!,I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.,"Okay, Ted. The thermos."
Thermos.,Once?,"Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once."
"I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.",This was a big deal for Barney.,"It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?"
Not even if her mom's hot.,Not even if she's hot?,"I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents."
I'd love to meet your parents.,Not even if her mom's hot.,Not even if she's hot?
"No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!",Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.,"It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?"
"Yeah, me, too.",Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.,Scooby got out!
"I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.",Do you want to come upstairs?,"Yeah, me, too."
Can you believe...,"I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.",Do you want to come upstairs?
"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.
I was on the spot. This is your fault.,Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!,"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you."
"Yeah, with the whole I want to get married thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",My fault?,I was on the spot. This is your fault.
"Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?","Hey, have you seen Scooby?",Who's Scooby?
"Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.",Day's not over.,"And that explains 12:51 a.m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you."
"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...","No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.","Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down."
Last night? 8:30.,What time was your dinner reservation?,"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But..."
I lied.,"Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.",What did his heart do at 8:30? It... literally skipped a beat.
"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.",Barney.,I lied.
"So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.",I'm confused.,"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry."
"Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?","Mom, Dad... this is Barney.","So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you."
"Ted. This is your seduction lounge. sx swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...","Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.","Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"
"Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second."
"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.","Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?","Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness."
"Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",You call the super for a screwdriver?,"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks."
"Well, here's our screwdriver now.  Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.","Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.","Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again."
Dad?,"Barney, I... I got your letter.","Well, here's our screwdriver now.  Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself."
Where do I begin?,"Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",I still think about him in the shower.
Yeah. I think I need a drink.,"So, I'm not sure how to start this.",Where do I begin?
"Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",Nice order. Up top.,"Glen McKenna, neat."
"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.","Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?","Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute."
Make a muscle.,"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.","Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?"
Ah!,There you go.,Make a muscle.
"Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",Ah!,There you go.
"Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?","Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",Ah!
You're funny. My dad's funny.,"Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.","Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?"
"So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",You're funny. My dad's funny.,"Not anymore.

Do you... get laid a lot?,"You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",Why'd you wait so long to contact me?
"Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",Big-time. Observe.,Do you... get laid a lot?
You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,"Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.","Oh, my God, that took you five seconds."
"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,"Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks."
"Oh, that's cool.",So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream."
This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg.,"Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?","Oh, that's cool."
What do you mean?,"Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg.
"First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.","Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.","Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear."
I'm not sure how to start this.,That's not what happened.,"What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together."
I think I need a drink.,Yeah.,I'm not sure how to start this.
"Glen McKenna, neat.","Me, too.",I think I need a drink.
"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?","Milk, skim.","Glen McKenna, neat."
Wow.,"I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.","Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?"
"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?","I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.",Wow.
"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.","No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right","Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?"
"Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.","Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.","Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass."
"Yes, yes, yes.","The drugs, the alcohol, the women...","Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff."
Out of control.,I was out of control.,"Yes, yes, yes."
You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,"So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.",Out of control.
Big-time.,"What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.","I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so..."
"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the Father Knows Breast, there's the Bush Dynasty, the Lick Father, Lick Son.","Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",Big-time.
Why?,"Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.","Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the Father Knows Breast, there's the Bush Dynasty, the Lick Father, Lick Son."
"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.","I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.",Why?
What?,We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,"I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son."
"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",You're having dinner with him tonight.,What?
"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",Are you sure it's not more than that?,"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that."
"Fine, I'll go.","No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.","Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again."
"Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.",Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.,And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.
"Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.","Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.","Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat."
"It ages well, that's the thing.","Hey, Lily,  Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys.  ...  The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",I first noticed it at the bar.
I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,"J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.","Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night."
"J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.","Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.","Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid."
"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?","So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.","Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person.  Right? What?"
"Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",I'm 11.,"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?"
"Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",I got a paper route.,"Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J."
"Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?",J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.,It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers.
"Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",Fourth period?,"Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?"
Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?,"Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.",Jerry!
Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.,J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.,Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?
This is mine.,"Barney, what is going on?","No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this."
"J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",I don't understand.,This is mine.
"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.","Please, just come down and talk to me.","J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me."
"Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",Why does that make you so mad?,"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad."
"Oh, screwed up doesn't even begin to describe...","Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...","Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!"
Can you help me with this?,"I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.","Oh, screwed up doesn't even begin to describe..."
Bye.,"Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.",Can you help me with this?
"I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?,Bye.
"You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?","Yeah, buddy.","I'm fine. Hey, Ted."
"No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.","Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.","You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?"
"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.","But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.",That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait!
Quit GNB?! Why?,I have to quit.,"Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything."
"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.","I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",Quit GNB?! Why?
"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.","Baby, you have my full support.","Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup?

"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",I don't think you know what Spain is.,"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids."
Where? I want his autograph!,It's dinero.,"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira."
"Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having sx with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. : He was a good boy.,The guy who was basically a dog?
"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!","You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.","The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer."
It starts with an... L?,I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,"You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall."
And I said my name was...?,It rhymes with your name.,... don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.
"It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.","Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play Who's Hot and Who's Scott?","Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?"
I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",We take turns! Sometimes.
"What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",Hershel?,I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.
There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,"Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.","What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws."
Just come back to GNB already!,"Barney, I'm not playing...",There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?
That's how I'm gonna use mine.,"Thanks, baby.  Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.","Baby, you have my full support."
"Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,That's how I'm gonna use mine.
"Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. Barney, we have to talk about your father. Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil. Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute. I don't need this!","Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?","Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better."
"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?","Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go.","Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her..."
"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.","Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.","Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB.

How long have you been there?,"Oh, my God!","Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time."
"Oh, no, I'm fine.","Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",You don't remember?
"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?","Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?","Oh, no, I'm fine."
"Right. So, um... Chinese?",Yeah.,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?"
There's nothing to talk about.,"My bag? Oh, no. I got it.","Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this."
"I don't want to talk about it, okay?","You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",There's nothing to talk about.
Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,Why not?,"I don't want to talk about it, okay?"
That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... : ticking.",Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.
Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?
It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,Huh?,Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.
"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,Huh?
"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...","Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.","Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life."
"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?","I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub.

And then...","Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there."
"Thank you, Marshall.  Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?","We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",You're too young. This isn't fair.
Eat this meatball sub.,"Yes, of course, of course... anything.","Thank you, Marshall.  Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?"
I don't have much time!,Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,Eat this meatball sub.
"I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up 30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!","Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",I don't have much time!
What? That's... What is that word you taught me? Bull something?,"Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz kll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.","Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas."
But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,"But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.",What? That's... What is that word you taught me? Bull something?
A drunk audience.,"Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?",But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.
Bye.,This time it was Barney who did the walking.,I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.
"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.","And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...",Bye.
My dad!,Mmm. Your dad?,"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess."
Barney Stinson.,My dad!,Mmm. Your dad?
"Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.","Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?",Barney Stinson.
You do not know how right you are.,"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... Crazy Jerry? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?","Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years."
Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,You do not know how right you are.,"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... Crazy Jerry? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?"
"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.","You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.
"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?","Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.","I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues."
"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.","Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out.

Do any of you know George Clooney?","Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs."
No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,That's why you brought these guys.,"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight."
Yeah.,Improvements?!,No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.
"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.","Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",Yeah.
"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",Gross!,Whoo-hoo!
"Ted, card.","Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, Man is least himself when he talks...","Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about."
"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",Ah. You're right... No quoting Oscar Wilde.,"Ted, card."
"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.","Aw, man! Why?","Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted."
And... hence new identities.,How good was that movie?,"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?"
"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",And so Barney's dad finally showed up.,And... hence new identities.
"Lily, his wife.","Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.","Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer."
"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend."
"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...","So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?","Two, three, four!"
"Oh, no.","Um, those places shut down a long time ago.","Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong..."
"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?","Where's where Was was, isn't it?",Where's Where?
"Guys, focus.",That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?
"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",I thought Focus was closed.,Not Where. Focus.
"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.","Guys, shut up.",Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.
"It's hopeless, isn't it?","For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lam.",Okay is Lame! Gay bar.
I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,"It's hopeless, isn't it?"
"Man, isn't this place great?",You owe me one.,Yeah.
"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,"Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!"
Let's do shots.,What?,I brought French cooking to America!
No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? Never stop partying.,"Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.",Let's do shots.
"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?",I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.,No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? Never stop partying.
"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.",But I want to hang out with you.,"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?"
Can you believe it? This is awesome!,"Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!",Oh...
I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,"Barney, how is that awesome?",Can you believe it? This is awesome!
"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",So our usual wager. Deal.,"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have sx in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have sx in the bathroom."
"No, of course not. I... I just...","Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?","Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?"
"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!","Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!","No, of course not. I... I just..."
": Hey, hey! There we go!","You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!","After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy."
Oh...!,"Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!",": Hey, hey! There we go!"
"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...","Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.",I just puked on the hood of that... police car!
What?,"Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!","It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special..."
Whoa!,Here you go.,"I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise."
But all those crazy things you did.,"Bottoms up, amigo!",Whoa!
A drunk audience.,Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?,But all those crazy things you did.
"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!","You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!",A drunk audience.
Oh...!,Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!,"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!"
What just happened?,Oh...!,Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!
"Well, why do all those things?",I... I just puked on the hood of that... ...police car.,What just happened?
You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,"I figured if I showed you what... never stop partying really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well.","Well, why do all those things?"
"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.",I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.,You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!
"Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too.  Abracadabra!",Perhaps.,"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs."
We need someplace to hide.,"Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?","I, uh... Oh."
"No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.",Where?,We need someplace to hide.
Step on it! Jerry...,"Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.","No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs."
"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.",Do not step on it.,Step on it! Jerry...
This is no time for laws!,The laws are there to protect...,"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip."
I am not going to buckle up!,"Buckle up, Barney.",This is no time for laws!
How did you do it?,And her fianc? The guy's like a two.,It wasn't the end of that. More on that later
"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",Do what?,How did you do it?
"Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...",You're drifting.,"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs..."
"When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.","No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.","Hey, I'm trying to open up to you..."
So how do you do it?,"Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.","When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken."
Maybe I've met her already.,A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.,So how do you do it?
Maybe some other time.,"And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.",Maybe I've met her already.
I'm going fishing with my dad.,"Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.",Maybe some other time.
This... sucks.,I'm going fishing with my dad.,"Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years."
"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to Hot For Teacher. Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.","If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.","And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey."

"Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.","Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",You know it.
"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?","Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?","So, they found water on Mars. What?"
I mean this is really like...,That was on purpose!,"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?"
No. I' was... I was...,Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!,"A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed."
Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.,This went on for days.,No. I' was... I was...

Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?"
"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?

"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...","See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation.

"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",Nailed it.,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?"
I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee.

"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.","No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog.

I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,"Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say under the weather, or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things."
"I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",I bet it's her tushie.,I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.
"I got you this job, so I... Say what?","Yeah, fine, okay.","I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!"
You...,Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run.,"I got you this job, so I... Say what?"
Who's that from?,Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. See you in an hour.,"Hello?... Yes, it is.  Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby."
Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,Who's that from?
"No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.","After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.
"Ted, I only have one rule.",Bro.,"Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?"
We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,"I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie?"
"Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.","Okay, Zoey wrote, Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.",We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?
You weren't listening either?,"Aw, that's sweet.",Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection...
Lily!,"I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",You weren't listening either?
That's the intersection.,Got it. Ted's at...  Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us..."
Way ahead of ya.,That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,That's the intersection.
I know. They're a total train wreck.,I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,"Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train."
"Yeah, almost as bad as us.",Worst couple ever.,Unmitigated disaster.
"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.","We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.","Yeah, almost as bad as us."
"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra."
What do you mean?,I guess I get it.,"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?"
"Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?","Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",What do you mean?
Maybe this isn't the intersection.,"Okay, where the hell are they?","Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open."
She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,"Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?",Wait. Where'd you get that?
"Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.","Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?
But... it's a mistake.,"Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.","I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!"
He is.,"Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors?",And Marshall slept...all night.
Yeah. You earned it.,You sure?,He is.
Always.,"Hey, new is always better, right?",All clear!
"It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please?  Norah.",I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.,...one!
How you been?,Hi.,"It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please?  Norah."
"Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.",Fine.,How you been?
"I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.",I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.,"Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book."
Challenge accepted.,"It's never too late, Barney.","I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses."
What do you think of this tie?,"Geez, what now?  I heard the groom needed me.",Best man? You're being summoned.
What do you think of this tie?,What do you think of this tie?,"Geez, what now?  I heard the groom needed me."
This one is better?,"Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?",What do you think of this tie?
"I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?","The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.",This one is better?
I do not really talk about the tie.,"Yeah, sure.","I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?"
I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?,"Yeah, I realized that Barney.",I do not really talk about the tie.
That of Punchy.,Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.,I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?
"Yeah, no problem, of course.",Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?,Punchy asked me to be his witness.
Woow.,Ok,"Yeah, no problem, of course."
"Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland.","Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.",Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?
"Here's your speech. In single file, girls. No big.",This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.,"Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland."
"Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. In single file, girls.",This is ridiculous.,"Here's your speech. In single file, girls. No big."
I'll call you.,"Children, you remember Nora. But the other day...","Barney, he did not need your advice. You never called Nora."
I did not call.,Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?,"It's never too late, Barney."
"I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings.","Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.","Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?"
"Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.",So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.,You're pregnant! Come here!
What?,You're going to try to make you anybody here?,"Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James."
"It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83...","My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.",What?

"Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that.","Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.",Wait. You encourage me to cry at your own wedding?
"It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?",Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?,"It does not make sense. It's chemistry. Listen, I always them a sixth sense for these things. And now that I'm pregnant... deep in me in my uterus, I see things more clearly. You and Barney have that kind of chemistry that is still there."
"I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.","Well. Barney, just to make things clear...","Because in the depths of himself, even if he does not know yet, Barney wants to be with you. And if it does not happen, he deserves to know."
"Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.",Barney... I...,"I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes."
"I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.","Wait, you said you'd never recalled.","Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me."

"I chose the right tie, huh?","No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?",And that's how Marshall has destroyed the marriage of Punchy. But we did not care. It would be a sixth member in our family.
"You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?",This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.,"You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck."
