213," OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. "," Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?"
214," Yeah, the Barnacle.", Really? That's the nickname now?
215, That's it. Barnacle out. , The Barnacle.

218, What's with the face?," Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression."
219, So go to the bathroom.," It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee."
220," So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof."," No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin."
221," Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there."," Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there."
222, Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.," Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven."
223, I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink., You wouldn't believe.
224, I'm also a horny devil.  Yeah., You certainly are a charming devil.
225, OK Victoria's Secret party right now., Brain freeze.
226," Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.", Nope.
227, Oy., She might.
228, Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!," Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope."
229," No, see ya.  Ow.",  See ya.
230," You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check."," Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't..."
231," Yes, it is.", Unbelievable.
232," What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot", Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.
233," Yeah, well, you did, thanks.", I cannot believe I gave you my number
234," Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you."," Well, give it back."
235, But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah., But I'm never gonna go out with you.
236," Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.", Nice.
237, Fine. Fine. , I'm staying.
238, I'm flippering you off., What are you doing?
239," What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold."," I know, I'm still shaking."
240, Marshall ran away from a cockroach.," But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae"
241," Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man."," It, it was a mouse."
242, Was that chick at the end really a client?," Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky..."
243, We're signing up., Yes.
244," Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.", What?
245, Come on., Oh my God.
246," Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.", Come on.
247, My boat is sinking., What?
248," Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. ", Your boat is sinking. That was good.
249," Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x."," All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step."
250," That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.", You deserve more.
251," It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?"," Oh, of course you can. That is so..."
252, What?, Get out.
253," Oh my God, people do that."," I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again."
254, What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?, You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?
255," OK, Ted, let's go.", That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.
256," Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that."," OK, it's back and this time we got a good look."
257, So did you get a good look at it?," Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over."
258, Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?, It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...
259," Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when", Did you just use my name as a verb?
260," Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman."," My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch."
261, You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.," OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin."
262," Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game."," Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman."
263, The doctor will see you now.," Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day."
264,  Happy ending.," Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so."
265," All right, see you later. Happy hunting."," Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot."
266," Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles."," Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse."
267," No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed."," Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything."
268," Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged", And why is that girl checking you out?
269," So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?"," Yeah, so?"
270," You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.", Dammit Past Ted
271," Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.", One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.
272, Sort of on a date with her.," Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?"
273," I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.", What?
274," Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck."," Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney."
275," Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy."," Ooh, can I do it?"
276," Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?"," Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy."
277," An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy."," Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff."
278, Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?," An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy."
279," Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there."," Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate."
280, See you guys later.," Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there."
281," Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.", They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.
282," Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike."," One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication."
283," You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big."," Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?"
284, Bigger.," What, like buy a new sofa?"
285," Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.", Bigger.
286," Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now."," A lemon law, like for cars."
287, Hi Katie. Barney.," Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now."
288," Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history."," Hi, it's good to finally meet you."
289," No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!", You're a jerk.
290," No, wrong, lemon law is awesome."," For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society."
291," OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy."," It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great."
292, You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?," OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy."
293," Bad move, Scherbatsky."," Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate."
294," Hi, have you met Robin?"," Bad move, Scherbatsky."
295,"  Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.", Hello.
296," 4:56, 4:57, 4:58.", Leave me alone.
297, Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital., We're only just getting to know each other.
298," So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.", They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.
299," What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie."," So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie."
300," Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O."," What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie."
301," It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law."," Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you."
302, And to the lemon law., Here here. Cheers
303, Self-clink., And to the lemon law.
304," The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.", Not how much? What.
305," Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal."," No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition."
306," I'm sorry, Native American."," Oh, Barney."
307, Canceling out Barney.," Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good."
308," Excuse me, guys. Coming through."," I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York."
309," Well, hi guys.", Barney?
310," Oh, just the Lord's work.", What are you doing here?
311," Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.", But you're Satan.
312, I'm on it.," Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?"
313," That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall."," Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer"
314," Kendall, they're cool."," Come on, we just wanna help out."
315," OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles."," Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you."
316," Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner."," Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!"
317,"  You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude."," Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?"
318," So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.", Lily!
319," Yeah, Right. Thanks."," Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?"
320," Yeah, what's up?", Barney.
321," Yeah, so.", You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.
322, That's my private personal business!," All right, let me see that."
323, That's my private personal business., Court-mandated community service.
324, I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church., That's my private personal business.
325, I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk., You peed on a church?
326," OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW."," Now, all's right with the world again."
327, When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?," OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW."
328, I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip., Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.
329, Volunteer of the year!, I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.
330," Ted, I'm glad you asked."," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it."
331, Right? I told you so., Surprisingly good.
332," OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance."," You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer."
333, I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment., Are you joking?
334," Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance."," No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine."
335," No, no.", I hope not.
336, That's ridiculous.," OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?"
337, You gonna put out?," $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger."
338, What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills., You gonna put out?
339, What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.," OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for..."
340, Daddy's home.," Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?"
341, Yeah., Daddy's home?
342," Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid."," You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney."
343,"  Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?"," Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that..."
344," Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.", That worked. I hate the world.
345, Totally., Doo-doo.
346, Oh yes it can.," So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped."
347," Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.", Interesting
348, Oh no. I want you to do five shots.," So, what? You want me to do a shot."
349," No, don't think. Do."," Barney, I think you've officially..."
350," I love it, I love it, I love it.", Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.
351, No....Dammit., Oh. 
352," No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober."," Oh, bad idea."
353," Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.", You'll get this back at the end of class.
354, Hello.," That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened."
355, The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling., Why are you sleeping in our tub?
356," Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank."," Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?"
357," Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.", How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.
358," Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.", I'm back baby doll!
359," All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?"," Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now."
360," Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.", I think....
361, Have you met Ted?, Bring it.
362, You're calling Robin., Have you met Ted?
363," Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.", I'm calling Robin.
364," If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.", Oh yeah? What you gonna do?
365," Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.", You set me on fire.
366, Who is she?, And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?
367, Nice., I have no idea.
368," No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here.", You really don't know who that is?
369," Sleep it off, bra."," Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer."
370," Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.", Did you guys?
371," Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again."," Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it..."
372, Daddy's home., Wake her up and say what?
373, Daddy's home.," I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see."
374," OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.", Or the one after that.
375, Ladies.," OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy."
376, Robin., Hey guys.
377, Top of the morning., Hi Robin.
378, I'm good., I love to snack.
379, Question?," Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five."
380," But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants."," Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants."
381," People often ask me ""Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"""," Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight..."
382," And the answer is right here... my own, personal ""get psyched"" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.", By who? Who asks you that?
383, Let's do this!," Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot."
384," Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome."," Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?"
385," Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it."," Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story."
386, Party number one!, Party number one!
387, Natalya.," So, Barney, who's your new friend?"
388, She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?," So, where are you from, Natalya?"
389, Isn't she awesome?," Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?"
390," It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?"," Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking."
391," Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya.", Party number three. Yeah.
392, What?!," Barney, none of us really liked her."
393," Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?", Sorry.
394, What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.," Oh, dude, not now!"
395, My finger slipped., Maybe I should just go home.
396," We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?"," Oh, yes. Ted, you rock."
397," No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit."," Yeah, we like hot dogs."
398," Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool."," Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!"
399," Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?", Wow. You're friendly.
400," Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it."," This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise."
401, Jan... Aah!," Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here."
402," But when we said, ""Hey, Moby,"" you said, ""Yeah.""", No.
403," No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby.", You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.
404, Why did we think that guy was Moby?," Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe."
405, That's Marshall's phone. Hello.," I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby."
406," Hey, sexy."," Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through."
407, He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.," Barney, where's Marshall?"
408, Party number three., What? Where?
409, Moby?! She's upstairs.," Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!"
410," Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.", Who was that guy?!
411," Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my ""Get Psyched"" mix!"," No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong."
412," Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.", I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.
413, I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?," Is this just 'cause you lost your ""Get Psyched"" mix?"
414," The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am."," Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal."
415," Give it a rest, Ted.", Marshall!
416," Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.", Give what a rest?
417," Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist."," Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes."
418, Come on! Oh! Oh!," Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on."
419," Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?", Natalya?
420, Cheers. Well said.," Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here."
421," Here, you need a mint."," I super love you, okay?"
422," Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.", Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?
423," You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date."," Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah."
424," Ted, it's a simile."," Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?"
425," Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you."," Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed."
426," What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.", I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck
427, What?," Ah, here we go."
428, What up?, A little girl?
429," Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years."," Right. But I'm the bride, so I win."
430," Invigorating, thanks."," Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?"
431," But to be fair, she's also hot."," I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy."
432," Yeah, right."," I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did."
433," Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?", I did.
434," Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move..."," Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech."
435," A little Barney. And you know what he said?  ""Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.""", A little Barney.
436," Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.", Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.
437," Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries."," Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up."
438," Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?", You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.
439,  They all drink vodka cranberries.," Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?"
440," So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",  They all drink vodka cranberries.
441," No, but I do have a hug."," You got $400,000?"
442,  Thank you.," No, but I do have a hug."
443," That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please."," You know I don't have $400,000, right?"
444," Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."," That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please."
445," Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle."," Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me."
446, Oww," Oh, hell no."
447," Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each."," Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes."
448," All right, all right."," Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each."
449," Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen."," Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break."
450, Those two eight's right over there. Yeah., What's a sixteen?
451," Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids."," Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy."
452, Being single's the best., I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.
453, Answer to no one., Stay out as late as you want.
454, Never having to go to a farmer's market., The whole world full of endless possibilities.
455," OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...", Never having to go to a farmer's market.
456," Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is."""," Wow, the Peace Corps?"
457," Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that."," Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do."
458," Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted."," Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded..."
459," This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?", Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?
460, Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste., Barney.
461, You know I did.," Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?"
462, You know I won't., Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.
463," Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.", Why not?
464," Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night."," Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause."
465, Really? Ted: Yeah.," OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing."
466, But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing., Really? Ted: Yeah.
467, Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial., I'm ready to be proven wrong.
468,"  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.", Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.
469,  What kind of shoes...,"  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on."
470,"  Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",  What kind of shoes...
471, Oh come on., Actually.
472,  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them., Whoa. There she goes.
473," Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.
474," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.", I have no idea.
475, I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x."
476," Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!", Going. Getting.
477, Oh come on!, Yes! No.
478," Ted, you still with us?"," Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake."
479," The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot."," And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be..."
480," Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.", Burn!
481, Really?," Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me."
482," Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow."""," Good, cause this thing's empty."
483, It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.," Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident."
484, You can't just... Wow!, Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?
485," Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?", Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.
486, You suited up!," Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss."
487, Emilio? The woman will have...," Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right."
488," Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide."""," I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks."
489, Father issues. Hot.," My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention."
490," Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.", I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.
491, What up! Freeze frame high five!," Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant."
492, Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still..., So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?
493, There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it., What?
494," Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months."," Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!"
495," Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?"," Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!"
496, No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.," Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it."
497," Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.", But I...
498, Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?, See you on the other side.
499, All right., Yeah.
500, Neither have I. Of course I cheat., Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.
501, Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.," Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L."
502," Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt."," Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox."
503," Oh, my mistake. Or is it?", That's a woman.
504, Right., Let's just focus on your target.
505, Hey., You always do.
506, Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else., Hey.
507," Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.", What happened?
508, Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores., But why?
509, Hit!," Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?"
510," Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake."," I love you, Lily."
511, Hard-core? That's the only way I play. ," Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys."
512," I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?", I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?
513," Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.", No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.
514," You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?", What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.
515, Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship., No.
516," But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well."," Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second..."
517, I checked with Ted.," Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?"
518," Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?", I checked with Ted.
519, Totally gave us his blessing., Sure. Good luck with that.
520, Really., Really?
521, Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh..., So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?
522, You like Ted., What?
523, You like Ted. Wow. This is huge., I didn't say I liked Ted.
524," Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?"," Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for..."
525, No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.," You're not gonna tell him, are you?"
526, Miss., A-7.
527," Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return."," Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the..."
528," So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?"," Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains."
529," Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon."," Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?"
530, Where's the tape?," Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give..."
531," Cool, okay. You know, whenever.", Fine. I'll go get it.
532," Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me."," Oh, slut alert!"
533, Too bad you'll never find out.," Barney, what was on that tape?"
534, What?!," Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did."
535," Give it to me, give it, give me..."," Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?"
536," Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's..."," Play the tape, play it, play it!"
537," Hey, guys, what up?"," Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid."
538," I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.", Come on. Stay!
539," Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is."," Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it."
540," Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.", The kids still call him Funny Butt.
541," It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right."," Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today."
542," And I love you, Shannon."," I love your singing, Barney."
543, I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua., Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.
544," Mellow order, bro, mellow order."," Hey, nonfat latte to go."
545," Sorry, I only give high twos."," Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!"
546," Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.", Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.
547," I feel sorry for you, man."," Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion."
548," Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up."," Peace out, hombre."
549, You know what? This was a mistake.," So, what happened next?"
550, Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!, I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.
551," Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues."," Wow, wow!"
552, I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.," Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues."
553," Sugar Bear, where were you?", Barney.
554, But the Nicaraguans need us!," Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go."
555," Shannon, there is no..."," It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me."
556," As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad."," Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it."
557," I don't know, guys."," Oh, my God. What happened next?"
558," Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad."," Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story."
559," How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!"," Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad."
560, We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?," Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this."
561, But I love you.," Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff."
562," I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!", But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.
563, Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?, I'm just picking up my last paycheck.
564, You? It was you?," Oh, she got the tape."
565, The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.," Oh, you poor thing."
566," I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.", You've got to tell us.
567," Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?", Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...
568, Yes! Do it!," And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now."
569," Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.", Yeah. It kind of is.
570," Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight."," Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year."
571, Hi.," Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight."
572," Hi, Shannon.", Barney?
573," Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.", What are you doing here?
574," She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands."," Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life."
575," My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her."," Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse."
576, Yeah., Nope.
577, Yeah., Nope.
578," Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?"," Oh, Barney!"
579," Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.", Is your phone on?
580," Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!"," Ew, gross. Just stop it."
581," Um, are you coloring in your butt?"," Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great."
582, So wear another one.," I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt."
583," Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.", I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.
584," Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor."," Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world."
585," Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor."," A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding."
586, Noon. See you then.," No thanks, dude.  Noon?"
587," Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process."," Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?"
588, Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.," No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. k*ll me now."
589," Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.", Really? You?
590, Are you sure?," Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people."
591," Oh, excellent. We'll take this one."," Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all."
592, Here. Play with this pin cushion.," Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?"
593," Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.", God. I'm going to look hot.
594," Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.", No way. The Kid does not sell out.
595," Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash."," Yeah, but only, like, second base."
596," So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?"," Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own."
597," Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill."," Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp."
598," Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company."," B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price."
599, I most certainly did..., You set this up! You set this whole thing up!
600," 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.", What time is the interview?
601, Go for Barney.," Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there."
602, A sasquatch?," Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building."
603, Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.," That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor."
604," Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...", Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.
605," Yeah, I had it made. Sit.", There's one for awesomeness?
606, Please.," Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?"
607," Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.", My dawg!
608, Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.," Where, I don't, I don't see..."
609," What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.", I quit.
610, Please.," We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?"
611," Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily."," I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me."
612, Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?, What?
613, The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while., The package?
614," Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.", Lily doesn't care about that stuff.
615, Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier., She'll be happy.
616," Marshall, consider the penguins."," Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?"
617, On the wall., The penguins?
618," Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier."," ""Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."" This is a motivational poster?"
619," Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too."," And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons."
620," Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it."," Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched."
621," What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.", I'm psyched!
622, Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!," Wow, that was really specific."
623, And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done., So badly.
624, Whatever., Right. Get what done?
625, There's always a guy., Cool. And what guy is this?
626, You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?," Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready."
627, Nah. I'm so over karaoke.," So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?"
628," Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.", Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.
629," So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five."," Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend..."
630," Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?", He has a job doing... What do you do?
631, No. I know what you want. Magic., No.
632," Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?"," Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?"
633," Yeah, she told me already. Go on.", What?
634," Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.", Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?
635, That is a lie!," Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are."
636," Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!", It is not a lie.
637, What? No. It's 2:30.," Okay, it's time for bed."
638," You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.", Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.
639," I said ""almost."" All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.", You never had a four-way.
640," What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?", We're going home.
641, And it begins., Rock 'n' roll.
642," Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?"," Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m."
643," No! No, come on."," Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going."
644," Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry.""", Yes!
645," Trust that impulse, Ted."," I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it."
646, You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?, I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.
647," Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs."," You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her."
648, Count again., That's only two.
649, So get an escort.," Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours."
650, Why not?," By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?"
651," Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.", Because... gross?
652," Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.", You really think that's true?
653," Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun."," Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered."
654, Yes.," Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?"
655," That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.", No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?
656, Withdrawn., You just made that up.
657, Is that your water? May I?, 57 days.
658," Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump."," Yeah, go ahead."
659," Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool."," No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good."
660, You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.," Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp."
661, I said good day!," You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can..."
662," Yeah, it won't be weird."," No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird."
663, Because you're going to bring your own date., Thank you.
664," Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?"," Hello, Barney."
665," See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable."," Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney."
666," Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.", What the hell?
667," Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have s*x with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: ""B"" all night long.", You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!
668," The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.", I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.
669," Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tr*nny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.", 500 bucks?
670," Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? ""Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have s*x for money."""," Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there."
671," Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money."," Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time."
672, She's a paralegal.," So, Mary, what do you do for a living?"
673," Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.", Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.
674," No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.", Sleep with a prostitute?
675, Withdrawn., You just made that up.
676, So you and he aren't...?, I put him in a cab.
677," Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?", No!
678," That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.", What?
679," No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.", So she's not...?
680," I know, it was hilarious."," Not funny, dude."
681, I did it to prove a point., Why would you do that?
682," Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.", What point?
683," Come on, dude, you should be thanking me."," So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?"
684, Can you blame her? You called her a hooker., She slapped me and stormed off.
685, Your room?," Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room."
686," Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?"," Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now."
687," Lil, you know I can't promise that."," Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me."
688, Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer., Wow.
689," Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...", We already have a caterer.
690," No sweat, we'll just sneak in.", 'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.
691, Well...," It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything."
692, Lesbian., Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.
693," No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate."," The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian."""
694," Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got ""statutory"" written all over your body.", Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?
695," Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later."," 'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw."
696, Horrible.," All right, what do you think?"
697," You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.", You're gonna make such a great dad.
698," That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!", All right.
699," Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing."," No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday."
700, Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.," No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore..."
701," Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?", Aw. Sweet. Thank you.
702," Hey, ho, hey!", And you're just finding a band?
703," It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?"," Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate."
704, Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.," Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?"
705, She's in the bathroom.," Oh, hey. Where's Lily?"
706, How did you guys get in here?, All right.
707, You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume., We just snuck in the back.
708," You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?", Absolutely not.
709," And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.", I'll take what I can get.
710," I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted."," Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this."
711," Ah... Happy birthday, Ted."," Oy, gevalt."
712," Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.", Whoo-hoo!
713, Oh! Call an ambulance!, What?
714," Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.", What's going on?
715," I'm serious, call 911.", Is she okay?
716," Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!", What's wrong? What's the matter?
717," Oh, thank God, you're here.", And here come the paramedics.
718, I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital., What is going on?!
719, You've had a terrible fall., What are you talking about?
720, Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?," No, I haven't."
721," Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.", Give him your number.
722, What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number., Give him your number.
723, It works!, All right!
724," Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.", Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
725, Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.," Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms."
726," Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs."," I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do."
727," So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.", So?
728, And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him., Oh! Sweet Lord.
729, Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot., Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?
730," Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.", You?
731," Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.", What?
732," Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.", This is stupid.
733," Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him."," This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do."
734, Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.," You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?"
735," That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.", Tastes normal to me.
736, It got me as well.," Oh, God!"
737, Because now... you're in.," Well, then why did you have me drink it?!"
738," Yeah, it's probably a good idea.", Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?
739," Anything, bro."," Forgive you for what?  Hey, I need a big favor."
740, No., I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
741, What are you doing in Duchess County?, It's kind of an emergency.
742," I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.", Apple picking. Can you just get up here?
743, Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County., Is that Ted?
744," Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.", Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.
745, You thinking about coming to work here full-time?," You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there."
746," Thanks, Tracy.", Taking off for the night.
747, Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?, Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
748, That would have been bad., No.
749," Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.", So... what do you think?
750, That wasn't me. That was the universe.," Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this.  Ow! What the hell?"
751," I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name..."," I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment."
752," Nice try, buddy.", Then I guess it's not meant to be.
753," Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.", I was never going to take it.
754, What are you talking about?," Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is."
755," Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.", I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!
756, Yeah.," Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?"
757," Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!", Are you still in touch with her?
758," Did you just say a ""rain dance""?"," Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance."
759, A rain dance., Yes.
760, A dance to make it rain., Yes.
761," No, we are not!", Yes.  We're finding Penelope!
762," Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!"," Yes, we are!"
763," Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.", Why the hell should I help you?
764, Twice!," We had s*x twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?"
765, Shh!," Barney, there is no way..."
766, Hey., Kind of.
767, We weren't exclusive!, You hit on my mom!
768," Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.", Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.
769, There's so much of your mom in you., I will throw you off this roof.
770," Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad."," Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy..."
771," Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?", Thank you.
772," Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.", A rain dance.
773, These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!," Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour."
774," Well, then why are you doing this?", Yeah. I know that.
775," Oh, come on!"," Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!"
776, How about that? He did it., Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.
777," I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry."," Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back."
778, I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?, Thanks.
779," For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... . Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!", Sure.
780," So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancÃ©e. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.", Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover
781," You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.", You should write and illustrate children's books.
782, Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!," This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night..."
783, Mmm. Sunshine., It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.
784," Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's."," Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help."
785," They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.", There are a lot of them.
786," So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? "," See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak."
787, Those charges are from a month ago.," Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats."
788," For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... .", Exactly!
789," He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.", Why do you talk? Why do you talk?
790, You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza., No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. . While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.
791," OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.", Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. 
792, No!, Hello?!  A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.
793, Bold. Bold to go for the car.," Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?"
794, Barney.," I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing."
795, We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.," Uh, hey. Where are you guys?"
796," Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.", Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?
797, He's gone., What? What uh-oh?
798," Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!", You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.
799, You just checked out Robin's ass., See ya.
800," Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead."," What? No. I... Barney, I was..."
801," Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.", Lily.
802," This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.", Awesome! You're finally getting better.
803," Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?"," Oh, God!"
804, Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?, Candy.
805, Milk Duds., Mounds.
806, Um..., Gobstoppers.
807," Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer.", Dubble Bubbles.
808, Hi. Have you met Marshall?," Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17."
809," I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?"," Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you."
810," Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl."," Umm... I guess.  Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!"
811," Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...", You went home with her!
812, Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!," Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again."
813," My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night."," Oh, really?"
814, Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.," Oh, come on. Does that really work?"
815, Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.," Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?"
816, Excellent. Have you chosen your entrÃ©e?, Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.
817," Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it."," I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar."
818, Nice recovery. I think it's working.," Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on."
819," Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?"," Hey Barney, nice to meet you."
820, I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here., I hate you.
821, I know but tonight..., Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!
822," I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass."," OK, but no magic. . How did you do that?"
823," Marshall Eriksen, suit up!"," Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything."
824, Yeah you're good in that. Let's go., No way.
825, Come on..., Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.
826, There is nothing in my sl..., Sleeves.
827, Huh? Huh? Let's go., Oh is that right?
828, Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!, Behind my ear.
829," Hi, I'm Barney.", Great. Nice.
830, Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?," Oh, no."
831," Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too."," Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?"
832, I'm not giving you..., Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...
833, Stop it!, The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! 
834," Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. .", You don't want to see me when I'm angry!
835," No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. . Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.", Stop the cab! 
836, Hi Marshall., This guy like pennies!
837," OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you."," No, go away, I don't want to talk to you."
838," You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't."," There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it."
839," Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!", That's not possible.
840," Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.", A twin isn't the same person.
841, Ah!, Fine.
842, Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.," But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin."
843, How are you doing?, So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.
844," You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.", Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.
845, But they're twins., It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.
846," Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...", You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.
847,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. . Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.", Ted's my best friend.
848, Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight., That's so bad. I really liked him.
849," So then, I was promoted to assistant mÃ©nage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that?  Lily?"," Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why."
850," So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant mÃ©nage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!"," You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! "
851," Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played.", You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! .
852, I can't say I blame you., I'm going to k*ll him.
853," Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch."," Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too."
854, That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.," No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves."
855, I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.," Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs."
856, I can't say I blame you., I'm going to k*ll him.
857, Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.," Barney, what are you doing here?"
858, What?, I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.
859, But I'm your best friend.," Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about&#058; baseball."
860, I'm the most important person in your life.," Well, actually Marshall's my..."
861, How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.," Well, Robin's actually..."
862," Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today."," To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have."
863," Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint ""Bless This Mess"" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? ", I know you've all been excited to meet...
864, I know., I love salmon risotto.
865," Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...", How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.
866," Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?"," Stop it! Don't, don't!"
867," Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!"," What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass."
868," Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.", Can I help?
869," No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening."," That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful."
870, Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?," All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute."
871," St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service."," I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow."
872, I'll save you a seat., Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?
873," Susan, her name is Virginia.", Robin.
874," Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now."," Susan, her name is Virginia."
875," Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?", Why?
876," Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.", Wow. You're like a hero.
877, I'm... oh. ., Why don't you give the guy a hug?
878," I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom."," My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?"
879," Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...", Sure.
880, I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?," Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!"
881," Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side."," My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible."
882," You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ."," Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?"
883," Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.", That's not a real Web site.
884," Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure."," I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene"
885," Ooh, a piano!"," Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later."
886, What happened to Marshall and Lily?," Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important."
887," You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station."," Teddy bear, oh..."
888," Oh, no, what'd you fight about? .", We had our first fight.
889," Yeah, you did."," Wow, so it's the whole package."
890," Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.", Had to.
891, Had to.," Yeah, you did."
892," Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?"," You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up."
893," Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing."," That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck."
894," Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.", Robin thinks so.
895," I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.", I love it when you quote Scripture.
896," That's 'cause you're always like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude."," Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever."
897," Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me."," Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off.."
898, Ted? He's at work.," Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?"
899, Awesome story. As per usual., How did you get here?
900," Yeah, stay ", Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.
901," Yeah, you did."," Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder."
902, Ted Mosby... Architect.," Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way."
903, But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building., Ted Mosby... Architect.
904, Galloping.," Dude, dude, what are you doing?"
905, It is tonight.," Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted."
906," And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.", It is tonight.
907," I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing.", But why would you use Ted's name?
908," And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower."," Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it."
909," I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go.", You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?
910, Aaaaaaah!, Barney? Who the hell is Barney?
911, The fortress of barnitude? No way.," What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch."
912," Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.", Come on. She's desperate.
913," That's terrible. Well, see ya."," I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and..."
914," I'd let you, but I don't have any room."," Wait, can I stay here maybe?"
915," Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a s*x visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.", You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.
916," Wow, you really are desperate."," Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives."
917," Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.", I really am.
918," See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.", Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.
919, Yeah. That doesn't go away., It hurts my eyes.
920," Uhm, smells delicious."," I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch."
921," Lily, what was the first rule again?"," Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...  What are you doing?"
922, And what was the second rule?," ""Don't change anything""?"
923, Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it., There was no second rule.
924," Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says ""our work here is done."" Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gr&amp;acirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn...", I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?
925," Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.", Marshall doesn't have p*rn.
926," No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me."," And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper."
927, Hey. Did the cold wake you?, Yeah!
928," Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel."," No,I've just been watching you sleep."
929," Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...", I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.
930," I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look  Oh, I'm disgusting."," I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day."
931," Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um..."," Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you."
932, What? No. Yes!, Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?
933, Yes., Yes?
934," Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?  You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.", You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.
935, She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn.," Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?"
936," How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...", Thank you.
937, Really?, I'll do it.
938, I'll take it.," Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win."
939, Can you pass the arts and leisure?  Can you pass the arts and leisure?," I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...  Oh, you know what? Shut up."
940," Lily, I can explain..."," Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?"
941, Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back., Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I...  I was just about to turn on the tears.
942," Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change."," Yeah, that I just always wanted to do."
943, What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.," You know... Oh nah, never mind."
944, What did you have in mind?," Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here."
945," Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?"," Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets."
946," All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?", Oh. Ooooh!
947, Please. ," Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here.  Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?"
948, Eh. After the monologue., I thought you were going out.
949, Aaaaaah!, I don't know. I think he's in love with me.
950, I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?, Aaaaaaaaaaah!
951," ""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.", Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.
952," We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!"," Hey,it takes two to cuddle."
953," You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.", That's what you think a relationship is?
954, Uh-uh. You gotta go.," Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you."
955," ""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single..."," Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living."
956," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .", I'm sorry.
957, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo."
958," Really? Laid, you say?"," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid."
959, She hot?," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s."
960, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah."
961," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.", A what?
962," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.", What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
963," Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.", I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...
964," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.", It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
965," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin."," Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there."
966," Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?"," Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor."
967, Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you., Tell me what you want or get out.
968," Oh, my god. Incredible."," Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!"
969, C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!, Hmm... C minus.
970," I know, I know."," I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus."
971," Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.", You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.
972," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse."
973, I think I'm falling in love with you.," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."
974, What? No.We had s*x yesterday.," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot."
975, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.," Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier."
976," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.", So you're going back over there?
977, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name."
978," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year."," Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home."
979," That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.", He broke his hip.
980," Yeah, she was.", Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.
981," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!", B plus.
982, It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!, Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
983," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .", I'm sorry.
984, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo."
985," Really? Laid, you say?"," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid."
986, She hot?," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s."
987, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah."
988," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.", A what?
989," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.", What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
990," Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.", I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...
991," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.", It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
992," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin."," Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there."
993," Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?"," Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor."

999," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse."
1000, I think I'm falling in love with you.," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."
1001, What? No.We had s*x yesterday.," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot."
1002, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.," Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier."

1007," Yeah, she was.", Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.
1008," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!", B plus.
1009, It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!, Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
1010," Hey, guys.", You got it.
1011," Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.", Wow. A pedicure.
1012," Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?", We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!
1013," Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.", So are you in or not?
1014," Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.", And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.
1015," Oh, uh, once or twice.", You been here before?
1016," Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.", Barney!
1017," No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. "," Yeah, okay."
1018," Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?"," Oh, yeah, definitely."
1019," Marshall, I'm your best man."," Barney, no."
1020," And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.", Right here.
1021, Of course.," Oh, good. Did you get the veil?"
1022, Unbelievable!, Dude!
1023, Bright side: the bachelor party continues!," About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
1024, Hi.," Hey, it's Barney! Barney!"
1025, See you.,  Legen-...-dary!
1026, A... Chinese guy?, What the hell was that?
1027, Vultures.," Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds."
1028," Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.", Sweet.
1029," You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet."," Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative."
1030, They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.," All right, what was that look? What's going on?"
1031," Yeah, we are. He's a judge."," No, we're not."
1032," Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.", Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?
1033, I can get us that money.," Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it."
1034, Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?, How?
1035," Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.", Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?
1036," Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it."," No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away."
1037," Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right."," I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean."
1038," Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!"," Thanks, Barney."
1039, Why can't I do it just a little?," When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?"
1040," Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?", After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?
1041," Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either."," Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?"
1042," Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?", Why?
1043," Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are."," No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt."
1044," Come on, let's go."," Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are."
1045, To the Willowbrook Mall!," All right, I'm in."
1046, Why not?," No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls."
1047," Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment."," What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?"
1048," Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.", The 'oh' moment?
1049, Oh., It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.
1050, Oh.," I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out."
1051, Oh., I just turned 30.
1052," So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.", Oh.
1053," You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox."," Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets."
1054, I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you, It's true. They tell each other everything.
1055, Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?, Try me.
1056, Bill's bachelor party in Memphis., Doggie ate his pants. Yep.
1057," OK, Seattle."," Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?"
1058, Damn.," Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch."
1059," Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?", What happened next?
1060," Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography.", You know?
1061, They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.," My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French."
1062," Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it."," Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted."
1063, 'Cause it's p*rn., Thank you Barney.
1064," 20,000 says it's p*rn.", Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.
1065," Well then, what do you have?"," I don't have 20,000."
1066, I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet., No.
1067, Your hand is monstrous., OK.
1068, I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.," See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?"
1069," Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through.", I can see my hand print on your face.
1070, Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong., I won the bet. Why are you still searching?
1071," Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind."," Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn."
1072," You, you got something to say to me?", He moved there for business.
1073, Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.," You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you."
1074, Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry., One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.
1075, So I just got a very interesting phone call.," I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine."
1076, I know Robin's secret., What are you talking about?
1077," That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.", What?
1078," Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."," That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now."
1079, What?, Yeah. No I don't.
1080," Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!", Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.
1081," Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."," Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!"
1082," Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right."," Barney, don't, okay."
1083, Yeah you were., I wanna stress that I was young.
1084, They never do., And I didn't know any better.
1085, It always does., And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
1086," Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.", Oh my God.
1087, I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.," Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy."
1088," Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket."," So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?"
1089, Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.," Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!"
1090," Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?"," I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall ..."
1091," Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?", - No.
1092," One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?"," - No, thanks."
1093,  Hi. Have you met me?," It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman."
1094," Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.", - No.
1095," - Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.", - You have a brother?
1096, That's what I just said., He's exactly like Barney.
1097," Is ""gimme five"" back?"," Awesome, as per ""yoozh."" I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.""Legendarier."" And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five."
1098," Guys, ""gimme five"" is back!"," Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning."
1099," I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.", So what are you guys gonna do tonight?
1100, It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country., And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.
1101," Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?", And Barney always returned the favor.
1102,"  Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?"," Oh, my God, I do!"
1103," Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.","  Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?"
1104," Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?"," So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out."
1105, I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?," Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man."
1106, - Let's ride.," Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?"
1107," - Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers."," - Get off me, you pig!"
1108, - What? What?, - What? What?
1109, Let me know if he bothers you again., Cool.
1110, Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney., Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.
1111, - Boiling hot., - Break.
1112," Oh, hello. Have a drink.", Have you met my brother?
1113, What's gonna k*ll me? What's going on?, This is gonna k*ll Barney.
1114," No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.", B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?
1115," That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall."," We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous."
1116," No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex..."," And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting."
1117, Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.," Hey, bro."
1118, I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone., Why?
1119," I got... Who is this? And the answer better be: ""I don't remember his name."""," No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?"
1120, I don't support this., Hey.
1121," Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!", Gay marriage?
1122," Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick."," Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love."
1123, What? No way.," Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man."
1124," Oh, it's a freaking epidemic."," Two beers, one shot."
1125," Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.", Yes.
1126," Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.", I don't get manicures.
1127," You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.", You get your chest waxed?
1128," No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom."," Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this."
1129, Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people., Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.
1130," You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make."," Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him."
1131," What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.", Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?
1132, Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.,"  And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!"
1133," And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?"," Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom."
1134," Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?"," Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player."
1135," He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!", Please.
1136," James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah."," Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar."
1137," So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...", Barney.
1138," Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?"," Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life..."
1139," To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!", To get laid.
1140, - Why?!," - Yes, I do."
1141, What? There's gonna be a baby?, Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.
1142," Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?", Yes. We're adopting.
1143, To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers., For the rest of your life.
1144, Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to, - Cheers.
1145," Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic."," Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat."
1146, - May I?," Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic."
1147," Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?", - Yeah.
1148," Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...", I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?
1149," She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut."," Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything."
1150," And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret."," Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?"
1151, Then why don't you say it now?," Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word."
1152, Perfectly., Grinch. You timed that didn't you?
1153, Ted Vivian Mosby!," Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby."
1154, Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?, That's not my middle name.
1155, I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. , Like you've never said that word.
1156, Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?, Are you sick?
1157," I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year."," No, I meant do you have a cold?"
1158," I don't see any mistletoe, but... "," Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays."
1159," Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice."," Oh! Oh, God!"
1160, I'm not sick., You're sick.
1161, You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?, You're sick.
1162," Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. . High five."," Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?"
1163," Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... ", Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.
1164,...dary.," Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx."
1165," This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous."," Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual..."
1166, Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants., You just look like a regular guy.
1167, Yes., And isn't it more comfy?
1168, Too weak... to hold... bowl.," Come on, you need eat something."
1169, Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.," Fine, I'll feed you."
1170, But my throat hurts.," No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick."
1171, I hate you!, No!
1172, Don't leave me., I hate you!
1173, I left something in the hallway., Spider! Spider!
1174," Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.", Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.
1175," No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower."," Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus."
1176," The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars."," So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that."
1177," Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""", What?
1178, Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.," Yeah, I don't have any of those."
1179, s*x is fun., Totally. You should wait.
1180," I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary."," Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room."
1181," Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?", Barney was probably 12.
1182," Dude, me, too.", 17.
1183," Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm..."," Barney, you okay?"
1184, This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer., What camp?
1185," Uh, dance.", What did you teach?
1186," Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.", Dance?
1187, Sylvia," Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby."
1188, How you call your loverboy?," Yes, Mickey?"
1189, And if he doesn't answer," Come here, loverboy"
1190, And if he still doesn't answer?," Oh, loverboy"
1191," Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?"," No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story."
1192, Who's Scooter?," No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?"
1193," No, Marshall, they say,  ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other."""," I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other."""
1194, What are you talking about? We were here yesterday., I am so glad we're finally doing this.
1195, They've only had s*x with each other., We've only had s*x with each other.
1196," Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout..."," That's right, I almost forgot."
1197," I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...", Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
1198, I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer..., Risky Business.
1199," All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?"," That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it."
1200, Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love., Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.
1201," Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.", Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
1202, I have found that to be true.," Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that."
1203, Mona., Angela.
1204, Watch it more closely. Rock your world., Mona?
1205, You mind if I charge my phone?," Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby."
1206," Oh, my God! ", You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.
1207, Do you know about this?, What?
1208," Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.", What is that?
1209," I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time."," Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared."
1210," Oh, come on, Robin."," Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it."
1211, I know! We're gonna have so much fun!," No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun."
1212," Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools."," I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised."
1213," Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.", Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.
1214," Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art."," I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney."
1215, We totally saw your butt., We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.
1216," Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?", This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.
1217, I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three., Where is it?
1218," Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?"," You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?"
1219," Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.", Field trip!
1220," Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York..."," Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?"
1221," Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great."," You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting."
1222, Yeah., Are you serious?
1223, Paint me.," Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?"
1224, Paint me., What?
1225, Paint me., Maybe we can.
1226," We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story."," Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?"
1227," Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago."," Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting."
1228," I'll give you $5,000.", Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.
1229," Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift."," Okay, let's get this over with."
1230," I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.", Thank you.
1231, I get that a lot., I don't think your sword will fit.
1232, Paint faster!, Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!
1233," Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man..."," Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts."
1234, All right.," Oh, just drop them!"
1235, We had a deal!," No! No, this is not right!"
1236, You...!," Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!"
1237," Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.", It's over! . It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.
1238," You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",  We accept.
1239," Thank you very much, Lily."," Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it."
1240, A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme., Let's get out of here!
1241," ""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it."," Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem."
1242, Not a clue., No idea.
1243," Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy."," Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute."
1244," Have I taught you nothing, Ted?", So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?
1245, Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile., Virtually.
1246," ""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!"," Sartorial""?"
1247, Such a waste.," ""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!"
1248," A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce &amp; Gabbana. It must be so frightened.", I know. He was so young.
1249," Oh, thank God! I'll find out."," Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score."
1250," Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens."," Second down, everyone drink."
1251, I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.," Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal."
1252, Fine.," Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal."
1253," Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?"," See, there you go, he made it. You win."
1254," Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.", I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.
1255," $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.", Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
1256, That's impossible.," Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won."
1257," What the hell, I'm in. High five!", I'm in.
1258, Sorry. Solemn low five.," Dude, we're at a wake."
1259," Hey, take this key and swallow it."," As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world."
1260," Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.", What? No.
1261," I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key."," Lots more, no."
1262," Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.", Just went up to eight.
1263, Where are you going?, Not until game time.
1264, What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere., Pick up the hot wings.
1265," Sir, who won the Super Bowl?", I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.
1266, You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!, Sorry. I missed the game.
1267," Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.", I... don't really follow sports.
1268," You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?"," Yeah, I get that a lot."
1269," But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!"," The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh."
1270, No...!," Dance, my friend. Dance."
1271, I met Emmitt Smith today., I almost got fired today.
1272," Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game..."," Yeah, go ahead, Barney."
1273," I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?"," And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?"
1274," Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first..."," 50-50, give or take."
1275, Training for a marathon.," Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste."
1276, You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it., What?
1277, Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.," You're kidding, right?"
1278, Absolutely.," So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?"
1279," Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two."," Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles."
1280," 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",
1281," Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.", You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.
1282," What up, non-finishers?"," Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!"
1283," Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won."," Wow. Very impressive, Barney."
1284, So where's my 50 bucks?, I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.
1285," Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym."," All right. I got to admit, you earned this."
1286," Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight."," Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today."
1287, No., You're dating a girl from New Jersey?
1288," Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.", Hello?
1289," I was sitting here, totally minding my own business."," What, what are you talking about?"
1290," Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean."," I was sitting here, totally minding my own business."
1291," My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.", 86th street.
1292," Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?", Best 50 bucks I ever spent.
1293," Ted, Ted.", All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.
1294, I'm sorry. I can't.," Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?"
1295, Ted!, Barney?!
1296, No...!, Hey!
1297,  I can't go. I've got this thing.," You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun."
1298, A pen1s., What thing?
1299, I don't know. Is she fat?," Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!"
1300, I-I don't take flyers., Hot off the presses!
1301, That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?, You took one two seconds before you walked in here.
1302," Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...", Fine. It's a flyer from my play.
1303," Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play."," Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good."
1304," Yes, you should break up."," Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us."
1305," Oh, God, why is this part of the story?"," I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt."
1306, What's wrong with her?," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
1307," What word, ""moist""?", She hates that word.
1308," Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants."," Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants."
1309," I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.", Yes!
1310," Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.", They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.
1311, I side with Robin.," All right, Barney. It all comes down to you."
1312," Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.", What?
1313," From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory."," Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?"
1314, I know where I don't want to sit., Where do you guys want to sit?
1315, I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.," Guys, four together!"
1316, No? Okay., Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
1317, I am outta here., I am Rage... Envy!
1318," Wow, Lily, that sucked!"," And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!"""
1319," What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.", Barney!
1320," Yeah, if you're a Smurf."," No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about."
1321," Oh, really? You would?"," You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards."
1322," Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.", Yes.
1323, Even I wouldn't do that., What's the matter with you?
1324," Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.", I miss Jebediah.
1325," Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.", Very funny.
1326," Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong..."," Oh, we'll be there."
1327," Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.", Never.
1328, Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.," I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do."
1329, Moist., That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.
1330, I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over., And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.
1331," Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!", And then it just got weird.
1332," Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?"," Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show."
1333," Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting"," No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar."
1334, Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.," Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go."
1335," Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?"," Yeah, well, anyway."
1336," It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two."," Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?"
1337," The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.", We're moving in together!
1338, We insisted.," We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here."
1339, How's the Fiero?, Terrific.
1340," Well, I'm trying, but it's...", Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.
1341," Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it."," Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?"
1342," Aw, nerts.", No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.
1343, Really? Seems impossible.," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something."
1344," With privileges, from the sound of it.", That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.
1345, Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted., Eriksen. 
1346, How dare you...," I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit."
1347," Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.", I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
1348, Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!," Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?"
1349, Why? Why? Why?! Why?!, What? Why?
1350," Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.", Hey.
1351, Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.," Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys."
1352," Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.", To Queens?
1353," Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.","Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so."
1354," What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers."," Wait! You know how to drive, right?"
1355, Trick question., Which pedal's the gas?
1356," Yes, it is."," No, it's not"
1357," Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance."," No, it's not."
1358, This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.," Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up."
1359," Dude, a dog.", Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.
1360," What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted."," Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing."
1361, Which? Which one's the break again?, Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
1362," Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.", The left one.
1363," I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.", Why did you just turn on the radio?
1364," Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.", Relax. You're being crazy.
1365, I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.," Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!"
1366," We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!", We're okay.
1367," ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest."," Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he..."
1368, True story., So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.
1369, Yes!, Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.
1370," Rot in hell, devil steed."," Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace."
1371, Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?, Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.
1372," Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.", Long story. I'll tell you later.
1373, So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?," Oh, you didn't. That's right."
1374," Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?"," Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape."
1375," Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.", He doesn't say it. He sings it.
1376, What's on there?, Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.
1377, Retail price $319.99. What else?," Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer..."
1378," Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?"," Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum."
1379," No, I'm training.", Did you memorize our registry?
1380," I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?", Training? For what?
1381," Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right."," Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on."
1382," Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.", What?!
1383," Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars."," Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right."
1384," So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?"," His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance."
1385," I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""", What was that?
1386," Yeah, of course."," Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?"
1387," Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax."," Yeah, of course."
1388," Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? "," Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all."
1389," Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!"," Oh, wow, that was pretty close."
1390," Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father."," What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?"
1391, That's right. My father... is Bob Barker., Your father?
1392, That's right, Your dad... is Bob Barker?
1393, That's Pops.," The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?"
1394," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.", Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?
1395," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?"," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why."
1396,"Look, Dad, I got straight A's!"," Oh, I don't know. That guy. "
1397," So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am."," Want to play some catch, Pop?"
1398, Why is this so hard for you people to believe?, You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?
1399, Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.," Man, I'm well nourished right now!"
1400," Nooo. Oh, my God!"," Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right."
1401," Thanks, Da... Bob."," Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit."
1402," Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob."," And Barney, what do you bid on that?"
1403," Thank you, Bob."," Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive."
1404, $1 billion.," Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid."
1405," So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.", Lower.
1406," No, no, I want you to see this. This is great."," That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding."
1407, $999.," That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one..."
1408," I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game."," Oh, my..."
1409," Did you just... I'm ready, Bob."," I'm sure you'll do just fine, son."
1410," Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?"," Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far."
1411," Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass."," Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?"
1412, Overbid!," $17,640."
1413," Oh, I love this."," Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery."
1414," Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1."," Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?"
1415," $14,628.", And the actual retail price of your showcase is...
1416," Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right."," $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet..."
1417, Have your pets spayed or neutered.," Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you..."
1418," Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.", Why didn't you tell him?
1419," Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!", Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.
1420, And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.," So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle."
1421," Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.", But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?
1422," Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list."," So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp."
1423," Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.", How long is this list?
1424, Sweet! I can cross off two things.," Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant."
1425, Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?," Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional."
1426," Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.", No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.
1427," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy."," I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy."
1428," Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?"""," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy."
1429, Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?, Really? That didn't work.
1430, Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar., Bill?
1431, Uh... Don't think they do that anymore., Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?
1432, He kind of did.," Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?"
1433, I'll get it.," Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine."
1434, He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.," Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?"
1435," Me, too. I was up all night.", Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.
1436," Hey, Bill."," Hello, Lily."
1437, I need a glass of wine., I want... I want... Scooter!
1438," It's for the bride, so...", And I need you to get out of my face.
1439," White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda."," It's for the bride, so..."
1440, She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds., You got it.
1441," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin."," I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some."
1442, Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin."
1443, Hey., I'm on it.
1444, Can I have your phone number?, Hey.
1445, It's for the bride., No.
1446, The bride wants you to walk slower., Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.
1447," Well, it's not too short.", What?
1448," You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.", My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!
1449," Ah, let me see what I can do.", I can't get married like this! There's no way!
1450, I have a superpower., What? What can you do?
1451," Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?"," Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?"
1452, The bride needs this., Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.
1453," To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.", Barney?
1454, It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.," Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?"
1455," Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage."," Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate."
1456," Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.", Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.
1457," No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?", He's gonna cry.
1458, It's totally okay., No problem.
1459," Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?", I'm good.
1460, I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?, Slow down.
1461," Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?", I do.
1462," Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.", I do.
1463, Tell people what?," I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people."
1464, Tell people what?," Hi, Barney."
1465, Tell people what?," The food looks delicious, doesn't it?"
1466," Oh, okay. Tell people what?", Nothing.
1467, Absolutely. Tell people what?, Can we talk about this later?
1468," Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?", Hi. Have you met Barney?
1469, Okay. ," Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?"
1470, Tell people what?, Can I get a water please?
1471, Fine., So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.
1472," Oh, my God, just tell me!"," It's pretty big, though."
1473, What list?," Oh, that's great. Going on the list."
1474," Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.", Horrible wedding clichÃ©es we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.
1475," Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.", Yeah...
1476, Are those mini quiches?  Tell the secret.," No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well..."
1477," Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew."," Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?"
1478, Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.," What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives."
1479," Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away. So what was in the glass?", Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.
1480, You said that already!," Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow."""
1481, Don't get married., Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?
1482," An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do", Why don't I come back.
1483, So what happened next?," Oh, look, more strawberries!"
1484," Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it."," We have an expiration date, don't we?"
1485, Run? Your strategy was run?, Run!
1486," No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.", Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.
1487, You caught the bouquet?, Right? Right?
1488," That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted."," Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies."
1489, No., Risk it.
1490," No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over."," All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake."
1491," Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant."," Come on, they're cutting the cake."
1492," Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.", We love you. I love you.
1493, You did break up., I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.
1494, You're not pregnant?, Yep.
1495, An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?, Nope.
1496, You guys okay?, We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.
1497," I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together."," So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar."
1498," The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up?"," Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?"
1499," Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty."," No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?"
1500," I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.", Yeah.
1501, Ted?, Could be.
1502, Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?," Yes, Barney."
1503," Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it...", I do.
1504,"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full."," Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here."
1505, When will you be ready?, I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.
1506," Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.", I grew my breakup beard.
1507, Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah., I repainted the apartment.
1508," Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get ""Cirque de So-Laid"". What up?"," And the truth is, I was doing really good."
1509," Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?", That's my wife.
1510, Kyle?, Gael.
1511," That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.",  What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.
1512," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.", Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.
1513, Not possible. You cannot have s*x on a windsurfing board.," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me."
1514," Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have s*x. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had s*x in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.", How do you know?
1515, This conversation never happened.," To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian."
1516, Yes!," All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing."
1517," Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah."," ""I just want to make sure you're okay with this""? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?"
1518," Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!", Ted.
1519, Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted., Damn it!  He checks out...
1520," Let's bail, this place is dead.", What?!!
1521," Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?"," Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out."
1522, Yeah. But I didn't get to help., Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.
1523, Apology accepted. Let's go., So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?
1524," I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep."," Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy."
1525," Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!"," Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. Beat it, nerd."
1526, They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble., The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks...  sort of.
1527," You... your v*g1n*... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.", Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge v*g1n*?
1528," Your place? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love.", Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.
1529," Okay, this place is actually pretty nice.", I have a hot tub.
1530," Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn."," Oh, thanks. You should get one."
1531," No, he wouldn't.", Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink.
1532," No, he wouldn't."," Yes, he would."
1533, Nuh-uh., Yuh-huh.
1534, Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?, I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.
1535," Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?", Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.
1536," You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path."," I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo."
1537, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!, That dark path is my driveway.
1538, This is so going in my blog!, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!
1539, Okay., Want to have s*x?
1540," Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again.", Way ahead of you.
1541, What?," Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?"
1542, Ted?, Hum. Hum. What?
1543, I came here this morning because... I want to apologize., Hmm?
1544," See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now."," Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter."
1545," Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.", Hmm.
1546," Nothing, buddy.", A butterfly?  What?
1547," Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.", Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God!  I have a tattoo.
1548," You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.", Tramp stamp?
1549," Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.", No no no no no no no. Give me this.
1550, Go for Barney.," Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before.  It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me."
1551, What is it?," Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something."
1552, What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?, Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.
1553, No.  No!, What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?
1554, I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.," It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up."
1555, Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?," Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes..."
1556," Yeah. Wait, why?", I am such a jerk.
1557," That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen."," Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine."
1558," No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy..."," Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter."
1559," Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.", And here I am at the drum circle.
1560," You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker.", Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.
1561," What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.", Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.
1562," Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a ""Best if banged by"" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being ""Unevolved Robin"", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted."," I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina."
1563," I'm telling you, within three days...", I'm just happy Robin's happy.
1564," Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association."," Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words."
1565," This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.", What are we talking of? Baseball?
1566, That guy...," My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... ""Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother.""  And that's all I remember until the hospital."
1567," Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?", Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.
1568, No. Because he's from out of town., He's better looking than us.
1569, Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?," Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists."
1570,"  Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?"," Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning."
1571," Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted.", Oh.
1572," Hi, Colleen."," Hi, um, I'm Colleen."
1573," Hi, Lindsay.", This is Lindsay.
1574, Yeah.," Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around."
1575, Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?," Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch?"
1576, All right., We'll see you tomorrow.
1577, Okay. All right., I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.
1578," This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke."," I'm gonna go, too."
1579," Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude.", Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.
1580, Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?, I'm looking at you. What?
1581," Nice.  Nice. Hey, nice."," All right, Ignatius, one more hour."
1582," Knock, knock.", Hey. Our friends invited us to a party. You guys want to come along?
1583," Yes, we do.", Who's there?
1584," Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. "," Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. ""This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?"" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I...  And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked."
1585, ," Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson."
1586," Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands.", A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get k*lled.
1587, Well. I only had traveler's checks.," There were three of them, at least two g*ns... they took all our money."
1588, What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means., You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?
1589," ""Thank God we're alive"" s*x. It's even better than ""I can't believe you just proposed to me"" s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close."," ""Thank God, we're alive"" s*x."
1590, Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?, Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know?
1591, Theodore.," You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?"
1592, Teddy?, New Jersey?
1593," Oh, no."," Oh, no. Oh, no."
1594,"  You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc..."," Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!"
1595," Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?", Ew.  Can we get a ride?
1596," Welcome home, Scherbatsky."," After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin."
1597, Listening.," Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night."
1598," Use your words, Ted.", Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.
1599, The belt?," OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt."
1600, But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago., The belt.
1601, Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.," Yes, advantage Ericksen."
1602, You take too long to get ready," What? We agreed, I suited up."
1603, And then he starts on his hair. Ace.," Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve."
1604," Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes."," Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?"
1605," So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?"," You just made the list, bitch."
1606," FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough."," Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave."
1607, Stinson., Shekwakie.
1608," Yeah, we're not gonna make it."," All right, the beers are here."
1609," Yeah, pants are off."," Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?"
1610, That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.," Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean."
1611, Stinson., That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.
1612," You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape."," I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident."
1613, So you now have two on the line?," So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive."
1614, Go for the new girl., And I don't know which one to go for.
1615," Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.", Go for the new girl.
1616, Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think..., New girl? What new girl?
1617," That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.", I thought we were in for the evening.
1618," No way, no way, no way!", It's a tricycle.
1619, Put him on speaker.," Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts."
1620, So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?, Put him on speaker.
1621," That's right, it's resplendent.", You actually bought a belt.
1622," I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well..."," It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around."
1623," All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?"," Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?"
1624," Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.", Yes.
1625," Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?", Yes.
1626, Ted?, What? No.
1627," Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars."," No, but fifty will."
1628, I cannot allow Ted to do this., What are you doing?
1629, Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.," Why, why?"
1630," I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close."," But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting."
1631," So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?"," I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close."
1632, I'll get the video camera., OK.
1633, OK then., Get out!
1634, Oh my God., Wish me luck.
1635, Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.," Ted, you're ruining this for everyone."
1636," Oh no, the night's ruined!"," So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?"
1637, Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?," No, baby, it's not."
1638," Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.", Why would you do that to yourself?
1639," The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn."," See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?"
1640," No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.", It won't?
1641, That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one., Why would I want to tire them out?
1642," OK, wait for it."," OK, what the hell."
1643, Yes you can.," Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this."
1644," So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.", I'll see you on the other side.
1645, What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.," So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it."
1646," You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?", What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.
1647," You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!"," You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?"
1648," Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?"," Some stories you tell, some stories you don't."
1649," Ted, belt."," Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?"
1650, Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?," Ted, belt."
1651, She's totally hot and really fun., What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.
1652,  But she has a dead tooth., She's totally hot and really fun.
1653," If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!"," Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice."
1654, Shotgun., I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my v*g1n*
1655, Nice.," You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays."
1656,  But she's Canadian.,  But she's a g*n nut.
1657, I can't think of anything.,  But she didn't like Field of Dreams.
1658," OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.", You don't have a 'but'.
1659, The ultimate ice breaker., Why?
1660," A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.", The ultimate ice breaker.
1661, We got bit.," So, what are the eye patches for?"
1662, They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!, Both of us.
1663," Oh, Theodore..."," OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches."
1664,"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game."," Oh, Theodore..."
1665, Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.," Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen."
1666, Wow.," Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn."
1667," OK, Marshall.", I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.
1668, Which one of us has more game?, Yes.
1669," What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game."," Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me."
1670," OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert."," You're joking. I have mad game, bra."
1671," Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.", What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.
1672," Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.", Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.
1673, There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges..., Fine.
1674, That's good too., Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.
1675, How about her?, That's good too.
1676," Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?", You're on.
1677, I win.," Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars."
1678," Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.", How?
1679, I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.," Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook."
1680," By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.", Get out of my way.
1681," Whatever, Ted.", You see this. Game face.
1682," Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song."," Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?"
1683, Nice.," I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it..."
1684, Doesn't count.," One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered."
1685," OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know."," You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter."
1686," We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak."," Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing."
1687," No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on."," We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak."
1688," Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic."," Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?"
1689, And I only stirred that with my pinky., Fine.
1690, That's what you think happened.," What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped."
1691, Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?," OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any..."
1692," So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.", You are so sweet.
1693, Not even at all., So you never slept with her?
1694, It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?," Wow, that's good."
1695, Well?," Well., have fun in yoga"
1696, Oh., Well?
1697," Stacy, right?", I'm sorry.
1698," Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?"," Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?"
1699, I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae., I do.
1700," No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan."," Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band."
1701, We are two peas., See you later alligator.
1702," Wow, take care. Namaste.", We are two peas.
1703," So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.", You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.
1704," Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches."," So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing."
1705," Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy."," No, no, this doesn't prove anything because..."
1706," Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over."," Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy."
1707," That's what makes you so special, baby."," You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow."
1708," So, she's hot."," Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore."
1709, Then she's crazy.," Oh, she's gorgeous."
1710," Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.", No she's not.
1711, There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.," OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me."
1712, Let me illustrate.," Wait, hot-crazy scale?"
1713, A girl is allowed to be crazy..., Let me illustrate.
1714,... as long as she is equally hot., A girl is allowed to be crazy...
1715," Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",... as long as she is equally hot.
1716," If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."," Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."
1717, You want the girl to be above this line," If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."
1718," Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...", You want the girl to be above this line
1719,...then lose ten pounds.," Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head..."

1721,... then get a boob job., She'd stab me with a fork...
1722, I should give her a call.,... then get a boob job.
1723," I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts..."," OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class."
1724," OK, we'll see.", She's not crazy.
1725, It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.," Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted."
1726, Really? Sixteen no's. Really?," No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No."
1727," Oh, here we go."," Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap."
1728, Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.," Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags."
1729," OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it."," You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please."
1730, Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.," OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it."
1731," No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh."," Oh, I'm sorry about that."
1732," Wow, you bought that?"," Oh man, I'm really sorry."
1733," Are you a total idiot, Ted?", Ted.
1734, I like you Ted.," Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney:  Well played."
1735," Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.", I like you Ted.
1736, Barney. We met at the urinal.," Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live."
1737," Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit."," Oh right, hi."
1738," Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.", I'm not wearing a suit.
1739," Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes."," Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A."
1740," Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward."," Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes."
1741,"  Edward, this is Audrey."," Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward."
1742, He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,"  Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you"
1743, What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,  I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.
1744," And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.", Here. Call me.
1745," Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",  He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.
1746," Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?"," OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies."
1747," Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale."," Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that."
1748, She started the night here," Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale."
1749," But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.", She started the night here
1750, Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick.," But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone."
1751," How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times."," No, no no no no no no no no no no no."
1752, It was right over there.," How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times."
1753," Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.", It was right over there.
1754," I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed."," This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass."
1755," No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference."," You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da."
1756," Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.", I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.
1757," How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily."," Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her."
1758," Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger."," You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange."
1759, Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.," Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger."
1760, That man is a god., Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.
1761, I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.," For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once."
1762, Worst superheroes ever., And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.
1763, World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?," Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me."
1764, This is incredible!," I was working from home, because, you know, no distractions."
1765, I have big news!,  Oh my God! I can't believe it!
1766," Okay. My thing's pretty huge. But fine, you can go first.",  Oh my God!
1767, I just find a porno starring Ted Mosby!," Okay, I just found out..."
1768," I'm talking about welcome to the s*x plane, and look who plays the navigator, Ted Mosby ", What are you... What you're talking about?
1769, All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger., Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.
1770, Probably not the same guy., This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil war.
1771," Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby."," Yeah, it really is."
1772," Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... ""Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers""."," Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain."
1773, And I found a porno starring Ted Mosby., Wow.
1774," I know, right?"," Oh my God, that's amazing!"
1775, Congratulation for us all.," Oh, congratulations, Marshall!"
1776, The fact that I found a porno starring a guy named Ted Mosby... Let's do it!," Oh, let's go celebrate."
1777," Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p*rn star.", Apparently you can.
1778," See, this is way better than Marshall's intership."," I know what kind of plane this is. It's a ""boing""."
1779, More around the eyes., Oh yeah. A little bit. Yeah.
1780," Hmm. You're not wrong.  According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies."," Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p*rn.  This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous."
1781," Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique."," I'm sorry. Stop. I can't do this with a straight face. You don't want to work here. You're only here 'cause your dad went to high school with Joe Hewitt. Fact is, you just got a sweet job at the NRDC. And it's awesome. Man, I could have gone the non-profit route. I didn't. And it eats me up inside every day. I hate myself. I hate myself."
1782," Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting ""oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y""! And by you, I mean her.", What do you mean?
1783," That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?", He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.
1784, Don't wait up.," Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal."
1785, Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.," Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p*rn?"
1786," Well, I love commitment. I wish i could marry commitment."," Yeah i thought i was gonna get married to my last boyfriend but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues! That whole relationships, that 3 weeks of my life i'll never get back."
1787, I met a girl last night.," Well, I love commitment. I wish i could marry commitment."
1788, So perky and full of life and not at all fake., Really?
1789," C! And that wasn't spanish, that was cup size! What up!"," You're talking about her boobs, right?"
1790, Mmmm..., So these boobs...
1791," All right, Ted. Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Let's call them...", Paint me a word picture.
1792," I see. Between you and me, i'm also interested in this apartment. So is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you'rte showing them other places?"," Oh, they're on vacation in France for 2 weeks."
1793," Ted, do you think i have no morals whatsoever? I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment so i can nail her once and never have to see her again. I'm not a monster!", Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily?
1794, Welcome to my humble abode., Is what he should have said.
1795," Ah, make yourself at home. Please get comfortable. If you see something you like, just take it.", This place is so nice.
1796, Uh... That's my parents., Who are these people?
1797," Yeah! They're a chinese couple that wanted a white baby, it works both ways. Cookie?", They're Asian.
1798, You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen., Wow! Did you make those?
1799," I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't..."""," Wow, i feel so at home here."
1800," Yeah, we spent the night."," Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?"
1801," Hey, look at you."," Yeah, we spent the night."
1802, The only thing missing from that bathrobe are your initials., I'm wearing your bathrobe. I hope you don't mind.
1803, Only if she sleeps in the bed and i sleep on the couch., My mom's gonna be in town next week. It's okay if she stays with us?
1804," I love you. There, i said it and i'm not taking it back.", You're so sweet.
1805," How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles.", Oh my god! I love you too. I'm finally not the first one to say it!
1806, Works at every time.," How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles."
1807, Yup!, Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver...
1808, Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of., Is that why my Yorkie trembled for like a week after i got back?
1809," If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face."," Ew, that was on the floor."
1810," What do you think, make obsess?", And then Marshall tried to storm out... but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.
1811," I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab. ."," Nice catch, Robin."
1812, Ah!, bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.
1813," Robin, just..."," I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter."
1814," Robin, just...", They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.
1815, They can't... get divorced., This can't be happening.
1816," The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye."," Yeah, it is. It's weird."
1817," Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold."," Wow, guys! You scared us."
1818, No way! March does not have 31 days., Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.
1819, I gotta go.," But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together."
1820, What?," Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever."
1821," I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?"," I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago."
1822, Why are you guys even a country?, Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.
1823," Well, there, you said it again."," Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade."
1824, Slapsgiving., Said what?
1825, no., slapcountdown.com.
1826," No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.", no.
1827," Uh, thirty.", How many days are in october?
1828, Damn it!, Is also tomorrow.
1829," Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?", Damn it!
1830," That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?", Slapsgiving.
1831," Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving..."," The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it."
1832,"...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.", Slapsgiving.
1833," Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.", Really?
1834, Nothing but respect for that man.," How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?"
1835," Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely."," I'm going to make a phone call.  Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies."
1836," Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening."," Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here..."
1837," No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky."," You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?"
1838," No, no. Thank you, mr. President.  Sorry.", So you're not coming to make pies.
1839," Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, ""Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness."""," In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face."
1840," Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain..."," I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse."
1841, Ooh. terrible.," Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?"
1842, She's got you making pies for this guy?, Yeah.
1843," Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!", Horrible idea.
1844," Um, most Thanksgivings."," You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?"
1845, I'm not scared.," Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown."
1846, Please don't slap me.," Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum."
1847," Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!"," I'm sorry, what?"
1848," Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here."," I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?"
1849," Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!"," Well, no, no, no. you can't leave."
1850, Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!, What?!
1851," Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?"," So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last."
1852, I thought we were done with that?," Oh, no..."
1853," Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing."," You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving."
1854," How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?"," Barney, put it away."
1855," Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!", The slap will occur in ten..
1856, I will in... five...,...six...
1857," What?! Wait, you...",...three...
1858," oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!", I have a tattoo!
1859, what?, Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.
1860, what's matter with you?," Ted, why would you do that?"
1861, Dude... don't poop where you eat., What? What do you mean?
1862," You've heard of the golden rule, right? ""love their neighbor?"""," and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts."
1863," Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is ""love thy neighbor"", ok?... Now the golden rule is ""love thy neigbor"". But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: ""never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor."""," uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible."
1864, Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?," Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?"
1865," good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction."," yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair."
1866, It's true.," good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction."
1867, 12 of them., That's not even possible.
1868, Thanks., Here's your gin and tonic.
1869," But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them. Idiots! But still, you think, ""this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me."" And that step 2! Bargaining.", The attraction is instant and undeniable.
1870, That's the couples version of dating., we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.
1871, Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?," And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them."
1872, I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress., Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?
1873, Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?, No! Don't do it!
1874," Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other."," Yeah, with some sort of catchy name."
1875," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay."," Don't k*ll the bar, dude."
1876," Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this."," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay."
1877, That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.," We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off."
1878, Good night!, That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.
1879, Not at all., Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?
1880, Club soda can get anything off., That was an intersting use of the beverage g*n.
1881," hey, can i get a gin and tonic?"," It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!"
1882," oh, i paid for it."," See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic."
1883," Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks."," But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments."
1884, What the opposite of name-dropping?," we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks."
1885, That's what i thought.," Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here."
1886, you don't have... ," Dude, you got to flick it."
1887," Come on, guys, free nachos. What?"," Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge. "
1888, I'm not killing the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling.  It's fiiine., You're killing the bar.
1889, Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT., But it wasn't.
1890," hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there."," on my suggestion, you... "
1891, over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me., What? 
1892, okay. All right.," Oh, okay, thanks sweetie. "
1893, which brings to step 6., Oh no!
1894, Don't do this Ted.," Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow."
1895, Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory., Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!
1896, Yeah!, Ro! we are such idiots!
1897, I remember that.," ""Hey neighbor!"" ""Hey, neighbor""""Hey neighbor."""
1898, How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?, I remember that.
1899, tss ," We said ""don't do it!"""
1900," Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch."," You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?"
1901," Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!"," yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart."
1902," And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION.", don't k*ll the bar dude.
1903, I don't like you.," guys, we like you a lot..."
1904," I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.", We're getting a little sick of charades.
1905," other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.", Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.
1906, or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?," Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?"
1907," And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT.", or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?
1908, Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.," Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends."
1909, She's gonna try to k*ll me. This is poisoned., waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.
1910, Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me., What? You're being ridiculous.
1911," Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says ""no hard feelings"". She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?", What are you talking about?
1912, Where did Marshall get that hamburger?," Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?"
1913, You're welcome., Dude.
1914, Yet.," Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?"
1915, What?," All right, i'm taking off."
1916," Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.", You're such a jerk!
1917," Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog."," Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella."
1918, Thanks.  Crazy!, It just takes a while.
1919," Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind."," Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake."
1920, Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella., That's ridiculous.
1921," Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?"," Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that ""no"" into a ""yes."""
1922, You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.," Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled."
1923, Magic's not lame., You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?
1924, Is this lame?, I don't get it. I mean...
1925, I..., Barney...
1926," Yeah, but Ted provoked me.", We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.
1927, But...," No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there."
1928," You can't turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" Ted. Can't be done.", I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.
1929," No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group."""," I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually."
1930," Oh, right.", To Ted.
1931, I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan., The receptionist. That's my way in.
1932, Who?, That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?
1933," Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.", I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.
1934," Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.", No. I like Stella.
1935," I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.", What do you mean?
1936," Hold on, I gotta pee.  Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?", What? What is it?
1937," Oh. Oh, right.", What's the big secret?!
1938," Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please."," Oh. Oh, right."
1939," Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like."," Sure, what's it regarding?"
1940," I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!", I-I don't understand.
1941, What are your credentials?!," Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying."
1942, I want to know who am I speaking with!, Please don't do that. Please.
1943," At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.", I want to know who am I speaking with!
1944, Folliculaphilia., Folliculaphilia?
1945," Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.", What is that?
1946," You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.", That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.
1947, Y-you don't remember?, Why? Just why?
1948, I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache., Y-you don't remember?
1949," I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.", You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?
1950, Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.,...then he just kept toying with my emotions.
1951," Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?", Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?
1952, We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it., My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.
1953, I like you.," Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have s*x on it and then go shopping."
1954, Your team lost 20 minutes ago.," That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness."
1955, Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.," You okay, Barney?"
1956, There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves., Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?
1957," Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.", Of course there are.
1958," Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...", You could not be more evil.
1959," Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder."," Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl..."
1960, I was only gone for a second when...," Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder."
1961, See? Skid-proof., I was only gone for a second when...
1962, The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday., See? Skid-proof.
1963," God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog."," Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney."
1964," I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.", I'm really bored at work.
1965," Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?"," Oh, I want to take her home right now."
1966," Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.", Jerk!
1967, Lily.," Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
1968, No. Marshall., You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.
1969, Oh. No. Robin., You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!
1970," Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl..."," You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends."
1971," At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left."," Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl..."
1972," My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.", I'm so sorry.
1973, Why does this keep happening?," My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art."
1974," Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.", Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.
1975, Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda., But the next night got even weirder.
1976," Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?", You never gonna believe what just happened.
1977, No., Alan Alda?
1978," Oh, my God. Where is she?"," Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life."
1979," Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?", She must have left. She...
1980, Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?," She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy."
1981," That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!", Yes!
1982," Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?"," That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!"
1983," Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.", It's karma.
1984," My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with."," Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?"
1985," Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list."," Come on, let's see the list."
1986," This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?"," Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list."
1987," All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.", How many of these girls know they're being photographed?
1988, Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.," Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into."
1989, This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?," I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot."
1990," The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.", This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?
1991," Okay, okay, everybody! Hands."," Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!"
1992," Okay, toss up. ""Thought I was Jorge Posada,"" or ""You have my dead wife's kidney?""", Damn it!
1993, That's true..., She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!
1994," Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, ""Girl who thought I owned Google,"" up against the number seven seed, ""Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.""", I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.
1995," Yeah, she did.", She got the bends!
1996, I'm going with Evil Twin.," Barney, you're the tiebreaker."
1997," Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.", You're kidding me!
1998, Come on! Marshall?, Is that the blackboard from my classroom?
1999, Mosby?, I'm tired and sad.
2000," Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar."," I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her."
2001," Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.", You guys stole my blackboard!
2002," What do you mean ""no""?", No.
2003," Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car."," That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, ""I'm sorry."""
2004," Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna k*ll me!"," Barney, you're doing this."
2005," If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River."," Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?"
2006," Look, Meg, we need to talk.", What are you doing here?
2007, And I forgive you. I love you.," It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong."
2008," So you remember who this one is, right?"," No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol..."
2009," Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...", Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.
2010," Ah, there she is."," Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize."
2011," You're really enjoying this, aren't you?", Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.
2012," Anna, hi.", I'm making a scrapbook.
2013, What Web site?," Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it."
2014," You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.", Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
2015, She's...," Okay, which one is this again?"
2016, Is it her?, Larney! Die!
2017, You look good. Have you lost weight?, Smile.
2018," We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.", You look good. Have you lost weight?
2019," But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.", That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.
2020, Holly., Barney.
2021," Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes."," And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers."
2022," No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.", We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.
2023, That's not a bad idea.," Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up."
2024, I'm in.," No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is."
2025," Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!","...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation."
2026," Hey, there, how are you doing?"," I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move."
2027," Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?"," Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger."
2028," It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin."," Get your hand off my thigh, Barney."
2029," Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?", You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?
2030," Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x."," No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom."
2031, I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64., I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands?  Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?
2032," I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.", Are you okay?
2033, What? What?," Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry."
2034, So I apologized for nothing?," Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other."
2035," Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!", A new car!
2036, I just called it., You can't call shotgun for eternity.
2037, I call that I can call things!," You can't just call things, barney."
2038," What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?"," Oh, baby, I'm so sorry."
2039," I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business."," Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?"
2040," Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.", I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...
2041, Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.," Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car."
2042, Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.," And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report."
2043," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good."," It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it."
2044," Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened."," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good."
2045," Oh, snap."," You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass."
2046," Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.", Does this help?
2047," No, no, of course not... he died.", That's it? that's the end of the story?
2048," Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming."," How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?"
2049," Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.", Chain of screaming?
2050," It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.", I thought it was a chain of screaming.
2051," Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?", So it's not a circle.
2052," Oh, God."," Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten..."
2053," Hey, marshall."," After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report."
2054," If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?", How long have you been sitting there?
2055, What do you want?," Yeah, I was just about to order."
2056," A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please."," Okay, friends, what do you like?"
2057," Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else."," No, I didn't want meatloaf."
2058," Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive."," No, I don't."
2059, I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries., Who would I even scream at?
2060," Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries."," I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney."
2061, Marshall.," One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends."
2062," Hey, what are you guys doing out here?"," No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!"
2063," Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this."," Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!"
2064," Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity."," Well, that's just not true."
2065," Well, that's funny, cause I did!",You can't call shotgun for eternity.
2066," A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?"," Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!"
2067," I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me."," I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just..."
2068, Yell at me., What?
2069," What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot."," I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney."
2070, Yeah.," Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?"
2071," I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away."," This is me yelling at you, Barney."
2072," Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt."," This is me yelling at you, Barney!"
2073," No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.", You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!
2074, Yes., Your mom's a slut!
2075, Keep going.," Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!"
2076," Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.", I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!
2077," No, I'm kidding... keep going."," Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry..."
2078," Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.", I'm sorry.
2079," Ted, screaming never solves anything."," Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!"
2080, Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?, And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.
2081," Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?", Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.
2082," Sounds to me like he gave you your first ""O, Canada!"" face."," No, it wasn't like that."
2083, Did you ride his Zamboni?,"...and others were obvious, but needed to be said..."
2084, Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.," Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half."
2085, You're starting out with two big ones right there.," Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points."
2086," I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?"," No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt."
2087, Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.," I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream."
2088," So, Simon, how did you guys meet?", Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.
2089," I'm sorry. I've seen ""Let's Go to the Mall"" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it."," Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker."
2090, There's another video?!," No, I was in the other one."
2091," Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.", There's another video?!
2092," All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.", No.
2093, Michelle? She sounds hot.," You know who gets really bad revertigo?  Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle."
2094, No. What about Lily and Michelle?, You don't know about Lily and Michelle?
2095, What...  Do they make out?," Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out."
2096, Finish him!, The coup de grace.
2097," I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.", For reals.
2098, All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?," One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin."
2099," Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.", Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.
2100," Ooh. Really? Oh! Oh, come here."," No, tonight."
2101," Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome."," It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again."
2102, No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.," Right. Of course, the-the first being you."
2103, Your place?," Barney, do you want to come back to my place?"
2104, Are you sure you want to do this?, Your place?
2105," Of course. So, should I just put it in?"," Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?"
2106, Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.," This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked."
2107, Is that Alan Thicke?," Oh, I'm so glad."
2108," You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?", Yeah.
2109," Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad."," Yeah, you're right. I was lame."
2110," In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.", And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally...  they stopped watching.
2111," Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.", Check.
2112," Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend"," And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?"""
2113, Best friend., And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.
2114," Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan."," Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened."
2115," Okay. Right. So, Robin?", Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.
2116, Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?," Yes, Barney?"
2117, Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.," I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out."
2118, What?," So, tell us, what was it like?"
2119, I... I... I'm... I'm...," Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table."
2120, What are you talking about?!," It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there."
2121," Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?"," The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?"
2122," Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?"," Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?"
2123, I'll come with you., I'm gonna get a drink.
2124," God, this is awkward.", Okay.
2125, Being around Ted., What is?
2126, Because of our thing., Why?
2127, You're really gonna pretend this never happened?, What thing?
2128," Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro."," Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella."
2129," Hey, Marshall, I need your help.", Hello.
2130, I know. I want to hire you.," Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now."
2131, I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.," For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler."
2132, A little., How much?
2133," Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?"," Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal."
2134," Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.", Of course. Why are you upset?
2135," You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept...  I slept... I slept with Robin."," No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I..."
2136, Are you mad at me?, You slept with Robin?
2137, How's the hot dog?, I don't know.
2138, You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.," It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily."
2139," Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.", Why are you doing this to me?!
2140," I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code."," How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?"
2141," Bro Code article one:""Bros before hoes."""," For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic."
2142," Bro Code article 89: ""The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing.""", Some were unbelievably complicated.
2143," Bro Code article 34: ""Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."" Two dudes.", And some were just plain disturbing.
2144," You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?", This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.
2145, The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.," You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?"
2146, I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper., And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.
2147," And I shall l include a provision that stateth ""No eye contact in a devil's three-way.""", It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.
2148," I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?"," Listen, what do you want me for?"
2149," No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye."," Yeah, because you slept with Robin."
2150," No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.", And you would pay me for that?
2151," Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!"," Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?"
2152," Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news."," Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone."
2153," No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.", I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.
2154, What?!," Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's."
2155, Hey.," Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey."
2156, Good., That feels nice.
2157," Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.", I just wish we had some wine.
2158," Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!"," Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too."
2159, What if he never wants to talk to me again?," Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did."
2160,"I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office."," Hey, where are you?"
2161, Goat in a party hat?," Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe..."
2162,"Uh, gotta go. Here he comes."," In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there."
2163, Vegas.," Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?"
2164," Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.", Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.
2165," Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!", So there's no roof party?
2166," No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it."," Take me home, Barney."
2167, When did you find out?, You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!
2168, So you're not mad?," Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad."
2169, I'm so relieved to hear you say that.," No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this."
2170, You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened., Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!
2171, You mean... what position?  Stop it! Stop it!," How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened."
2172, Ted! Stop!, Hit him!
2173, Stop!, Hit him!
2174," Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face.  Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?", Hit him!
2175," Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio..."," You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, ""don't do this""?"
2176, What does that mean?," I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled ""stuff I have no use for anymore."""
2177, Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?, It means... maybe you belong in that box.
2178," Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.", I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.
2179, Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?," Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life.  The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin."
2180," I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?","  Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice."
2181," Sh! Let it out, let it out.", No I'm not.
2182," No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok."," Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?"
2183,"  Pitt, Barney Stinson!", So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.
2184," Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight."," Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while."
2185, So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? , You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.
2186," Starry Porten, Barney Stinson.", So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? 
2187," I need a new bro, what do you say?"," What up, chef?"
2188," Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. "," Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan."
2189, Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.," Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. "
2190, Yes finally!," What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?"
2191, Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. , Hello?
2192," Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute?  Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?", No. 
2193, Hey., It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. 
2194," No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.", What up bro-seph Lieberman?
2195," You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.","  Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro""."
2196," But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.", What a loser.
2197," Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. "," Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary."
2198, You ready?, Ok.
2199, What? What's the matter?," Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no!"
2200, Randy what are you doing?," Nothing, let's do this.  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!"
2201, ," Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!"
2202, 13 years??!!," Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x."
2203," So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.", Why would be looking for one?
2204, So where were we?, He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...
2205, Again? Really? Wait..., Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...
2206," Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?", Barney knew who to look for...
2207, What are you doing on Friday?, No.
2208, Stop! Amy?, What are you doing on Friday?
2209, Riiiggghhhttt!!!, Abby.
2210, Why are you trying to ruin my life?," Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen."
2211, And?," Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again."
2212," That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.", That's it.
2213," Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley."," Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?"
2214," Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.", Abby!
2215, Seven years!, Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
2216," Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid ""meaningful relationship"" with Stella.", Sorry.
2217, I hate Ted more., I hate Ted.
2218, Probably not quite as much., Are you as turned on as I am?
2219," I'm sorry I yelled out ""Abby."""," I'm sorry I yelled out ""Ted."""
2220," Oh, cool.", I am Abby.
2221, What?, You know what I hate most about Ted?
2222, You know what I hate most about Ted?," His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome."
2223," How he's always like, ""Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with."" He's so lame.", What?
2224, You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship., He's so lame and awesome.
2225, I think so.," Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
2226," Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?"," That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it."
2227," Hi, Abby."," Uh, yeah."
2228," That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?"," Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?"
2229," Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor."," That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted."
2230," You don't have to say it, though.", We're showing Ted how lame he is.
2231," Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing."," Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop."
2232," Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?"," Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop."
2233, I would never joke about true love.," Wait, really?"
2234, Okay.," Yes, I'll marry you."
2235, That's you.," Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom."
2236," Uh, yes, she does."," Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding."
2237, Totally committed to the bit.," It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle."
2238," Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?"," Hi, sweetie."
2239," Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit."," No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?"
2240," Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you."," So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America."
2241, Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you., What?
2242," Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.", Really?
2243," Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later."," Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this."
2244," ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke."," Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter."
2245," Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic."," Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny."
2246," I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?"," Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?"
2247, I think I'm in love with Robin.," Barney, just say it."
2248," It's not ""sweet."" It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything."," I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your s*x swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!"
2249," They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin."," Barney, you don't ""catch"" feelings, you just have them. And they're good."
2250," I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin.", Morning.
2251," I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really?"," You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?"
2252," ""Boyfriend""? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend."," Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend."
2253, I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.," Well, what do you want, then?"
2254," Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?"," Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that."
2255, Deal.," I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?"
2256, So just call her up?, Robin just needs to see this new see of you.
2257," Yeah, but those were just booty calls."," You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times."
2258," Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait."," On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say..."
2259, Sweet., And by 3:00 in the morning...
2260, It's no worse than your super-obvious code words., A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?
2261," Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?", Great. Now we need a new code word.
2262, How are you feeling today?, Just ask her something.
2263, At what age did you first get your period?, Something personal.
2264," No, I did not.", Did you just ask me about about my period?
2265," Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.", Just ask her out.
2266, Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing., I do.
2267, Why?, I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.
2268," Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot."," Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck."
2269," You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?", We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.
2270, Wish me luck., Ted hit that for over a year.
2271," So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened."," I really do, don't I?"
2272," I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.", What?
2273, Like what?, Why are you acting like this?
2274," I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful."," You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney."
2275, Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't., Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.
2276, Your teeth look fantastic.," That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man."
2277, Thanks.," What part, what part?"
2278," I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.", Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?
2279, Why not?," There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply."
2280, We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply., Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.
2281, Promise me you'll apply., It's not as easy...
2282, To taking chances.," I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly... ""Stop watching me, jackasses."""
2283," You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.", To taking chances.
2284, Of course it is. One more for the road?, Last call.
2285," So, here's the deal."," Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear."
2286, Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?," April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam."
2287," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.", So are you... nervous about the game?
2288, And that was it.," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go."
2289," My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true."," When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?"
2290, I choose bimbos.," Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now."
2291," Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.", What?
2292," Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?"," This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused."
2293," Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!"," See you, Barney."
2294," Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt?  Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job."," Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?"
2295, Italian., We had sushi last night.
2296, I don't like Chinese., Oh.
2297, I just said I don't like Chinese., Indian?
2298," Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?", Indian isn't Chinese.
2299, I just said I don't like Chinese., Mexican?
2300," I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.", It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*lled it and ran it through the meat grinder.
2301, Name two places where things get stuffed., And there it was.
2302, You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying., Probably tucked between her legs.
2303, Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.," There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?"
2304," No. No, we don't know where it is."," And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face!"
2305," I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!"," Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat."
2306," OK, Regis, we will, we will."," I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!"
2307, All right.,What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!
2308," You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment."," Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat."
2309," How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs."," Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame."
2310, Reg...  That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text., We should probably call Regis.
2311, All right., Just shut up and eat.
2312," I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?", I think I just had my first burg-asm.
2313," You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC."," Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually."
2314, Barney Stinson., 106. A numbered street. Of course.
2315," I'm sorry, this is...?"," Barney, where the hell are you?"
2316," Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.", Regis. I'm at the place.
2317, Onions?," What? Uptown? He breaks a mail box. Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare."
2318," Okay, no onions.", Onions?
2319," One of 9,000 convenient locations.", This is it.
2320, What the..., But... food.
2321," It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily."," This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this."
2322," Marshall, Geez."," I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!"
2323, Will you just tell her already?," They suck, suck!"
2324," Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor."," Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together."
2325," If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.", I haven't worked since March.
2326, Member FDIC.," If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now."
2327, This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.," Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me."
2328, That's outrageous., What? Come on.
2329," Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick."," During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem."
2330," Hi, Ted."," Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?"
2331, T-Diddy! You've missed that!, Theodore!
2332," First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.", Why?
2333," Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian."," It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact."
2334, You can be at 22h.," With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h."
2335, No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!, That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.
2336, Marshall., For torturlute? You're right.
2337, Lily., You deserve better than that.
2338, Stella., Not good enough.
2339," I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not.", Sorry.
2340," Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!"," Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?"
2341, Air Hockey. Well done my fat.," It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey."
2342," Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much! You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.", I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.
2343, How so?," It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview."
2344, Naughty., Thank you.
2345, You can not.," That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?"
2346," If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www...", I called Joel.
2347, This is the look.," not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time."
2348, I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200.," It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you."
2349, $ 10 000.," Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer."
2350, They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional., It's the tears?
2351," Robin, hangs up. Do not do that."," Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel."
2352," Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it.", You can never be in town in 30 minutes.
2353," Oh, yes. Tape for safety."," Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more."

2355, Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!, New Jersey coast.
2356," Small town, big men, then tope."," Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?"
2357, Silence embarrassed. Tope then.," You know what, Ted... Live wherever you want. I do not care."
2358," Look, it did."," Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York."
2359, You think you're there for something?, It really stops.
2360," Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I k*lled my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!"," I think so. Good job, Barney."
2361," In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight.", What are you doing?
2362, Vive la vodka.," Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?"
2363," I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on."," My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?"
2364, My God! How do you know that?, Global warming?
2365, It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!, It's good enough!
2366, This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!, Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all.
2367," Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?", No.
2368, You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?, It's true. We live.
2369, What?," We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest."

2373, I meet this challenge.," Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80."
2374, Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup., What challenge?
2375, 83 years. How old are you?, You're cute. How old are you?
2376, I think someone owes me $ 200.," Oh, my God!"
2377, It's amazing., Amazing.
2378, I would much Red Bull., Not at all.

2381, I'll tell you., No time.
2382, What?, Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.
2383," No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know..."," No ""You not married, Ted?"" No ""You're making a big mistake, Ted?"" Have you stopped the fight against marriage?"

2390, What? No. Robin must come.," I know. I understand something is ""no ex"". Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone."
2391," Dude, Robin has to be there."," I do not care, why do such."
2392, What are you parl..., It should not come.
2393," Co-witness, I'll handle this.", It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.

Mine was always there, waiting for me."
2437, Absolutely not., And those girls over there? They are cannon.

2879, I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.," Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?"

2941, What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere., I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?
2942," Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle."," Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag."

I'm too old for this stuff."," Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem."
2970, And then the hospital.,"... that Murtaugh kept repeating: ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag."

2977, You know for layoffs?, I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.

2982, It's always food., I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?
2983, You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man., It's always food.

2989," If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere."," Okay, but PJ does not help."
2990," PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?", You see? It is useful.
2991," A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?"," No, I guide him."

2999," Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.", Great! Great! I Simulates-man!
3000," Hi, Frank."," OK, guys?"
3001, Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club., Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.
3002, Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.," Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep."
3003, Last week!, A waste?
3004," I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!"," This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice."

3007," It's funny anyway, right?"," I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives."
3008," You see, Sports-man. People adore you.", You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.
3009, You're kidding!," Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again."
3010," As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...", How are you?
3011, What?, I know you're in love with Robin.
3012, She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time., Lily told me.
3013, Really?," Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other."
3014," Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.", It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.
3015," No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.", Tell her how you feel?
3016," You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.", I can perhaps help you.
3017," Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.", I'll find something.
3018," Hey, Toy-man!"," Hey, Chow-man!"

3021," Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.", I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.
3022," And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys."," Yeah, it's true."
3023, You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.," You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw."
3024, Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.," This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him."""
3025, Jesus.," My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?"
3026," Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say:"" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude."""," Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus."
3027," And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.", The dialogues seem pompous old now.
3028," And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story."," I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking."
3029, What?, Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!
3030," We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.", You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?
3031," ""Piti texting""?"," We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages."
3032, Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.," Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous."
3033," It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy.", It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.
3034, He put the boots!, I wear them right now and they are very sexy.
3035, Or... we remove our shirts., He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.
3036," Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.", It's better.
3037, It is hot., I believe that wearing anything underneath.
3038, Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?," There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!"
3039," The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything."""," No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look."
3040, We all know what it gave., The same he had with you the first time.
3041, And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.," It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her."
3042," ""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? """, First: he jokes with the marriage.
3043," ""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. """, Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.
3044," ""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. """, Third: it says too early personal things.
3045, And then we met Stan.," Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought."
3046, A guard who works nights., Super Stan. Who is it?
3047, And he had not finished., He eats here every day.
3048, No matter. It's OK., It's... really nice.
3049," Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you."," I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here."
3050, How is this possible? It's all there waiting!, It is perhaps not in love with us.
3051, All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything., That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?
3052, Yes.  Or...," It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?"
3053," That's it, man. This is the ""I love you."""," He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. """
3054, Stan. What?, I would like Stan to be there.
3055," ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. """," ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend."""
3056, Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.," Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?"
3057," Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state."," Dude, I'm his best friend."
3058, I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.," That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do."
3059, I know. It's weird.," Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he Ã©poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?"
3060," Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.", I know. It's weird.
3061, You can tell us. This is a secure area.," It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing."

3176, So... You're in love with me?, You got beat by a girl.
3177, You can stop. Lily told me everything., What? Yes. Much.

You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that."
3180," It's going pretty fast, do not you think?"," Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, ""stifles it in the bud"" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you."

3203," Yes, we do. Or. Or..."," Okay, now, we have to figure this out."
3204," Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, ""I don't know.", We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.
3205," Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on."," Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret."

3207," Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?"," Barney, it was awful. I was teaching..."
3208," Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.", I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.

3211, Run tell that., You have to make things clear.
3212," Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.", Define the relationship.
3213," Lily, can't you just let us be happy?"," Yes! No! Lily, private convo time."
3214, And that's not happy?, You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.
3215, Why? Give me one good reason., Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.
3216," Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.", I'll give you 20...
3217, Hey Brad., Hey Barn!
3218, We're not gonna have the talk., Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.
3219," Thank you, Ted.", What?!
3220, What?!, Because Robin is already his girlfriend.
3221," How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins."," MacLaren's Bar, four years ago..."
3222," Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them"," ""Gremlins""?"
3223," No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.", What about brunch? Is brunch cool?

3226, Hey Brad!, Why not? Lay it on me.
3227," Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!", Hey Brad!
3228," Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on."," It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend."
3229, A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend., That's putting it a bit strongly.
3230, Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.," Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?"
3231," Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.","  Wait. Does professor have one ""F"" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two ""F's"". That looks right. I think that's right."
3232," No, I meant punching Brad."," We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far."
3233, No.," God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?"
3234, We are not having the talk!," No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go."
3235," Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here . Okay, good luck. Byesies."," Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg."
3236,"  Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?","  Nice job, Ted."
3237, Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?,"  Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on."
3238," I know, right?","  Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy."
3239," I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend", Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?
3240, Maybe we should go back to being just friends.," Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine"
3241," Good. Me, neither.", Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.
3242, We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?, Friends isn't gonna work.
3243," I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...", I know something we're good at.
3244," And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.", Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.
3245," And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome."," We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other."
3246, She can handle her Scotch., And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.
3247, And she's my girlfriend.,  He's my boyfriend.
3248," Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.",  She bought it.
3249," You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good."," Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?"
3250, Flugelhorn?," Well, lead the way, sweetie pie."
3251," Guess who just got four tickets to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" Star Wars exhibit?", Neither did I.
3252," No, I said, ""Guess who?""", Why?
3253," Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?"," What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?"
3254," We're not going to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls."," Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful."
3255, My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.," Wait a second, the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?"
3256," Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily."," Barney, why are we here?"
3257, You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.," Thanks, man."
3258," Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime."," Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?"
3259, What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women., Married!
3260, False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile., I do! It's just not that easy.
3261," That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies."," And then watch out, because it is on!"
3262," I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind."," It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it."
3263," Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!", Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?
3264," I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!","  Yeah, I can't talk right now."
3265," Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas."," Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture."

3267, We saw the third doppelganger!," Dude, um..."
3268," Hey, hey, hey, hey! ", I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like
3269," Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. "," And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that."
3270," Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.", Oh!
3271, Busted., So you went to a strip club?
3272, Marshall made me go., So... Strip club.
3273," See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.", Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.
3274, Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time., I'm not cool with it.
3275, Because it's harmless., It's disgusting.
3276," And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.", Did one of your whores tell you that?
3277," Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here."," It's, no, it's nothing."
3278, Psst! Ted! ," Yeah, that would've been good."
3279,"  You know, I don't come here that much.", Bring out Stripper Lily!
3280," Thank you, kindly stranger."," Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching."
3281, You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less., Wow.
3282, Just the best.," I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this."
3283, Just the best.," Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room."
3284, Mm-hmm. And yes... we can., Barack Obama Jr.?!
3285, Hey. What's wrong?," And it's not just that, it's other things."
3286," Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.","  I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just..."
3287," And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have s*x. Mm-kay?"," Oh, thanks."
3288, She really said that?, Bowl?
3289," Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--"," And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present."
3290," I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!", Mm-hmm.
3291, ...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!, Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.
3292," Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?", ...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!
3293, Okay.," Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her."
3294, I'm bored.,"  ""How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."" Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down..."
3295, Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?, You said you wanted my help.
3296,"  No, like, really big boobs.", We did that ready.
3297, Can we have class outside?," No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me."
3298," What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- ""H's"" or no?", Barney!
3299, They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?," Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?"
3300, Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70% off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid.," Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?"
3301, You guys just had s*x? Oh! Wasn't me.," Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean?"
3302, Okay.," Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just..."
3303, That's a building.," This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter.  Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?"
3304, Dude!, Oh...  That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...
3305, Whoa..., Right. The most important facial expression of all.
3306," ""You're an idiot""?"," Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call ""touchy-feely."" She doesn't say, ""I love you,"" like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, ""You're an idiot."""
3307," I can't believe I'm taking sexual advice from Ted Mosby. That's like taking fashion advice from... well, Ted Mosby."," Oh, yeah...lefty like that."
3308, What do you mean?," Three: ""Never, ever play the 'Guess Who' game with her."""
3309," Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.", Barney! Do you have a problem with this class?
3310," Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor? ."," Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say."
3311, What...," Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz."
3312, Trick question. Get her butterscotch.," When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?"
3313, Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women., Correct! Why?
3314, To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time., Correct! What is Robin's dream job?
3315," No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: ""Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"""," Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?"
3316," ""Oh, Captain! My Captain!""", Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.
3317," I know, right? The end? Tears.", How good was Dead Poet's Society?
3318," I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?","  Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh."
3319," Marshall, did you sells out?", What the hell do you two think you're doing?
3320," On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises."," Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English."
3321, Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!," You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?"
3322, That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.,"  And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence."
3323," Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.  But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small"," I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve."
3324, Hmm?, You know...
3325, And your work address.," That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address."
3326, Whoa., And your work address.
3327," Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch."," Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on."
3328," Because the people who wear them are constantly going, ""Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?"""," You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches."
3329,  Worst night ever., Best night ever!
3330," It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.", Really? How?
3331, And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.," In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!"
3332," Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.", Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.
3333," And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out."," P.S., not sitting great."
3334, This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night.  It's called itwasthebestnightever.com., Show him.
3335," Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses."," Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day."
3336," I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much."," I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?"
3337," Let's do it again, soon."," Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water."
3338," Uh, no, it doesn't."," Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens."
3339," Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?"," Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon."
3340,  You're the sexless innkeeper., Westchester. Why?
3341," Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?"," What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?"
3342," T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens.  The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...", Not really.
3343," Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you"," Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?"
3344," Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket"," Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?"
3345," I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.", No way.
3346," Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition."," And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there."
3347," Plus, the alien thing."," Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys."
3348, I think they bought it., You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.
3349," Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?"," Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard."
3350," To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?"," Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize."
3351," Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.", For god's sake!
3352, Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.," Hey! Hey, guys."
3353," Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out."," Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week."
3354, Who the hell are these people?," Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel."
3355, Pfft. Not us.," Pfft, who needs 'em?"
3356," Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.", Just the two of you?
3357, Maybe. But they're Armani.," Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?"
3358," Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?", You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.
3359, We'll never sleep on thegouda again.," Come here, you two."
3360," No, not really."," Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?"
3361, With quill?," 'twas the night before, I had hours to k*ll.  I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill."
3362, No way. You made that up.," Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper."
3363, Whew!," Are you coming back bed, professor?"
3364," The... mmm. Social experiment.  U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A...", You want to go? You want to go?! Come on!  Make fun of the Great White North all you want. It's the best country in the world.
3365, What do you mean?," I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already.  Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an ""I"" to a ""We""."
3366, Hmm., We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.
3367, Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.," Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen."
3368," I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this."," Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am."
3369, A cit...," Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow."
3370," No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...", I'll think about it.
3371, Sorry. It's a rich area.," Okay, Barney."
3372," But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.", It is.
3373, It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?, How do you know the Canadian test is easy?
3374," I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing.", We most certainly did!
3375, Okay.," Yeah, I heard him."
3376," ""How many stars are on the flag?"""," That reminds me, I have to pee."
3377," ""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?"""," 50, one for each state."
3378," Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: ""Who is this?"""," The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready."
3379," No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: ""What the hell is this?""", Queen Elizabeth II.
3380," Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin."," Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played..."
3381, Correct., I want to say- Jefferson?
3382, Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson., Oh!
3383," All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?"," Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!"
3384," Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?"," That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy."
3385," Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your g*ns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American."," Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face."
3386, Good morning.," When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight."
3387, You went Canadian.," Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?"
3388, This Canadian.  Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto., How Canadian?
3389," You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic..."," How did you find me, anyway?"
3390," You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.", Canada isn't across the Atlantic.
3391," God, you're still drunk."," Barney, I'm not taking the test."
3392," Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee."," Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be."
3393, It's like an entire country without a tailor., I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.
3394, What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.," American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No ""please"" or ""thank you"" for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian."
3395, And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.," Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either."
3396," Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back."," Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please."
3397," Okay, that's it.  Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a ""tie""."," When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country."
3398," Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.", Okay. Let's listen to it again.
3399, Hmm.," Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool."""
3400," Wait, you can do that?"," And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian."
3401, I see.," Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two."
3402," No, I can see out of my left eye again.", You understand?
3403, I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced., I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.
3404, Look what I saw yesterday., Not at all.
3405, I gotta go., No problem.
3406," She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.", I gotta go.
3407, They have a big problem., There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.
3408," If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half."," I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever."
3409, An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop., And a half?
3410, Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here., What's new?
3411, I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.," Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?"
3412, Let me ask you a question.," Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue."
3413," Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?", Go ahead.
3414," So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.", Not really.
3415," You argue. Robin, we do not fight."," But if I said that, we will play, so..."
3416," No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...", Of course I do.
3417, It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said., So when you think you will play and you get up you go?
3418, Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments., I can not believe Robin supports it.
3419," There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily."," But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed."
3420, Okay., Go to the basics!
3421," Thank you, doll.", Okay.
3422," I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?"," Honey, you're going to wash it?"
3423," Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.", No. Of course not.
3424, It's because you're a woman., Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.
3425, Of course not., I do not even know why we laugh!
3426," Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery."," Wait, Ted. Listen to the man."
3427," Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes."," Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery."
3428," Now, turn around.", You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.
3429, The piercing was cool.," No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003."
3430, You're welcome., I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!
3431, I told you., I think that's true.
3432," Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!", Thank you.
3433, Okay., How was the trip?
3434," It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?", What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?
3435," short, and your weekend?", We all came out a year.
3436," What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""?"," I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?"
3437," You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits."," Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize."
3438, What do you eat?, This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...
3439," Hey, Ro-Ro."," Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer."
3440," As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby.""", Nothing. We're just happy.
3441, How will Marshall and Lily?," And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin."
3442," You and your big, huge heart."," Those two worry me, really."

3648, Costumes!," What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?"
3649, Do we see., What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?
3650," I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dÃ©pote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more...

3656," It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach..."," But um, it would seem, she often said."
3657," Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said ""But um"" so often?", It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.
3658," Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2."," She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous."

3672, Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.," Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder."
3673, You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.," It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield..."

3699," Uh, Jim, I told you I wanted to talk about it."," Hey, on another subject, you really think you could get fired today?"
3700, What a c**t.," Barney, I go straight from your imagination, so apparently we must talk! Think about it."

3735,"  Hey, baby..."," No, no, I love it so much. It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Give it, give it."
3736, It's not your phone. , It's mine now.
3737, It's the lure of Ted.," Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras."
3738, A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track., Bait?

3741," Yes, you can borrow.", I can borrow your mini pig?
3742," Yes, completely.", What? I am not to his hook.
3743," It's like that. ""I can not be with you"". ""For now."""," ""For now"" you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen."
3744, Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?, I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday.
3745," Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever."," No, moron!"
3746, Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?, There she is.  It has led to colleagues.
3747," There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?", Yep.
3748, And you never thought to say?, How do you know?
3749," That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*ns, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?", What? It's just a job.
3750," It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, ""Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. "" So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.", I will not say explicitly.
3751," Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees burned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!", She touched my nose.
3752," There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever.", Not as much. Not as much.
3753, Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?, So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.
3754, It's over., Let's go have a drink.
3755, The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era., What?
3756," Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!", You're a little dramatic.
3757, I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits., You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?
3758," The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!", Why change your mind?
3759, It all started a week ago.," Okay, big guy, tell me all along."
3760, I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady., It all started a week ago.
3761, Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie., Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.
3762, It was not my best tie., But this is merely a tie.
3763," So, right after that, I took her home.", Right.
3764," Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow."," When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover."
3765," What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.", Good night.
3766," I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners."," Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier."
3767, Continuous. Continues.," I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse."
3768, Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns., It's the cashmere?
3769," Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.", 12 microns. I like the tight fibers.
3770, She did it too!," Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle."
3771," You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail."," And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? """
3772, Did you just say you got a kid!," It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass."
3773, Completely., You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.
3774, Of course. Well..., Or the second. Or the third.
3775, Just tell me how!, Or the fourth.
3776," Excuse me, someone is using this stool?", 17.
3777," I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted..."," If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up."
3778, I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it., From Robin is Robin.
3779, I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.," You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you."
3780," This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and..."," I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it."
3781," Spoilers. Regardless, we did.", It does.
3782, Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?," I know, but the song is rather catchy."
3783, Tell me., There is another option... but you're not ready.
3784, A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?," If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date."
3785, Okay.," If you want my help, it's a super hot date."
3786, You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?, Let me do it. I will plan everything.
3787, What are you doing?, Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...
3788, They look at us., You just gotta make him understand...
3789, Really? You really gonna do that?, How important it is for you...
3790, It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?," In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date."
3791, Why did you do that?," I'm fine, I'm fine."
3792, Why are you angry against me?," Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire."
3793, The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning., You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.
3794," What, she is upset?"," Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you."
3795, You should have seen., Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.
3796, We go back home..., I'm going.
3797, I can not believe that Robin is upset., We go back home...
3798," I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up?", And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.
3799, I know where.," Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where."
3800, I know you're upset.," Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date."
3801, You sure you're not upset?," What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart."
3802, You're not another number for me., Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?
3803," I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?"," And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks."
3804," Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want."," Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you."
3805, I promise., Do not sleep with Anita.
3806, It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go., Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?
3807, I wanted to call you.," Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved."
3808," I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no."," I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?"
3809, No.," I see. You try the trick of ""no."" You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date."
3810, No., The 11th?
3811, No., The fifth?
3812, No., Tonight?
3813, No., This evening before dinner?
3814, I'm sorry. The answer is no., Go.
3815, Here is my story.," Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer."
3816, I hope so too., This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.
3817, Why?, I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.
3818, How dare you?, Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.
3819, It's true., It's so rude.
3820," No, it was me. And I meant it.", I would say Amanda.
3821, I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!, Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.
3822, You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?," Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, ""Folks, this may be good."" And this is not the only ""maybe good"". Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and ""It's good"" Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... ""It proves that you selected the eyes closed"" Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance."
3823, Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from g*ns N'Roses!, You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?
3824," And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?", Group Photo!
3825, False!," It was there, we know the end."
3826, And me too. He has how many hands?, Oh? So do I.
3827," Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.", Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.
3828," Nope, not at all.", It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.
3829," Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.", And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.
3830, You really put a knot!, They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.
3831, Of course.," A crisp, Barney?"
3832, You sure?, I! A photo ugly.
3833, It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God., No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?
3834, You sure?," It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected? Mouse, m*therf*cker! I!"
3835," The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.", Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!
3836, They would be if Marshall was not on it.," Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over."
3837, It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really., I think Lori's age made him very wise.
3838, What? Where?, It's a hole in your jacket?
3839, Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...," Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory."
3840, I love traveling., No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.
3841," Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.", Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?
3842," Ted, a blonde, it's easy.", You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.
3843," Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane."," Ted, a blonde, it's easy."
3844," So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space."," But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane."
3845," I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!", Why are you lying all the time?

3847," Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said ""Hands up! ""?", Did you get mugged?
3848, It was downright terrifying., It was downright terrifying.
3849, I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion., What are you doing?
3850, I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.," Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life."
3851," It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. """," Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?"
3852, So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!," I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said."
3853, I do not ask where he kept his weapon., He assaulted you naked?
3854, You're telling us..., It's good. It's good.
3855, You've been mugged by a monkey?, For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.
3856, Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?, This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.
3857, New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.," Hi, friends. What's new?"
3858," No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...", Okay. That's what happened.

3860," Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.", Was not... Was not banana banana.
3861, I've just been mugged., You've been mugged by a monkey.
3862, That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now..., What?
3863, It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life., That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...
3864," Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...", Neil? Neil!
3865," Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?", You've just mugged?
3866, And it was the best thing in my life 3., Me too.
3867," The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...", You're the lemon in your hair.
3868, So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?, Not at all.
3869," You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?"," Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n."
3870, I can not believe.," I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened."
3871, You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous., What?
3872," If serious, this is too funny.", I would not?

3875, I still say that it happened., I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.
3876," Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body."," Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible."
3877," False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!"," It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them."

3880," It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied."," Yes, Neil?"
3881," 31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!"," Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31."

3886, Now I want a weapon.," I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York."
3887, You know if it was attacked?, No! I have not been mugged!
3888, It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good., Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.
3889," Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way."," Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you."

3901," Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?"," I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move."
3902, The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.," Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done."

3904, Put rockets in..., Children? Why...
3905, Gamin., Bourre.
3906," You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me."," Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!"

3912," It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know."," But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both."
3913, Of course.," Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?"
3914, Shit., You're always a little too far.
3915, I see a complaint.," Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here."
3916, Thank you. My God.," You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?"
3917," OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.", Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.

3919," Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint."," Please, stop."
3920, I wanted to be your father!, What are you talking about?

3922, And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.," Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport."
3923, It is a good time. Not much traffic..., Here we go.
3924, Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...," Oh, I love this song."

3933," I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.", Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.
3934," In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin."," The'm not, it's as if we had never been together."
3935," Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.", I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.

4042, Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.," Well, there you got wrong."
4043," Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.", I think Robin...
4044, You kiss?, You forgot what looks like Barney?
4045," Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has ""forgotten"" to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.", It works!
4046, Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond., We must control our...
4047, That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter..., I had a job offer in Chicago.
4048, Not so great that., I told you so.
4049, Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!, Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.
4050," Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.", Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!
4051, This guy looks like me...," The friends, follow me!  Look! The fifth double."
4052, It's like looking in a mirror., Amazing.
4053," I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?"," Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers."
4054," Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?", A sun dress.
4055," Of course, of course.", I really have to get this done.
4056," ""Sun dress,"" by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...", Thank you.
4057, I want to see a pretty girl.," Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!"
4058," I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word."," Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once."
4059, Dibs!, And what's that word?
4060, You never called dibs., What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.
4061, Implied dibs?, Dibs were implied.
4062," Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...", Yeah.
4063, And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!," Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court."
4064, Where is Marshall anyway?, Damn it!
4065," Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this: When I step up to make my toast as your best man...", You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.
4066, As your best man...," Actually, Marshall would probably be..."
4067, Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs., As your best man...
4068, What?, No!
4069," Shhh, shh. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.",  I had no idea. You have to know that.
4070, We could just do it right here.," Or, you know, we could just do it right here."
4071," Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, ""Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny."" That is not what ""shields up"" looks like.  That is what ""shields up"" looks like.", Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.
4072," Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace."," Move. God!  Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?"
4073," Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.", No fries for this guy.
4074, With hygiene?," You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup."
4075," Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you."," No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs."
4076," This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a ""de-rection."""," Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? "
4077, Excuse me?," Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?"
4078, Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars., Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.
4079, But I... Can I go smell her first?, 20 bucks.
4080, Fine. , No. 
4081, What the hell are you doing?, Good.
4082," Oh, that sucks! And dibs.", That girl she's talking to? I dated her.
4083," Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous."," Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?"
4084," Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.", Jealous?
4085, You lost it., I have not lost it.
4086," Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here."," I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want."
4087," Yeah, she definitely saw you."," Hi, Ted!"
4088," Okay, will do. And dibs."," Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her."
4089," Oh, you don't want my opinion on that."," Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?"
4090," If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.", Why not?
4091," Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!", That was really...
4092," No. Lily, look.  You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.", Brief.
4093," Robin, you do look super hot."," 14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way."
4094," Yeah, you do."," Oh, do I?"
4095," Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!", Her words exactly.
4096, No. Good. That was pretty lame.," She didn't see us high-six, did she?"
4097," So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.", No! Of course! Absolutely!
4098, I don't want to talk about it., What's wrong?
4099," All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!", Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!
4100," Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up."," With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback."
4101, Of course not. It's a two-day job., You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?
4102," You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.", Unsubscribe.
4103," Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.", So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.
4104, How dare you!," Yeah, that's what your mom said."
4105, Bro!, James!
4106, Mom. Stop., Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.
4107, Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.," Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?"
4108," I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."," Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?"
4109," I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."," I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."
4110," Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.", That sounds plausible.
4111," Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this..."," Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better."
4112," ""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General."," Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this..."
4113, Thank you.," ""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General."
4114, Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?," Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others."
4115, Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...," No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early."
4116, Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class., I'm not lying to our kids.
4117," Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?"," Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron."
4118, Mom addressed this and never sent it., No idea. Why?
4119," Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""", What's in it?
4120," I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!", Can you believe her?
4121," Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker."," Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers."
4122," So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy."," This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?"
4123," ""Really rich""?"," No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""?"
4124," For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?", You ready for this?
4125," Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.", I thought you said that he... Stop.
4126," Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!"," Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today..."
4127," Here, Ted. Capture the moment!"," Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?"
4128," Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about."," I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl."
4129," Dad, look how fast I can run!"," She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear."
4130," Dad, you're not looking!", He's beautiful.
4131," Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?", Barney? I need to talk to you.
4132, Are you sure?," Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father."
4133," What'd Coach say, Ma?"," I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible."
4134, Why didn't anyone come?, He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.
4135," It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.", Barney.
4136, I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta., But it's your father.
4137, Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?," Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom."
4138," Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?"," But first, let's back up a few days."
4139," Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again."," Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy."
4140, Hi. Barney Stinson.," Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again."
4141, Thank you for your time.," And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman."
4142, Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!, Thank you for your time.
4143," Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase."," Back already. How was flying solo? And by ""solo,"" I mean so low that you got shot down."
4144," Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that s*x just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have s*x with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her."," Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?"
4145," No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?"," What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail."
4146," Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?"," Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart."
4147," Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.", Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...
4148, Of course not.," I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?"
4149, I need another drink.," I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important."
4150, Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.," So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?"
4151," Chrissy, I love your glasses."," Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?"
4152, They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy., Really?
4153," Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.", But Barney hasn't done...
4154," Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks!  Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!", Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?
4155," So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?", And the intense eye contact thing?
4156, That is so true., You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.
4157," Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?"," Barney, I gotta tell you something."
4158," Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.", Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.
4159," What? Ted, it's too late."," Okay, I'll do it!"
4160," Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...", I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.
4161, Dude!, What?
4162, You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here., You guys lied to me?
4163, We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.," Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me."
4164, 236.," No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women..."
4165," Come on, Ted! This is your dream."," No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me."
4166," Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.", Why aren't you in class?
4167, I cannot stop staring at that girl's face., I knew this day would come.
4168," No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.", Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.
4169," Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?", Aw... That's actually really sweet.
4170," Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?"," By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things."
4171, Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.," Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him."
4172," The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus."," Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5."
4173," You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first."," Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg."
4174," Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?", How?
4175," Oh, wow!"," Oh, my God!"
4176,  Stay sad! I'll be back!," All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! Doesn't matter how you get there!"
4177," Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.",  Stay sad! I'll be back!
4178, Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!, That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...
4179," Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.", This is my cab...!
4180," Oh, no.  It's Barney. Help me."," Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown."
4181," Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.", Hello.
4182," Hey, Ranjit, pull over."," Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. "
4183," Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.", Pulling over.
4184, I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?," So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?"
4185, Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.," Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?"
4186," Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say ""carrots and peas"". Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face."," Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing..."
4187," What, you really had something to talk about?"," Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say ""carrots and peas"". Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face."
4188," Robin, I had no idea."," Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me k*lled. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying."
4189," No, don't stop the car.", Stopping the car.
4190," Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.", Seriously stopping the car.
4191, Don't... You..., Carrots and peas.
4192, Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.," Oh, God. Oh, bite me!"
4193," And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.", Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.
4194," And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me."," Actually, Barney did not need a win."
4195, Stop! Too slow. Switch.,He did smell incredible.
4196, Who cares?, Where are Marshall and lily?
4197, No!, I won? I won!
4198, How did that even happen?, I can't believe I won!
4199, No!, I won!
4200," Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.", I know what you did back there.
4201, Smell me., I'm not gonna... Not gonna...
4202, Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!," I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch."
4203," Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building."," Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said..."
4204, Sure. What's up?," Barney, we have to talk."
4205," Not now, Trish!"," Excuse me, Mr. Stinson."
4206," Legendary! So, what's on your mind?"," ""Dary."""
4207, You're kidding me., Just don't!
4208, Snakes.," I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?"
4209," I don't recall saying ""snakes"". Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better."," Did you just say ""snakes""?"
4210, You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better., New is always better?
4211, Everything., Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?
4212, Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.," So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?"
4213," Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted."," And when you're at a g*ns n' Roses concert, you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy""?"
4214," A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!"," Your call, buddy."
4215, How can you speak of such things?, Max has a small pen1s.
4216, How can you speak of such things?," Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming..."
4217, I do not do that.," You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, ""Boobs?"" Not the complete sentence, ""Does she have big boobs?"" Which also would not be great. Just: ""Boobs?"""
4218, Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?, My friend Lori from work...
4219," Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.", Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.
4220," I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?", I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.
4221, Boobs?, What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.
4222, Whose dream?, She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!
4223," Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it."," That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tr*nny before, but it's still sweet."
4224, And you said...?," Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?"
4225," Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?", Where do I sign?
4226," And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?", This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.
4227, This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl., What? I panicked!
4228, Asian girls love them some Jews., Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.
4229," No. Technically, they were eggs."," The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?"
4230," I don't recall saying ""eggs."""," Did you just say ""eggs""?"
4231," Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!"," Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down."
4232, Momentary grudging respect.," Solid C-cup, perky bounce."
4233," Ted, that is never gonna happen."," Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building."
4234, Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door., How the hell could you do that?
4235," I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal."," The billboard, Barney."
4236," Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!", You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.
4237, Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.," Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!"
4238," You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.", You named the rabbit?
4239, So you're back in?, You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.
4240, You want the long version or the short version?," You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?"
4241, Short version. Who's your daddy?, Short version.
4242, Challenge accepted.," Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy."
4243," I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.", No.
4244," Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance."," Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance."
4245, That was my card!, Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!
4246," Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie.  Who's your daddy?"," Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend."
4247, I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,"  Yeah, I slept."
4248,  Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!, I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.
4249,"  I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited."," Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away, give it up for Marshall's daughter!"
4250,  I'm sorry.," No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge."
4251, Challenge accept...," Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing."
4252, Hey., Hey.
4253," No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all."," Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?"
4254," Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say ""Who's your daddy?"" to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged."," That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry."
4255," : Uh-oh, I'm in ""twubble.""",  Someone naughty left his toys on the floor and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.
4256," Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go.", You did it? How?
4257, No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.," Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some?"
4258," Challenge completed!  Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.", Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy?
4259," Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam."," It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys."
4260, I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.," Oh, no, thank you. I brew my own. At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic."
4261,  Looks like that bee got busy.," Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups."
4262, That's a line.," Come on, Marshall."
4263, Does it get any better than this?, We get it.
4264, There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.,
4265, Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. , My co-anchor's a woman.
4266, I care about our precious Earth.," What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care."
4267," All you have to do is say ""I care about making dreams come true."""," Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet."
4268, Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.," First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so."
4269, I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.," Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project."
4270," Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment."," Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out."
4271," See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.", That's...exactly what happened.
4272," Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy m*rder*d him."," Hey, guys."
4273," Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. ""We care about making dreams come true,"" in three, two..."," Oh, we'll see about that."
4274," I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.", I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.
4275," Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life."," Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine."
4276," Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?", That's just the pick-me-up I needed.
4277, Yep. That's a wrap., I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?
4278," Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?"," She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a ""fat cat."" Me and my ""fat-cat friends."" We're not fat cats."
4279," Ah, bully!"," Impeccable, old bean. To industry!"
4280," Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.", Ooh.
4281," I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers."""," Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?"
4282," So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.", Not bad.
4283, It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?," Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen."
4284, The Captain?, The Captain?
4285, Ahoy.," Well, ahoy."
4286, Challenge accepted.," Thank you, The Captain."
4287," Ah, that's the stuff.", I think I'm going to say yes.
4288, Impressive. Try this on for size.," I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles."
4289, I live for the dance., You want to dance? Let's dance.
4290," Sorry, sorry.", Get... your other hand... off my ass.
4291," This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing."," Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?"
4292, Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?, You're right.
4293, Niled it.," Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with."
4294, Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits., Excuse me.
4295," Oh, yeah, that story is legend...  Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?"," Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old."
4296, Thank you.," No. But I could, uh, check the files."
4297," Who's the master, Leroy?"," July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson."
4298," Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle."," Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker."
4299, Jerry's my uncle., Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.
4300," It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.", So when was the last time you saw him?
4301, He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away., Moms.
4302," But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad."," Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know..."
4303," I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?"," Barney, do you want...?"
4304, Thank you.," Oh, you're wearing a flower."
4305, I know. Isn't it?," Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed."
4306," Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.", Why does Barney do anything ever?
4307," Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie.", Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.
4308," Woman, you best check yourself."," Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for ""sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid"""""
4309, Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!," Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so..."
4310," No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!"," What, are we gonna duel?"
4311, I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!," Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now."
4312," No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about."," Oh, you haven't watched it yet?"
4313, Space Teens?! Is this a porno?," Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying."
4314," Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?"," I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p*rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success."
4315," Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily."," Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life."
4316," I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?", Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?
4317, The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat., Of course. Robin hates kids.
4318, Two dudes on the couch together watching p*rn? That's kind of weird., Just watch it without me.
4319, We...," Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off."
4320, It's a noble creature., The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.
4321, No arguments here.," Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!"
4322," Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.", I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.
4323," You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen."," Okay, yeah. I know."
4324, Where do I know this song from?," Me, too."
4325, Wow. This is so dirty., * Ice cream cone; We'll lick it side by side *
4326," What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?"," Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early."
4327,...To me.," Please stop. Okay, fine."
4328," And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed."," Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around."
4329, Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?," Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme."
4330," It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!"," Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said ""Grand Theft Auto"" can wait a night."
4331," Well, not anymore, Blitz."," I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years: The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch shots, sh**ting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all!"
4332," Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.", The oven.
4333," Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall."," Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?"
4334, Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.," Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard."
4335, Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!, I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.
4336," And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.", Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?
4337, No. I c... Because... Step on it.," But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?"
4338, But he's The Blitz.," Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang ""Twist and Shout!"""
4339," Oh, God, no!", Blitz...
4340, Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. : I'm scared.," Barney, could you get me some more ice?"
4341, Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this., You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.
4342, What happened?," Okay, I got to test this."
4343," Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!"," Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled."
4344," No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.", I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.
4345, I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!," Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz."
4346, Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!, What does that have to do with anything?
4347," Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.", Wait... Where's Barney?
4348," Aw, man! Wait. Which half?", Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.
4349, What happened? I saw it!, The Gentleman!
4350," Thank you, God!"," Oh, hold the door!"
4351," Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.", Okay. That man is terrifying.
4352," Captain, what do you think of rainy days?"," Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy.  But the top half of his face...wants to m*rder you! Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!"
4353, And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party., Holding the towel.
4354, Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.," Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one..."
4355, Lubricant is public property. , And the most important rule of all...
4356," Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?", Oh! Sweet. No candles.
4357," Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.", Barney.
4358," Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.", Watch out!
4359," So, who's the eye broccoli?"," Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB."
4360," Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs."," Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good."
4361," Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?", I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
4362," It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.", I'm sorry. Myth?
4363, D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.," And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually..."
4364, Let's say yes., Did we bet on this?
4365," What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!"," Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there."
4366, Nah. Watch out!, Want to hang?
4367," Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"," Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense."
4368," Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.", I asked Barney the same thing.
4369," Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.", Death?
4370," Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?"," Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant."
4371," High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee."," Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes."
4372," I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"," Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!"
4373," Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.", Oh... You're a jerk.
4374, Breast-feeding. Hot.,What's that?
4375, Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I., Really?
4376, I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!, What?!
4377," Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?", And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.
4378," Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n?  Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check.", Bon Jovi?
4379," And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit."," My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee."
4380," Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang."," Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?"
4381," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!", What?!
4382, Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!"
4383," Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight,  is Barney's Favorite Things!", we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.
4384," Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?", Huh? I don't know what that is.
4385, Velour track suits!, The next hour got pretty weird.
4386, Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club!  You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more., Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.
4387, I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club., No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.
4388," Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless..."," The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island."
4389, I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.," What's up, Barney?"
4390," No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail."," Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney."
4391," I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more."," What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe."
4392," Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero..."," Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews."
4393,"...Zero...  Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.", You're not pregnant.
4394," Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me."," That's great. Thank you, Barney!"
4395," Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born.  Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!", What happened to giving the money away?
4396," Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.", It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!
4397," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!", What?!
4398, What am I doing with my life?, What am I doing with my life?
4399, Get a puppy!," Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog."
4400, Oh. Our movie snack., No!
4401," I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!"," And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list."
4402, Nope., Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point?
4403, And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?, Positive.
4404," Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.", Yeah. Why?
4405, Son?!," Thank you, son."
4406," Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.", Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.
4407," Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight..."," Um, no."
4408," Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments."," Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head."
4409, And Marshall's the winner., Damn it.
4410," Yeah, and it cuts in and out.", So I understand you want to get pregnant.
4411," Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?", Ooh! How did you do it?
4412, What are you talking about?, What are you talking about?
4413, Not today I wasn't.," Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?"
4414, Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.," No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out."
4415," Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror."," No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?"
4416," How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!"," Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him."
4417," Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!", Thank you.
4418," Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!", I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.
4419, Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.," Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected s*x 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem."
4420," Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*ns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted."," Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid."
4421," I'll show you. ""Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion""."," But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation."
4422," ""Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome""."," Barney, I've already told..."
4423," Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation?"," Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?"
4424," Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!"," Count, motility... everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers."
4425," She said ""doody."""," ""Judy duty."""
4426," Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh."," Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy."
4427," Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?", How?
4428," Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.", Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.
4429," Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!", What about animals?
4430," Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh."," Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding!"
4431," See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...", Oh!
4432," This next clip is entitled, ""Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull""", This is worse than the pork chop.
4433, Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts., Let's see what happens.
4434, Fall off. Shorts just fall right off., And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.
4435," Exactly. All those ""famous last word"" people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?"," She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?"
4436, You know what his real last words were?, My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.
4437, True story., I'm peeing my pants!
4438, So?," Hey, stay hydrated."
4439, It doesn't. That's true.," We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said."
4440," Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called ""German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.""", Yes.
4441, And here's your phone number back.," Whoa, they grow big out here."
4442, Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.," Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once."
4443, What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts., Stupid.
4444, She's right. Your dad was hilarious.," Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?"
4445," Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad."," Hi, Dad."
4446, I hope I can pass this hot dog., Could someone pass the ketchup?
4447," Oh, honey."," Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself."
4448, Why do they call 'em coasters?," Wow, an architect. How fascinating."
4449," Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?"," Okay, time to go home."
4450," Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.", What are you talking about?
4451, It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?, What?
4452," Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.", Mm-hmm.
4453, Does anyone know why we're here?, Funny you should say that.
4454," Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch."," Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair."
4455," Hey, Marshall."," Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking."
4456," I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.", Barney. W- What number is this?
4457," Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story."," Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing."
4458," That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.", Uh... Robin's version was...
4459," Anyway, I get Honey back to her place."," Okay, time to go home."
4460, Who's your daddy?," Anyway, I get Honey back to her place."
4461," Sure, I'll just summarize it. "," Okay, can we skip this part, please?"
4462," Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey."," Okay, that's been going on a while."
4463," Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts."," Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey."
4464," Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...", Thanks.
4465," Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... "," Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?"
4466, She hugged me. What was that all about?," Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... "
4467, Who's your daddy?," Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy."
4468, So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me., I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.
4469," I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me."," Oh, honey."
4470," I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son."," Oh, honey."
4471, Four. Four Nobel Prizes.," Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees."
4472, Only three.," Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?"
4473,"  You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great."," My friends, as usual, were completely supportive."
4474,  Total booty-call.,  Oh. Translation: booty-call.
4475,"  Wow, you sound really lonely.", Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.
4476,"  Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day."," I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears..."
4477,"  It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",  That's not a thing.
4478,"  Wait, there's more.", That's actually true.
4479,"  And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.", This won't be.
4480,"  Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.", And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.
4481,"  Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.","  Please say ""widows."""
4482,  Trolls.,"  Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work..."
4483,  Lying trolls., ...who could care less about Valentine's Day.
4484," You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?", I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.
4485,"  We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, ""Bring a carry-on.""", You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.
4486,"  God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted."," Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night..."
4487,"  EnchantÃ©. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""","  Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex."
4488,"  Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancÃ©"" who no one's ever met.","  And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday."
4489,"  Okay, when your ""fiancÃ©"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.", No!
4490,  My elbow slipped!,"  Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?"
4491,"  So, you were an Olympic gymnast?", Please come home soon.
4492,"  Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.", Silver medal.
4493,"  And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.", That's what my dad said.
4494,  Quick question.," Oh, hi."
4495,  Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?, Yeah.
4496,  Sure.," Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?"
4497,"  Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?", I love Valentine's Day.
4498,"  Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?"," Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?"
4499,  The worst., We are pitiful.
4500,  What's that?, Although there is one difference between you and me.
4501,"  All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate."," Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything."
4502,"  Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie."," What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?"
4503,  Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.," Hey, I'm all stretched out!"
4504, ...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.," Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter."
4505,"  Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.", Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!
4506,"  I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news."," Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair."
4507,"  What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!"," Well, I think I'm heading out, too."
4508,  What are you talking about?,  Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...
4509,"  No, I don't. She's gross.","  Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora."
4510,  Whatever you say.,  Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.
4511,  Nora...,"  Oh, hey, Nora."
4512,"  The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!"," Well, that was kind of presumptuous."
4513,  Hap...?,"  Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day."
4514,  Oh!," And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day."
4515, I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.," So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag."
4516, You want to grab a drink right now?," Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to."
4517, Absolutely.," No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call."
4518," She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...", How is that a disaster?
4519, You want to grab a drink right now?," She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well..."
4520, Absolutely.," No, I'm kind of tired."
4521," It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.", Absolutely.
4522," What? Nora? No, I don't."," Please, Cheese. You like this girl."
4523," That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?"," Barney, you can't say her name without smiling."
4524," Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.", You like her. You should call her.
4525, Totally.," That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice."
4526, Like Prince.," Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man."
4527, Oh. Ha-wink," No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore."
4528," Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.", Excuse me?
4529," Five weeks, three days by my estimation.", It's been a while.
4530, I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds., You should work at a carnival.
4531, 18 weeks.," Good night. Good night, guys."
4532," Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one."," Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and..."
4533, We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way., Throw me one? Yeah.
4534, Yeah?," Oh, I see what's going on."
4535," Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?"," This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care."
4536, What?, Nora met a guy. What?!
4537," But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!", Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.
4538," Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.", You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.
4539," You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.", Lily!
4540," Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.", Sorry. Who said anything about an...?
4541," No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!"," No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten."
4542," No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility."," You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship."
4543, Sorry?," Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one."
4544," Careful, Robin, I'll do it."," I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve."
4545," Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back."," Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place."
4546," All right, Robin, give it to me.", I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.
4547," The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?"," Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you."
4548, A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?," It's a five, idiot."
4549, How am I supposed to see that's a five?," ""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?"
4550," Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.", Look how you taped this up...
4551," I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.", Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.
4552," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora."," You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge."
4553," Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule..."," Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl."
4554," If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]", Barney said this a lot.
4555, Never go out with the same girl more than once.," If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]"
4556, There is an exception., Then why are you going out with Nora again?
4557,...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot., And it was always the same exception.
4558," And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. ",...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.
4559," Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold."," And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. "
4560, About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.," Oh, no. How long have you been sick?"
4561, Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?," Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little..."
4562, The bed... that's where all the...happens.," Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime."
4563, Ah. Thank you.," That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney."
4564," Good night, Mommy."," Good night, Barney."
4565, No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.," Wow, she nursed you back to health?"
4566," Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.", Should have just let you get a dog.
4567, No.," Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?"
4568, Yes!, Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?
4569," Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *"," Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special."
4570," * Bang, bang, bangity bang... *"," Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *"
4571," * A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *", Are we done?
4572," See, Lily? She was worried."," Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine."
4573," Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight."," It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours."
4574," Well, now it doesn't.", Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.
4575," Go on, Doctor."," Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about."
4576," Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.", What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?
4577," This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing."," This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest?"
4578, What's that like?," Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night."
4579," My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.", So is everything okay?
4580, Thanks.," Oh, I am so sorry."
4581," Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?"," Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it."
4582," That's exactly what I want, too.", You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!
4583," Hey, guys, this is Nora.", I'll get 'em.
4584," I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids."," Oh, you should have heard him at dinner."
4585, Three... one of each. You?, How many do you want?
4586," Yeah, with ivy growing on it.", Three. All in an old stone house.
4587, And we must have a pool.," Yeah, with ivy growing on it."
4588, I really am.," We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?"
4589," I assure you, that's not a nickname that I..."," I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here."
4590," I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious."," Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie."
4591," Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it."," Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend."
4592," Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?"," Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora."
4593, Marshall?," Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice."
4594, The calzone?, You got nothing on me.
4595, Robin., Checkmate.
4596, The Mr. T dream...,"  Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream..."
4597, Ted?, I'm lost.
4598, The ballet class., Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.
4599, The 'N Sync concert., I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.
4600," Okay, Ted. The thermos."," 1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?"
4601, I do! So be cool!, I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.
4602, Thermos., Once?
4603," I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.", This was a big deal for Barney.
4604, Not even if her mom's hot., Not even if she's hot?
4605, I'd love to meet your parents., Not even if her mom's hot.
4606," No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!", Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.
4607," Yeah, me, too.", Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.
4608," I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.", Do you want to come upstairs?
4609, Can you believe...," I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants."
4610," Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.", Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?
4611, I was on the spot. This is your fault., Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!
4612," Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.", My fault?
4613," Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?","  Hey, have you seen Scooby?"
4614," Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.", Day's not over.
4615," Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But..."," No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do."
4616, Last night? 8:30., What time was your dinner reservation?
4617, I lied.," Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it."
4618," When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.", Barney.
4619," So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.", I'm confused.
4620," Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"," Mom, Dad... this is Barney."
4621," Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad..."," Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids."
4622," Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",  We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.
4623," Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks."," Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?"
4624," Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",  You call the super for a screwdriver?
4625," Well, here's our screwdriver now.  Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself."," Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools."
4626, Dad?," Barney, I... I got your letter."
4627, Where do I begin?," Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?"
4628, Yeah. I think I need a drink.," So, I'm not sure how to start this."
4629," Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.", Nice order. Up top.
4630," I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now."," Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?"
4631, Make a muscle.," I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now."
4632, Ah!, There you go.
4633," Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.", Ah!
4634," Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?"," Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out."
4635," So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.", You're funny. My dad's funny.
4636, Do you... get laid a lot?," You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?"
4637," Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.", Big-time. Observe.
4638, You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...," Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks."
4639,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.", You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...
4640," Oh, that's cool.", So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.
4641, This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. ," Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?"
4642, What do you mean?,"  Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful."
4643," First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready."," Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt."
4644, I'm not sure how to start this., That's not what happened.
4645, I think I need a drink., Yeah.
4646," Glen McKenna, neat."," Me, too."
4647," Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?"," Milk, skim."
4648, Wow.," I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night."
4649," Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?"," I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30."
4650," Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass."," No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right"
4651," Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff."," Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier."
4652," Yes, yes, yes."," The drugs, the alcohol, the women..."
4653, *Out of control.*, I was out of control.
4654, You ever bang Stevie Nicks?," So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry."
4655, Big-time.," What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player."
4656," Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son."""," Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate."
4657, Why?," Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that."
4658," You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this."," I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them."
4659, What?,  We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.
4660," No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.", You're having dinner with him tonight.
4661," Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.", Are you sure it's not more than that?
4662," Fine, I'll go."," No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road."
4663," Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.", Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.
4664," Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair."," Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you."
4665," It ages well, that's the thing."," Hey, Lily,  Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie."
4666, I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.," J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top."
4667," J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God."," Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you."
4668," Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?"," So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank."
4669," Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.", I'm 11.
4670," Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?", I got a paper route.
4671," Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?", J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.
4672," Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!", Fourth period?
4673, Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?," Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough."
4674, Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me., J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.
4675, This is mine.," Barney, what is going on?"
4676," J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.", I don't understand.
4677," Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad."," Please, just come down and talk to me."
4678," Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!", Why does that make you so mad?
4679," Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe..."," Look, Barney, I know I screwed up..."
4680, Can you help me with this?," I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin."
4681, Bye.," Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life."
4682," I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",  Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
4683," You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?"," Yeah, buddy."
4684," No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop."," Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine."
4685," Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner."," But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work."
4686, Quit GNB?! Why?, I have to quit.
4687," Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes."," I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species..."
4688," Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids."," Baby, you have my full support."
4689," Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",I don't think you know what Spain is.
4690, Where? I want his autograph!, It's dinero.
4691," Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. : He was a good boy.
4692," No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!"," You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB."
4693," It starts with an... ""L?""", I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.
4694, And I said my name was...?, It rhymes with your name.
4695," It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything."," Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?"""
4696, I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.," Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC."
4697," What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.", Hershel?
4698, There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?," Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker."
4699, Just come back to GNB already!," Barney, I'm not playing..."
4700, That's how I'm gonna use mine.," Thanks, baby.  Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper."
4701," Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.", Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?
4702," Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this!","Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?"
4703," Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?"," Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go."
4704," Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time."," Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't."
4705, How long have you been there?,"  Oh, my God!"
4706," Oh, no, I'm fine."," Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day."
4707,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?"," Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?"
4708,"Right. So, um... Chinese?", Yeah.
4709, There's nothing to talk about.," My bag? Oh, no. I got it."
4710," I don't want to talk about it, okay?"," You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad."
4711, Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything., Why not?
4712, That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?," I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... : ticking."
4713, Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.," No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts."
4714, It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day., Huh?
4715," Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.", It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.
4716," I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then..."," Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there."
4717,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?"," I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then..."
4718, Eat this meatball sub.," Yes, of course, of course... anything."
4719, I don't have much time!, Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...
4720," What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?"," Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz k*ll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you."
4721, But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.," But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you."
4722, A drunk audience.," Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?"
4723, Bye., This time it was Barney who did the walking.
4724," I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess."," And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later..."
4725, My dad!, Mmm. Your dad?
4726, Barney Stinson., My dad!
4727," Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years."," Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?"
4728, You do not know how right you are.," Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?"
4729, Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything., You do not know how right you are.
4730," I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues."," You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year."
4731,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?"," Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs."
4732," Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.","Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?"
4733,No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards., That's why you brought these guys.
4734,Yeah., Improvements?!
4735,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage."," Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards."
4736,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.", Gross!
4737,"Ted, card."," Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks..."""
4738,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted."," Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde."""
4739," I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks."," Aw, man! Why?"
4740, And... hence new identities., How good was that movie?
4741," Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.", And so Barney's dad finally showed up.
4742," Lily, his wife."," Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet."
4743," Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.", Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.
4744," Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong..."," So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?"
4745," Oh, no."," Um, those places shut down a long time ago."
4746," No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?"," Where's where Was was, isn't it?"
4747," Guys, focus.", That's wrong. That's not Wrong.
4748," No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.", I thought Focus was closed.
4749," No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore."," Guys, shut up."
4750," It's hopeless, isn't it?"," For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced LamÃ©."
4751, I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!, Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.
4752," Man, isn't this place great?", You owe me one.
4753," Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.", And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.
4754, Let's do shots., What?
4755," No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? ""Never stop partying."""," Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy."
4756," You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?", I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.
4757," Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.", But I want to hang out with you.
4758, Can you believe it? This is awesome!," Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!"
4759, I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.," Barney, how is that awesome?"
4760," Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?", So our usual wager. Deal.
4761," No, of course not. I... I just..."," Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?"
4762," Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!"," Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!"
4763," : Hey, hey! There we go!"," You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!"
4764, Oh...!," Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!"
4765," It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special..."," Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry."
4766, What?," Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!"
4767, But all those crazy things you did.," Bottoms up, amigo!"
4768, A drunk audience., Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?
4769," No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!"," You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!"
4770, Oh...!, Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!
4771, What just happened?, Oh...!
4772," Well, why do all those things?", I... I just puked on the hood of that... ...police car.
4773, You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!," I figured if I showed you what... ""never stop partying"" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well."
4774," Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.", I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.
4775," Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too.  Abracadabra!", Perhaps.
4776, We need someplace to hide.," Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?"
4777," No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.", Where?
4778, Step on it! Jerry...," Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city."
4779," Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.", Do not step on it.
4780, This is no time for laws!, The laws are there to protect...
4781, I am not going to buckle up!," Buckle up, Barney."
4782, How did you do it?, And her fiancÃ©? The guy's like a two.
4783," How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...", Do what?
4784," Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...", You're drifting.
4785," When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken."," No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney."
4786,So how do you do it?," Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life."
4787,Maybe I've met her already., A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.
4788,Maybe some other time.," And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat."
4789,I'm going fishing with my dad.," Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years."
4790, This... sucks.,I'm going fishing with my dad.
4791," Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote."," If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you."
4792," Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples..."," Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down."
4793," Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?"," Dude, that's my girlfriend."
4794," Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend."," Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down."
4795," Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?"," Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?"
4796, I mean this is really like..., That was on purpose!
4797, No. I' was... I was..., Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!
4798," Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. ", Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.
4799, Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?," Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory."
4800, Kent! Kent!, That's it!
4801," That's what you get, you traitor!"," Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!"
4802, Yeah. Really.," Oh, really? Really?"
4803," I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that."," Ten, nine, eight..."
4804," Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm..."," The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth."
4805, Show me chicken wings!," Hey, where are our chicken wings?"
4806, Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?, I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.
4807," What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?", Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?
4808," Oh, my God.", I showed up with wet hair once! Once!
4809," Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that..."," See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me."
4810," It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?"""," Oh God, I didn't even think of that..."
4811, That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.," Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney."
4812, Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm., What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?
4813, I love you., I love you.
4814," Uh, no. N-Not right...", I love you.
4815, You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?, Morning. Who wants breakfast?
4816," I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...", I love you.
4817," What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?", We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.
4818," Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted..."," Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too."
4819," Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?", And she hasn't since.
4820," Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?", Nailed it.
4821, I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.," It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands."
4822," Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...", What?
4823, I once knew such a girl.," I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross."
4824, It was last call. In this very bar., I once knew such a girl.
4825, What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!, It was last call. In this very bar.
4826, Come on. This is so about the girl.," Barney, this is about the building."
4827," Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be.  That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now."," Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry."
4828," Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?"," Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard."
4829, Isn't that animal cruelty?," No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement."
4830," Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?", I'm talking about my wife.
4831," So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you?  Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah..."," Yeah, I know your friend Ted."
4832, Come again for Big Fudge?," No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you."
4833," Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.", Come again for Big Fudge?
4834, I don't understand. Why would you fire me?, I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?
4835, By being the best architect available?, Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?
4836, By... being Latino?, No.
4837," Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.", No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.
4838, Damn it! I was kidding?," Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me."
4839," I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?", Damn it! I was kidding?
4840," We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.", Yeah.
4841, We should totally buy a bar!, What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.
4842," The only court where you show up, then get served.", I'll allow it!
4843," Oh, this ought to be good."," I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen.  And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?"
4844," Oh, this is good!", And then Lily told us her plan.
4845," Hey, Arthur!"," What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!"
4846," Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian."," No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!"
4847," Uh... Hey, Arthur?"," Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!"
4848," I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet.  I hope I used the right screws."," Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey."
4849, I want to press it!, I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!
4850, I want to press it!, I want to press it!
4851," You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?"," Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time."
4852, I want to press the button!, I'm not letting you press the button.
4853, Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!," Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?"
4854," Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?"," 50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?"
4855, Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better., There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?
4856," Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.", You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.
4857," Oh, hey, buddy."," Hi, Marsh."
4858, I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now., I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.
4859," I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!", I bet it's her tushie.
4860," I got you this job, so I... Say what?"," Yeah, fine, okay."
4861, You..., Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. 
4862, Who's that from?," Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour."""
4863, Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great., Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!
4864," No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs."," After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back."
4865," Ted, I only have one rule.", Bro.
4866, We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?, Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?
4867," Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey."," Okay, Zoey wrote, ""Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection."""
4868, You weren't listening either?," Aw, that's sweet."
4869, That's the intersection., Got it. Ted's at...  Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.
4870, Way ahead of ya., That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?
4871, I know. They're a total train wreck., I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.
4872," Yeah, almost as bad as us.", Worst couple ever.
4873," What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra."," We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched."
4874," Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?", You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.
4875, What do you mean?, I guess I get it.
4876," Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?"," Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?"
4877, Maybe this isn't the intersection.," Okay, where the hell are they?"
4878, She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?," Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?"
4879," Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid."," Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?"
4880, But... it's a mistake.," Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting."
4881, He is.," Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors?"
4882, Yeah. You earned it., You sure?
4883, Always.," Hey, new is always better, right?"
4884," It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please?  Norah.", I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.
4885, How you been?, Hi.
4886," Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.", Fine.
4887," I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.", I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.
4888, Challenge accepted.," It's never too late, Barney."
4889, What do you think of this tie?," Geez, what now?  I heard the groom needed me."
4890, What do you think of this tie?, What do you think of this tie?
4891, This one is better?," Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?"
4892," I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?"," The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage."
4893, I do not really talk about the tie.," Yeah, sure."
4894, I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?," Yeah, I realized that Barney."
4895, That of Punchy., Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.
4896," Yeah, no problem, of course.", Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?
4897, Woow., Ok
4898," Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland."," Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast."
4899," Here's your speech. ""In single file, girls. No big. """, This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.
4900," Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. ""In single file, girls. """, This is ridiculous.
4901, I'll call you.," Children, you remember Nora. But the other day..."
4902, I did not call., Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?
4903," I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings."," Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy."
4904," Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.", So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.
4905, What?, You're going to try to make you anybody here?
4906," It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%..."," My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect."
4907,"... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?", 17. He always reverse.
4908, We'll never know unless I try tonight.," No, no."
4909," Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero."," During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings."
4910," Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you?  Sea..."," You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type."
4911," Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that."," Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos."
4912," It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?", Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?
4913," I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes."," Well. Barney, just to make things clear..."
4914," Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.", Barney... I...
4915," I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair."," Wait, you said you'd never recalled."
4916, Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling..., Yeah.
4917, To tell you how I feel., To tell you how I feel.
4918, I know it did not work the first time..., I know it did not work the first time...
4919,... and it makes no sense...,... and it makes no sense...
4920,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
4921, Is there a part of you that wants to try again?, Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
4922," I chose the right tie, huh?"," No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?"
4923," You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?", This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.
4924, Between.," Oh, I'll cry too."
4925," Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?", What happened to your leg?
4926, A one-man show... I love it!, Lose the cast.
4927," You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon.

5317, Oh yes it can., Totally.
5318," Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome.

5363, What?!," Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya."
5364," Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?", What?!
5365, What? She needs to get psyched. Fine., Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.

5386," Give it a rest, Ted."," Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time."
5387," Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year."," Give it a rest, Ted."

5391, Cheers. Well said., Come on!
5392," Here, you need a mint."," I made it, baby."
5393," Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah."," When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist."
5394," You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.", Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?
5395," Ted, it's a simile."," You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date."
5396," Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you."," Yeah, do you need a drink or something?"
5397," What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way."," On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact."
5398, What?," This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up."
5399, What up?," You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes."
5400," Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years."," Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together."
5401," Invigorating, thanks."," Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership."
5402," But to be fair, she's also hot.", Don't make me hurt you Ted.
5403," Yeah, right."," But to be fair, she's also hot."
5404," Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?"," Yeah, right."
5405," Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move..."," Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?"
5406," A little Barney. And you know what he said?  ""Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."""," Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move..."
5407," Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up."," She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000."
5408," Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.", Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.
5409," Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?"," Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries."
5410,  They all drink vodka cranberries., You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.
5411," So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?"," Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?"
5412," No, but I do have a hug."," So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?"
5413,  Thank you.," You got $400,000?"
5414," That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please."," I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry."
5415," Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."," You know I don't have $400,000, right?"
5416," Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle."," Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."
5417, Oww," Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle."
5418," Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.", Oww
5419," All right, all right."," Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes."
5420," Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.", I love you.
5421, Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.," Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen."
5422," Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids."," What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see."
5423, Being single's the best., I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.
5424, Answer to no one., Being single's the best.
5425, Never having to go to a farmer's market., Answer to no one.
5426," OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...", The whole world full of endless possibilities.
5427," Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is."""," And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy."
5428," Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that."," Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is."""
5429," Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted."," Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian."
5430," This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?"," Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?"
5431, Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.," This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?"

5437, But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.," OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing."
5438, Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial., But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.
5439,"  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.", I'm ready to be proven wrong.

5442, Oh come on.,"  Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing."
5443,  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them., Hold this.
5444," Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.", Whoa. There she goes.
5445," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x."," Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?"
5446, I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately., I have no idea.
5447," Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes?

5453," Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow."""," Hell, yeah."

5455, You can't just... Wow!, It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.

The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin."," Man, that guy is a total, well... "

9276, I know. Isn't it?, Thank you.
9277," Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.", Why are you wearing that?
9278," Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie."," And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car."

9288, The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat., Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.

9292, No arguments here.," Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math.

While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?"
