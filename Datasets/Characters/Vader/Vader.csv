"Commander, tear this ship apartuntil you've found those plans andbring me the Ambassador. I want heralive!",If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?,We intercepted no transmissions.Aaah... This is a consular ship.Were on a diplomatic mission.
"Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.

You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!,I don't know what you're talking about.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.,"And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!",The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

Commence primary ignition.,No!,You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
I told you she would neverconsciously betray the Rebellion.,She lied! She lied to us!,"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
They must be trying to return thestolen plans to the princess. Shemay yet be of some use to us.,,Yes.
