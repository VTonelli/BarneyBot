"Leonard, I dont think I can do this.","Oh, take your time. Ill just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.",Thank-you. Well be right back.
"No. We are committing genetic fraud. Theres no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.","What, are you kidding? Youre a semi-pro.","Leonard, I dont think I can do this."

I wouldnt.,Im sure shell still love him.,"I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but theres some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesnt know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
I want to leave.,"Well, what do you want to do?",I wouldnt.
Whats the protocol for leaving?,Okay.,I want to leave.
Lets try just walking out.,"I dont know, Ive never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.",Whats the protocol for leaving?
Bye-bye,Bye.,Okay.
Are you still mad about the sperm bank?,See you.,Bye-bye
You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?,No.,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.",Not really.,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
"No, its true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.",I dont care. Two millimetres? That doesnt seem right.,"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
"No, that was the result of my work with lasers.",Is that why they sent you to boarding school?,"No, its true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
Evidently.,New neighbour?,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
"Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.",Significant improvement over the old neighbour.,Evidently.

No. Were going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.,Should we have invited her for lunch?,Bye.
Not with commentary.,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.,No. Were going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.",Not with commentary.
I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.",We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
Thats the beauty of it.,"Yes, and youve never met one of them.",I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Chat? We dont chat. At least not offline.,Im going to invite her over. Well have a nice meal and chat.,Thats the beauty of it.

Hi.,Hi.,Hi. Again.
"Leonard, Im not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.","Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when Im undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect.

"Well, today we tried masturbating for money.","So, what do you guys do for fun around here?",Great.
Actually thats my work.,"This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?",Youre very welcome.
"Yeah, well, its just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, thats just a joke, its a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.",Wow.,Actually thats my work.
Yeah.,"So youre like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.","Yeah, well, its just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, thats just a joke, its a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."

Whats the difference?,Whats the difference?,"No, I sit there."
"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration.

Fine.,Just sit somewhere else.,Well.
Aaah!,"Sheldon, sit!",Fine.
Thats not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.,Well this is nice. We dont have a lot of company over.,Aaah!
Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.,"Yes I now, but",Thats not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
I resent you saying we dont have company.,"Yes, I remember.",Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
That is an antisocial implication.,Im sorry.,I resent you saying we dont have company.
"Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Suns apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.","Um, me, okay, Im Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.","Yeah, its like regular boggle but, in Klingon. Thats probably enough about us, tell us about you."
Thats interesting. Leonard cant process corn.,"Oh, yeah, a lot of people think Im a water sign. Okay, lets see, what else, oh, Im a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.","I think what Sheldons trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldnt have been our first guess."
Youre lactose intolerant.,"Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.","Oh, yeah, Im a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."

It took you four years to get through High School?,"Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, thats like as long as High School.",I dont know.
"You? No, youll only make it worse.",Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.,"I just, I cant believe I trusted him."
Yes.,"You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?","You? No, youll only make it worse."
Yes.,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?,Our shower works.
No?,No.,Yes.
No.,No.,No?
Well this is an interesting development.,Thanks. You guys are really sweet.,Its right down the hall.
It has been some time since weve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.,How so?,Well this is an interesting development.
Point taken. It has been some time since weve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didnt want to rip our eyes out.,"Thats not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimers had that episode.",It has been some time since weve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?",The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.,Point taken. It has been some time since weve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didnt want to rip our eyes out.
That woman in theres not going to have sex with you.,Excuse me?,"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
"Oh, good. Then you wont be disappointed.",Well Im not trying to have sex with her.,That woman in theres not going to have sex with you.
"Yes, but not of the same species.","What makes you think she wouldnt have sex with me, Im a male and shes a female?","Oh, good. Then you wont be disappointed."
"Oh, of course.","Im not going to engage in hypotheticals here, Im just trying to be a good neighbour.","Yes, but not of the same species."
Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?,Thats not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldnt participate. However briefly.,"Oh, of course."
Leonard has a lady over.,Its just not a good time.,Why?
Technically that would be coitus interruptus.,Can we please stop saying coitus?,So shes available for coitus?
I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.,Wow.,Its just not the kind of thing you ask a guy youve just met.
"Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned womans ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?",Must we?,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.","She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.","Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned womans ex-boyfriend.

You think with your penis.,Which is?,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
"Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why cant she get her own TV.",Thats a biological impossibility and you didnt have to come.,You think with your penis.
No I dont. And neither do you.,"Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.","Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why cant she get her own TV."
"You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.","Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.",No I dont. And neither do you.
So we get to have a scene with him?,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. Theres some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.,"You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea."
"Leonard, the two of us cant even carry a TV.","No, Sheldon, theres not going to be a scene. Theres two of us and one of him.",So we get to have a scene with him?
Hello.,"Hi, Im Leonard, this is Sheldon.",Yeah.
"Okay, thanks for your time.",Get lost.,"What did I just. Uh, were here to pick up Pennys TV."
"Leonard, the TV is in the building, weve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",Were not going to give up just like that.,"Okay, thanks for your time."
My apologies. Whats your plan.,"Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.","Leonard, the TV is in the building, weve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
Its just a privilege to watch your mind at work.,My apologies. Whats your plan.,"Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
What do you think their combined IQ is?,"Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",Its just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
"Good thinking, Ill just be the muscle.",This is it.  Ill do the talking.,Just grab the door.
From the intercom.,"Im Leonard, this is Sheldon.",Yeah?
Tell him about our IQ.,Oh. Were scientists.,How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard.,Tell him about our IQ.,Oh. Were scientists.
My mom bought me those pants.,What?,Leonard.
Youre going to have to call her.,Im sorry.,My mom bought me those pants.
"Its okay. It wasnt my first pantsing, and it wont be my last.","Sheldon, Im so sorry I dragged you through this.",Youre going to have to call her.
Well you got me out of my pants.,"And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.","Its okay. It wasnt my first pantsing, and it wont be my last."
"Dont think like that, youre not going to die alone.","Anyway, Ive learned my lesson. Shes out of my league, Im done with her, Ive got my work, one day Ill win the Nobel Prize and then Ill die alone.",Well you got me out of my pants.
And youre certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.,"Thank you Sheldon, youre a good friend.","Dont think like that, youre not going to die alone."
That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?,"No, it was a valid hypothesis.","Im so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldnt be such an ass."
"Thank you. Youre not done with her, are you?",Really? Great.,"Really, thank you so much for going and trying youre, uh, youre so terrific. Why dont you put some clothes on, Ill get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
Not to mention imaginary.,Our babies will be smart and beautiful.,"Thank you. Youre not done with her, are you?"
"We cant have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.",Sure.,Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
Theyre both curry based cuisines.,So?,"We cant have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch."
They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see were going to have to spell out everything for this girl.,So?,Theyre both curry based cuisines.
"I dont know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, youre a veritable Mack Daddy.","Baby, baby dont get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby dont get hooked on me.",That sounds like fun.
"Since its not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.","Uh, Im not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.",But does it have peanut oil?
"You dont need chopsticks, this is Thai food.",Are there any chopsticks?,"Since its not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
"Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they dont actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.",Here we go.,"You dont need chopsticks, this is Thai food."
"Youre not swelling, Howard.",No.,Am I interrupting.
Hi.,"Yeah, I probably wont, but Hey Sheldon.",Get used to it.
"Dont take it personally, its his pathology, he cant talk to women.","Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?",Hi.
"Youre kidding, right?","A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?","Um, if you dont have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?"
One. .,"Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?","Youre kidding, right?"
You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.,One. .,"Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?"
"Oh no, lets assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.","Yes, I know, men cant fly.",You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
"In what space, sir, in what space? Shes two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, hed let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.","Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.","Oh no, lets assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces."
"Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Supermans flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earths yellow Sun.","Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Supermans flight is a feat of strength.","In what space, sir, in what space? Shes two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, hed let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death."
"Uh, a combination of the moons solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.","Yeah, and you dont have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.","Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Supermans flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earths yellow Sun."
Challenge accepted.  Were locked out.,"I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.",Im just going to go wash up.
I hardly think so.,"Okay, her apartments on the fourth floor but the elevators broken so youre going to have to  oh, youre just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess well just bring it up ourselves.","Also, the pretty girl left."
"Well, we dont have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.",Why not?,I hardly think so.
Archimedes would be so proud.,"We dont need strength, were physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, its just a matter  I dont have this I dont have this I dont have this.","Well, we dont have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
"Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.",Do you have any ideas?,Archimedes would be so proud.
Exactly half.,"Easy, easy  Okay! Now weve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.","Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
Whats your formula for the corner.,"Exactly half. Lets push. Okay, see, its moving, this is easy, all in the math.",Exactly half.
"Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.","What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.",Whats your formula for the corner.
You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?,"Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.","What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
"Yeah, those are men who just had sex.",Men do things for women without expecting sex.,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?

The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?,I dont know. Olivia Geiger?,Like who?
"Well, I dont think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.",Yeah.,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
"That depends. When I learn that Im a robot, will I be able to handle it?","Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didnt, would you want me to tell you?",None at all?
"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that Im a robot, would I be bound by Asimovs three laws of robotics?","Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.","That depends. When I learn that Im a robot, will I be able to handle it?"
Of course not.,"Thats true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?",You might be bound by them right now.
"Well, no.","Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?",Of course not.

"Oh, Ive seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I dont know if I can take it.","Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didnt move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.","So, how did it go with Lesley?"
"Oh, good lord.","I think Mrs Tishmans got her eye on you. Ive been there, youre in for a treat.","Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven."
"If youre compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.","You dont know me, you dont wear my chains God, thats a good song.","Oh, good lord."
"Leonard, listen to me","I know what youre thinking, Ive taken your asthma into account. Theres a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.","If youre compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you."
"Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?","Ive been thinking about names, Im kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.","Leonard, listen to me"
"Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.","Maybe, if its a cute little cuddly cat.","Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
"Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.","It doesnt matter. The womans not interested in me, the woman rejected me.","Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny."
"No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, dont buy a cat.","Youre right. I didnt ask her out, I should ask her out.","Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.

"Oh, goody, were getting a cat.","No, but youre right. I should march over there and ask her out.","No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, dont buy a cat."
Could you be more specific?,How do I look?,"To carve the okay, Ill see you six thirty."
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?,Can you tell Im perspiring a little?,Could you be more specific?
"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.",Six thirty.,No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
Not if youre a rugby team.,Is it too much?,"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate."
Why would I join you?,"By the way, if it should ever come up, you didnt join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.",Not if youre a rugby team.
"Oh, no, no, no, well now, theres always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.","No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isnt such a good idea.",Why would I join you?
"Of course, theres the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.","Youre right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.","Oh, no, no, no, well now, theres always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
"If I could of, I would of.",You could have stopped at it could go well.,"Of course, theres the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
Is the sex starting now?,"I mean, Im a perfectly nice guy. Theres no reason we couldnt go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, you love pottery? I love pottery!

"Oh, okay, well then, calm down.",Im having a panic attack.,Is the sex starting now?
"Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.","If I could calm down I wouldnt be having a panic attack, thats why they call it a panic attack.","Oh, okay, well then, calm down."
Just do it.,Why?,"Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.,Okay.,Just do it.
"Its a bio-feedback technique, its relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.",What?,Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
Me?,"Oh, who am I kidding, I cant go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.","Its a bio-feedback technique, its relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere."
What should I tell her.,Yes.,Me?
Okay.,I dont know. Tell her Im sick.,What should I tell her.
Got it. So Im assuming nothing venereal. Ill just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and havent quite bounced back.,"Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that shell feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.",Okay.
But I thought you wanted to cancel?,Give me the phone.,Got it. So Im assuming nothing venereal. Ill just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and havent quite bounced back.
Why would she be expecting me?,I cant because if I dont show up shell still be expecting you.,But I thought you wanted to cancel?
"So, how was your date?","When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows shes been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, Im going to go lay down for a while, good night.","Okay, I was just checking."
Score one for liquor and poor judgement.,Awesome!,"So, how was your date?"
Ive been thinking about time travel again.,Bill Prady  Steven Molaro,Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, Id just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.","Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?",Ive been thinking about time travel again.
"Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.",Interesting.,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, Id just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
"Its time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.","Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?","Yeah, it really takes the pressure off."
"No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, Im not going to enjoy this party.",Then I guess congratulations are in order.,"Its time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that."
"At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.","I know, Im familiar with you.","No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, Im not going to enjoy this party."
"You know whats interesting about caves, Leonard?","Yes, I was there.","At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
Nothing.,What?,"You know whats interesting about caves, Leonard?"
"Hows this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that youve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement.

Well heres an interesting turn of events.,"Of course, but its all Indian food. You cant find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.",You dont have buffets in India?
A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.,What.  Howard brought a date?,Well heres an interesting turn of events.
An actual real scientist.  How was that?,"Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?",Howard Wolowitz.
I cant believe he fired me.,An actual real scientist.  How was that?,"Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?"
"In my defence, I prefaced that by saying with all due respect.","Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.",I cant believe he fired me.
Morning.,Morning,"In my defence, I prefaced that by saying with all due respect."
"This isnt breakfast, its an experiment.",Youre making eggs for breakfast?,Morning.
"I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.",Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.,"This isnt breakfast, its an experiment."
As do I.,Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.,"I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."

Its my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.,"Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?",Morning.
"What do you want, mom?","But intelligently designed by a creator, right?",Its my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
Yeah.,You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?,"What do you want, mom?"
What for?,"Well, Im done fishing.  You put those on.",Yeah.
No.,"Because youre going to go down to your office, youre going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.",What for?
"Im not going to apologise, I didnt say anything that wasnt true.","Im sorry, did I start that sentence with the words if it please your highness?",No.
Why not?,"Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, its okay to be smarter than everybody but you cant go around pointing it out.","Im not going to apologise, I didnt say anything that wasnt true."

Im not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.,Really? What happened?,I got my job back.

"Oh, Im sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?",Thank you Sheldon.,"He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure."
"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one.

"Youre a lucky man, Leonard.","If Penny didnt know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out.

"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you. hey look, that fixes the problem Ive been having.",Oh yeah. But doesnt that fix the problem youve been having?,"Of course Im sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the signs been changed."
You did this?,Youre welcome.,"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you. hey look, that fixes the problem Ive been having."
Cool?,"Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?",You did this?
"Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!","Thank you, Ill see you at work.","Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night."

"Boy, youre wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.","Wuh, I dont. th-th-th-thats really two different questions, uh, Im not. Sheldon, we have to go!","So, is it serious, do you like her?"
Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?,"Thank you. What did she mean, shes happy for me? Is she happy because Im seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that Im happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.","Alright, well, Ill talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard."
Shes not that intelligent.,"You know what, Im being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, shes attractive, we like each other, shes extremely intelligent.",Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
She got lucky.,She fixed your equation.,Shes not that intelligent.
I dont have to believe in it for her to be lucky.,You dont believe in luck.,She got lucky.
Leonard?,"Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, Im not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.",I dont have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
I still dont care.,Yeah.,Leonard?
"You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.","Well, that parts true!",A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
"I wont go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.",No kidding.,"You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant."
"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.",Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.,"I wont go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger."
"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You cant grow soup.",Really?,"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation."
"Terrific, youll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.","So, hows everything.","Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You cant grow soup."
Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?,"Really, oh yay!","Terrific, youll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?,"Oh, oh thats too bad. Well hey, dont worry, Im sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. ."
"Of course Im listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.",Are you even listening to me?,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
"You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.","I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.","Yes, but you dont have to lose to Kyle Bernsteins Bar-Mitzvah party."
"No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.","Sheldon, let it go.","You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command."
"I was giving clear, concise orders.","I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.","No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back."
"Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.","So, how was paintball, did you have fun?",Morning maam.
Dancing?,"Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, itll just be a bunch of my friends, well have some beer, do a little dancing",A boy-girl party?
"The thing is, were not.","Yeah, I dont know, Penny",Dancing?
No.,Were really more.,"The thing is, were not."
A Halloween party?,"Are you sure? Come on, its Halloween.","But thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
"Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?","Um, yeah, Halloween.",Is there a theme?
What about comic-books?,Sure.,"Hes asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy"
Anime?,Fine.,What about comic-books?
"TV , film, DD, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods",Of course.,Anime?
Oh no!,"Oh, no.","Gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
"See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.",Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!,Oh no!
"I dont care if anybody gets it, Im going as the Doppler Effect.","Hey, Sheldon, theres something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.","Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and youre dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but its basically the same look, man."
"If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!","No, its not","I dont care if anybody gets it, Im going as the Doppler Effect."
"Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?","Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.","If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!"
"Well, theres nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.","For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.","Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
And you said the party starts at seven.,Late? Its 7:05.,"Hey, sorry were late."
Its 7:05.,"Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.",And you said the party starts at seven.
So what time does the costume parade start?,"Probably, but in their own homes.","What, are all the girls in the bathroom?"
"Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.",The parade?,So what time does the costume parade start?
This party is just going to suck.,"Oh, Sheldon, Im sorry but there arent going to be any parades or judges or prizes.","Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
Yes. Its the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.,"Oh, hes the Doppler Effect.","No you dont. Oh, hey, whats Sheldon supposed to be."
"See, people get it.",Okay.,"Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, Ive got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable."
"Im confused. If theres no costume parade, what are we doing here?","No thanks, peanuts, I cant afford to swell up in these tights.","Mmmm, by Odins beard, this is good Chex Mix."
Telepathically?,Were socialising. Meeting new people.,"Im confused. If theres no costume parade, what are we doing here?"
And thats the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.,"Shes not Catwoman, shes just a generic cat.","Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berrys."
"Well, I actually might be able to help.","I want to get to know Pennys friends, I just, I dont know how to talk to these people.","No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.",How so?,"Well, I actually might be able to help."
"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting How wasted am I? which is met with an approving chorus of Dude.",Go on.,"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will."
Thats as far as Ive gotten.,Then what happens?,"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting How wasted am I? which is met with an approving chorus of Dude."
Good luck.,"This is ridiculous, Im jumping in.",Thats as far as Ive gotten.
"Oh, I hardly think so.","No, youre coming with me.",Good luck.
Arent you afraid Ill embarrass you?,Come on.,"Oh, I hardly think so."
"Alright, but if were going to use flight metaphors Im much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.",Yes. But I need a wing-man.,Arent you afraid Ill embarrass you?
Hello.,Hi.,"Oh, Hi!"
Me? Ill give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!,"So, what are you supposed to be?",Hello.

Neeeeeooooowwwwww!,A brain damaged choo-choo train?,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
Im the Doppler Effect.,I still dont get it.,Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
"Well, why dont you just tell people youre one of the seven dwarves.",Why dont you just tell people youre a zebra?,"Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think its very insensitive."
"Yes, well, Im the Doppler Effect.",Because Im Frodo.,"Well, why dont you just tell people youre one of the seven dwarves."
What?,Oh no.,"Yes, well, Im the Doppler Effect."
What do you suppose hes doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.,Thats Pennys ex-boyfriend.,What?
"Oh, snap. So I guess well be leaving now.","If he were any bigger, hed have moons orbiting him.",What do you suppose hes doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
You have a back-up hypothesis.,"Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesnt even want him here. .","Oh, snap. So I guess well be leaving now."
"Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.",Maybe they just want to be friends.,You have a back-up hypothesis.
"Yes, but youre much closer to it than he is.",Then he and I are on equal ground.,"Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more."
"And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.","Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.","Yes, but youre much closer to it than he is."
True. Why dont you text him that and see if he backs down?,"Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldnt have to back down.","And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy."
"Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?",No. Im going to assert my dominance face to face.,True. Why dont you text him that and see if he backs down?
"Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.","Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?",Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
Yet another child left behind.,"What, youre a zebra, right?","Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system."
"Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.",So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?,"Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior."
Im not. No offence.,I think were all talking to Penny here.,"Well, whatever, why dont you go hop off on a quest, Im talking to Penny here."
"If he understands that, youre in trouble.","No, I said animalistic. Of course were all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.","Of course not, no, hes not, youre not, right Leonard?"
Youre in trouble.,"So what, Im unevolved?","If he understands that, youre in trouble."
"Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.","Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.",I think Ive made my point.
Hes a Hobbit! Ive got your back.,Fine. Youre one lucky little leprechaun.,"I dont care, Im finishing it, put him down."
"Happy Halloween.  If its any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.","Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.","Yeah, no, Im fine. Its good, its a good party, thanks for having us, its just getting a little late so."
Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?,Whats that?,"Happy Halloween.  If its any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place."
Good. There there was really all I had.,No.,Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
Good night Leonard.,Good night Sheldon.,Good. There there was really all I had.
Coming.,"Thats right, you saw what you saw. Thats how we roll in The Shire.",Probably.
Hes not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.,"Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?",Coming.
Thank you for the clarification.,"Hes not the Marvel comic story, hes the original Norse God.",Hes not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
Well Im sure hell be fine. He has his hammer.,Im supposed to give him a ride home.,Thank you for the clarification.
"If were all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.","Oh, thats very impressive. And a little racist.",Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. .
"Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.",So? Well start now.,"If were all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06."

"You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?","Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so shes kind of family.","So, if you dont like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?"
Oh good grief.,"Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand youre new in town.","No, yeah shes definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at wheres Howard?"
"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note its 8:13 and were still not playing Halo.","Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.",Oh good grief.

What?,"Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.","Okay, thats it, I dont know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game."
"You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.","This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, its raining you!",What?

"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.","Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?","Well first, we dont have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent Id ask you to leave."
"So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.",So?,"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.,"Im sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?","So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon."

It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally sleep tight."
"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal.",Pennys still sleeping.,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2 milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who."

"No more talking, everybody go.",Sheldon you just cant dictate,"Well then, its all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and Ill watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point its more like Doctor Why Bother."

Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.,I see a problem.,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Sos chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.","So, well just order three entrees.",Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
"Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.",We could cut it into thirds.,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling."
"Hes putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, thats punishable by death.","Hi fellas. Oh, wheres your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?","Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich."
"No, if we fill up on dumplings well need to eliminate another entree.",That works.,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, thats twelve, well each have four."
"And divide it how, Im telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.","If we have extra, well just take the leftovers home.",No eliminations.

What about the won-tons?,"Yeah, we can always divide soup.",How about soup?
Its Halo night.,"Oh, hey guys, whats up?",What about the won-tons?

Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
"You cant go out, its Halo night.","Oh, thats so sweet. But Im going out dancing with a girlfriend.","Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I dont think I need to tell you what an honour this is."
You go dancing every Wednesday.,"Well, for Penny its dancing night.","You cant go out, its Halo night."
Then its not dancing night.,No.,You go dancing every Wednesday.
"Tonight is Halo night, its like talking to a wall.","Look, why dont I play with you guys tomorrow?",Then its not dancing night.
"Yes, but you didnt portray her as completely irrational.","Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.","Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem."
"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we cant, there are three of us and two of them.",Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.,"Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck."
"Its the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is childs play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67 of a woman.",So?,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we cant, there are three of us and two of them."
"Your angers not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.","Aaah, for Gods sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.","Its the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is childs play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67 of a woman."

My point.,"Youre right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.","No, Im going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems."
Its Halo night.,What are you guys doing here?,Why dont you stop butting in where you dont belong.

You seemed confused.,Why are you telling me about my own culture?,"If I may, your parents probably dont consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their childrens lives."
It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have ones children enter the medical profession.,"Actually, I read somewhere that its one of the most popular programmes in India.","Neither do I. Doogie Howsers been off the air for like, twenty years."
Whats not to love?,I bet they love Scrubs.,I bet youre right.
I suggest you go through with it.,"Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?",Whats not to love?
"Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.",What?,I suggest you go through with it.

Fine. Ill have a virgin cuba libre.,"Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.",Ill have a diet coke.
"Yes,","Thats, um, rum and coke without the rum.",Fine. Ill have a virgin cuba libre.
Yes. And would you make it diet?,So coke.,"Yes,"
A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.,Theres a can in the fridge.,Yes. And would you make it diet?
Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.,Then swim to Cuba.,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
And now well never know.,"Um, Raj, honey, you say you cant talk to women but youve been talking to me.","No, no, lets see how long it takes him."

"Nothing, I just really didnt want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.",What happened?,Sorry Im late.
"In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.",Okay.,"Nothing, I just really didnt want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please."
"So, hows Koothrappali d. oh my Lord.","Oh, Ill wedge it right in there.","In a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
Thats Princess Punchali.,What?,"So, hows Koothrappali d. oh my Lord."
"No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.",Im pretty sure her names Lalita.,Thats Princess Punchali.
Its a childrens story.,"Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.","No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess."
"When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. Its about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.","Oh, no it isnt.",Its a childrens story.
That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?,"We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?",I know the reason.
"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.","Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isnt it great, she isnt fat any more!","Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but"
You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.,Im sorry?,"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.,"Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?",You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
You Indian.,"Oh. Us Indian, or come to our casino Indian?",A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.,Oh.,You Indian.
I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.,Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.,The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
"It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.","Dont be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.","But youre a dentist, hes nuts."
What?,Back off Sheldon.,Oh my.
Im not hitting on her.,If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.,What?
Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.,"Okay, lets get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly dont need to be getting this old world crap from you.",You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
"Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.",But youre not Princess Punchali.,"Hey, you cant talk to me like that."
I could eat.,"Sheldon, are you hungry?","Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
"How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?","Go ahead, tell my parents why they wont have any grandchildren.","Turn us, turn us."
What did I do?,"Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.",Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.
"Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.",You left with his date. Friends dont do that to each other.,What did I do?
And may I point out she wouldnt have asked me to go with her if you hadnt been drunk and boring.,"Take it, Raj. Its more than Ive ever gotten.",Sorry? Thats all you can say is sorry?
"And boring, her words.",Drunk?,And may I point out she wouldnt have asked me to go with her if you hadnt been drunk and boring.
"Okay, well, good night.",Please wait until I get into the hall.,Now listen to me.
"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didnt already know, and I came home.",Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?,"Okay, well, good night."
Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist.,So youre not going to see her again?,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didnt already know, and I came home."
"Look at me, look at me, Ive got goosebumps.","Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this .","Okay, the X10s are online."
"No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.","Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.","Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
"Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.",No.,"No, hang on, hang on.  See!"
They found the remote controlled cars.,Because we can.,"Huh, well thats handy. Um, heres a question, why?"

"Well, theres always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occams Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.","Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?",Not to mention youd have to power down on Saturdays.
I know. I read it before I threw it out.,Its from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.,"Well, theres always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occams Razor would suggest that someone threw it out."
"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldnt recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.","Okay if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.",I know. I read it before I threw it out.
"Leonard, please dont take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.",Are there any other honours Ive gotten that I dont know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?,Forget the parties? What a nerd.
"No we dont. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.","Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.","Ive got one, hey Leonard, your mammas research methodology is so flawed."
You cant. Im the lead author.,"Okay, let me put it this way, Im doing it.","No we dont. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional."

"Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.",I didnt screw it up.,Because I knew youd screw this up.
So you admit that youre an egotist?,"Ive had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didnt go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense.

"Well thats not much of an apology, but Ill take it.","Youre right, Im the problem, Im the one that needs help.","I really dont understand what youre so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, theres just no pleasing you."
Yes. Im sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.,Excuse me. Is there anything youd like to apologise for?,"Well thats not much of an apology, but Ill take it."

You just lied to Penny.,See you.,"Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys."
"And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.","Yes, I did.",You just lied to Penny.
"So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.",So?,"And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
"No, I imagine if you were going to kill me youd have done it a long time ago.","Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.","So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath."
Leonard,Thats very true.,"No, I imagine if you were going to kill me youd have done it a long time ago."
I need to speak to you.,What?,Leonard
Its important.,Its two oclock in the morning,I need to speak to you.
Yes.,I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?,Its important.
"Youre right, it can wait until morning.",What?,Yes.
"Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, youre in no state to talk.","What, what, what, what, what?","Youre right, it can wait until morning."
Im uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.,"Sheldon, what is it?","Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, youre in no state to talk."
You could have told her the truth.,What was I supposed to say.,Im uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
Is that a relevant factor?,That would have hurt her feelings.,You could have told her the truth.
Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.,Yes.,Is that a relevant factor?
"I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, Id recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.",And what would I have said afterwards?,Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Why?,"I couldnt say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I cant wait to hear you sing again.","I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, Id recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
I was not aware of that.,"Its the social protocol, its what you do when you have a friend whos proud of something they really suck at.",Why?

Hungry? Tired? Im sorry this really isnt my strong suit.,Well imagine how Im feeling.,"He lied, and Im feeling very uncomfortable about it."
To help you.,"You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?",Hungry? Tired? Im sorry this really isnt my strong suit.

"No, I made him up. I think youd call him Lee.",Do you have a cousin Leopold.,"Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details."

"No, of course not, theres no cousin Leo, theres no intervention, focus Leonard.",Were going to Long Beach?,"Ah, because its in Long Beach, and I dont drive."
"We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.","Oh, come on!","No, of course not, theres no cousin Leo, theres no intervention, focus Leonard."
"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.",So he goes back into rehab?,"We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab."
"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which Im assuming is embarrassing, yes?",You still told her I lied.,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
"Thats the best part, you dont have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so shes agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.",I dont know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which Im assuming is embarrassing, yes?"

"Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.",Okay. So whats up?,Uh-huh!
"Okay, sure. I dont see a problem with that.","Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.","No, its okay, its your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening."
Good for you.,"Its okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farmian",Well I dont know what to say.
Break a leg.,"Yeah, uh, break a leg.",Thanks Penny.
"Its a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, its now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.","Oh, too bad. Ive always wanted to go to Long Beach.",Because Sheldon doesnt have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
"No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then its iffy.",Shotgun.,Im game.
Leonard,"Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?","No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then its iffy."
"No, thats the least of our worries. Ive been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think theres a problem with the current version of our lie.","Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.",Leonard
"Sadly, its not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.","What are you talking about, its fine, she bought it, its over.","No, thats the least of our worries. Ive been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think theres a problem with the current version of our lie."
Because Leo is a middle child.,Why not?,"Sadly, its not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
"You didnt read the bio, did you? Hes not just a middle child, hes the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.","There is no Leo, how can you say that?",Because Leo is a middle child.
"Great, what is it?",Ive got a solution.,"You didnt read the bio, did you? Hes not just a middle child, hes the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
Fine.  Well talk in the morning.,Get out.,"Great, what is it?"
"Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.","Au contraire. Im 26 years old, Im originally from  Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result Ive often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.","Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo."
"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.","Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.","Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
"Im sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, hes a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.",Sheldon?,"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you."
"Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.","Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?",It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.
"No. Were going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.","Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.",Oh!
"Subtextually, of course.  Morning Penny.","Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?","No. Were going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
"Unfortunately, we werent able to convince him to go to rehab.",Hi. How did the intervention go.,"Subtextually, of course.  Morning Penny."
"But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.","Well, based on what you told me, Im not surprised.","Unfortunately, we werent able to convince him to go to rehab."
Dont forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.,"The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.",Im Im sorry.

"So, you see it too.",That is a problem.,"No, he would be exactly the same."
"Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.",And hes only fifteen years old.,"Graduate work, very impressive."
"Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.","I already know youre not. You dont have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.","I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why were the best physics research facility in the country."

"Yes. Thats what a rational person does when his entire lifes work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.","Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?",We liked Leonard.

"Well thats a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.","Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.",How do you know anything about physics?
"Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!",You didnt answer question.,"Well thats a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
Well its not what he said.,"AA, I need your official answer.","Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!"
I want a different question.,Then what is it?,Well its not what he said.
Formal protest.,You cant have a different question.,I want a different question.
Informal protest.,Denied.,Formal protest.
No. I decline to provide one.,Denied. I need your official answer.,Informal protest.
Thats your opinion.,"Well, thats too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.",No. I decline to provide one.
I dont understand the question.,"Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.","Alright, the winner of the match is"
Who?,"Sorry, somebodys sitting there.",The winner is PMS!
"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win.",My Physics Bowl Trophy!,Who?
Who?,I know someone who would disagree.,"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win."
Alright that is very immature.,"My Physics Bowl Trophy!  Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?",Who?
Absolutely.,"Im settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?",What are you doing?
The Brady Bunch?,"Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?",Bring it on.
William Shatner.,"I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazines sexiest man alive?",How do you know these things?
Then its got to be Patrick Stewart.,"Wait, I dont think its Shatner.",William Shatner.
Formal protest.,No.,Then its got to be Patrick Stewart.
Romulan.,"Alright, singer who sang Oops I Did It Again.  Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?",Formal protest.
"Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.",Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.,Romulan.
Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. Its the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.,What did they give you?,"Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
"I know, its basic culinary science.",I dont believe it.,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. Its the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
You bid 800.,Yeah. And thats my bid.,Its only 800?
Theres only 30 seconds left in the auction.,"It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.",You bid 800.
"I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.",You lucky duck.,"Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
Need you ask? But I still dont understand why no-one else bid.,A time share time machine? Im in. Sheldon?,Why dont we share it? Well each put in two hundred bucks and well take turns having it in our homes.
I understand why no-one else bid.,Need you ask? But I still dont understand why no-one else bid.,A time share time machine? Im in. Sheldon?
"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets no longer want my time machine and need 800.",I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for 800?,Did the listing actually say miniature?
"Ive been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?",Yes but the elevators been broken for two years.,If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
"Its the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.","I cant feel my fingers, hurry up.",If I push any harder Im going to give birth to my colon.
Yeah.,Sheldon?,"Its the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
"Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, theres a small gap, dont look down if youre subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.","I dont have a few minutes, Im running really late.","Uh, just give us a few minutes."
"Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.","Youre joking, right?","Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, theres a small gap, dont look down if youre subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell."
"For what its worth, I thought it was humorous.","Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, its not never mind.","Damn, okay, Ill just take the roof."
I dont know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.,"Lets just do this. Guys, ready to push?"
"The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.",Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.,I dont know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
"Gentlemen, I know we said wed take turns, but I think youd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.","Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, Ive got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!",Talk about your chick magnets.
"Alright, I think were going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.",Hes got a point.,"You cant just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, you wanna come up and see my time machine, its at my friends house, how lame is that?"
"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?",That sounds fair.,I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
Then no.,Twice a month.,"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?"
No.,"Okay, every other month.",Then no.
"Wait a minute, Id want to see that too.","Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.","Sheldon, you cant be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876."
"But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bells lab is going to get very crowded, hell know somethings up.","So, when its your turn you can.","Wait a minute, Id want to see that too."
"Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.","Mrs Bell was deaf, shes not even going to hear you knock.","And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?"
"If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.","Ooh, how far into the future?","Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
Time machine.,"Not done. By the time I finally got to work, theyd given my shift away. Yeah, thats right, Ive lost an entire days pay thanks to this this",Sorry.
"Again, time machine.","No! I dont want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and and now that that","The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.,"Oh please, its not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.","Again, time machine."
"Leonard, its two in the morning.",My turn!,"Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic."
So its my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?,So?,"Leonard, its two in the morning."
"You cant. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.",Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.,So its my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.",Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?,"You cant. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake."
It wont change the past.,What if I knocked you unconscious right now?,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious."
Are you upset about something?,But it would make the present so much nicer.,It wont change the past.
"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability",What was your first clue?,Are you upset about something?
Oh! I dont usually pick up on those things. Good for me.,Yes Im upset.,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability"
"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about whats bothering you?","Yeah, good for you.",Oh! I dont usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
"Wow, Im on fire tonight.",I dont know. Maybe.,"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about whats bothering you?"
I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.,"Uh, heres the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.","Wow, Im on fire tonight."
"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.",Thanks for pointing it out.,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
Well of course theyre movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? Thats absurd.,Those are movies.,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother."
Its still my turn.,"Oh, Leonard.","Dont worry baby, Ive got you."
What are you doing?,Its still my turn.,"Oh, Leonard."
Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.,Im packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.,What are you doing?
My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.,Just personal reasons.,Why?
"Ill go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.","Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.",I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
Dibs doesnt apply in a bidding war.,"I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.",Well you cant just call dibs.
"Whats the number, Ill match it.",He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.,Will you forget dibs!
Whats the exchange rate.,"Ill match it, plus a thousand rupees.","Whats the number, Ill match it."
"Who cares, as long as you pick me.","Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.","Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel."
No. I cant let you do this.,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.","Okay, Leonard, put down the box, lets talk."
None shall pass.,"Sheldon, get out of my way.",No. I cant let you do this.
You hypocrite!,What the hells going on?,"Okay man, be cool, were all friends here."
"Little Miss grown ups dont play with toys. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!",What?,You hypocrite!
"It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked.",My turn on the time machine.,"Oh, stop it! Bye guys."
We have to get rid of the time machine.,"Sheldon, are you okay?","It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked."
"Yeah, thats the problem, its too big.","It is a little big for the living room, isnt it?",We have to get rid of the time machine.
Thank you for coming by.  Hello.,"Well, that should do it.","I know, Im disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again."
Buddy.,"Oh, hey buddy.",Thank you for coming by.  Hello.
"How can you be late, I wasnt expecting you at all.","Sorry Im late, Im working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.",Buddy.
"Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and youve already met Howard.","Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?","Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and BAM!  Howard Wolowitz."
"Shes my twin sister, she thinks shes funny but frankly Ive never been able to see it.",Excuse me?,"Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head."
How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?,"Its because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.","Shes my twin sister, she thinks shes funny but frankly Ive never been able to see it."
Rajesh.,"Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and Im sorry what was your name again.","Well, I think youre delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole."
"The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didnt she.",And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dads estate.,"Destiny, thy name is Anaheim."
"They call me a genius because Im a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that Im having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.",I guess thats why they call you a genius.,"The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didnt she."
"They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.","Oh, I dont think so. Shelly doesnt like company. Even as a little boy hed send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.","If the weddings not until tomorrow, why dont you stay with us tonight?"
No we dont.,"Look, youre here, we have plenty of room.","They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues."
So what? I dont issue invitations to your mother.,"Come on, Shelly, shes family.",No we dont.
And dont ever call me Shelly.,Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.,So what? I dont issue invitations to your mother.
What just happened?,"Ill walk you to your car. Youre in structure 3 level C, right?",So its settled. Youll stay with us.
I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.,"Hee-hee, just classic.","So anyway, were eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace."
Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.,He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.,Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.,"Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?"
"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.",Can I get a hallelujah.,"Wow, you dont look that much alike."
Im not ignoring my sister. Im ignoring all of you.,"Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?","Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall and perfect."
"Excuse me, can I interject something. Im ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?","Hell, no!",So I can have Penny?
"I guess. Dont worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.","Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?","Excuse me, can I interject something. Im ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?"
Thats okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.,Thank you.,"I guess. Dont worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. Its noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.","Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?","Hey, look at me, I dont have a foreskin."
"I didnt say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.","Thats fascinating, but I","Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. Its noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence."
"Oh. Okay. You know, I dont want to criticise your rhetorical style but, wed be a lot further along in this conversation if youd begun with that thought.","Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz theyre hitting on your sister.","I didnt say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
What Im saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.,"Thats great, but I.","Oh. Okay. You know, I dont want to criticise your rhetorical style but, wed be a lot further along in this conversation if youd begun with that thought."
Why?,Whatever. You have to do something about it.,What Im saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
"I dont understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then weve pretty much gone our own separate ways.",Because shes your sister.,Why?
I hadnt considered that. We do share DNA.,"Okay, uh. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.","I dont understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then weve pretty much gone our own separate ways."
"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.",Uh-huh.,I hadnt considered that. We do share DNA.
"Youre right. If someone wants to get at Missys fallopian tubes, theyll have to go through me.","Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sisters future offspring.","So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself."
"Alright, thats enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. Im going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.","Im warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.","I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!"
"Youre out too, by the way.","Hes the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.",Who are you to decide that?
"Its nothing personal, Id just prefer if my future niece or nephew didnt become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.",Say what?,"Youre out too, by the way."
"Now that Leonards made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.","Im not happy, its the medication, I cant stop smiling.",What are you so happy about?
How so?,"Excuse me, but I think youre missing a big opportunity here.","We all make mistakes, lets move on."
"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.",Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.,How so?
"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that youre a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.","Is it cause Im Jewish, cause Id kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.","In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.,"Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.","This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that youre a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother."
Oops.,Oh really?,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.,"Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?",Oops.
"Truthfully, Ive never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.",Okay. Im not even going to ask why youre pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?,"We all make mistakes, lets move on."
"Let me explain. You see, Im a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.",What on earth are you talking about?,"Truthfully, Ive never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.","And what do you mean, mediocre stock?","Let me explain. You see, Im a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock."
"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If youre not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.",Sheldon 2.0?,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will."
Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.,You have got to be kidding me!,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If youre not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, thats where the metaphor ended.","Okay Shelly, sit down. Now Ive lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of Gods special little people.",Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
I have an alternate proposal.,"I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?","I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, thats where the metaphor ended."
"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.",Go on.,I have an alternate proposal.
Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.,"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.",Go on.
I weep for humanity.,"Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.","Come on, come on, get up."
"Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.",Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?,We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.
"Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.","Yeah, Ill just tell her you said hey.","Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory."
Really?,"Come on, Shelly.  I want you to know Im very proud of you.","Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles."
You tell people Im a rocket scientist?,"Yup, Im always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.",Really?
Im a theoretical physicist.,Well yeah.,You tell people Im a rocket scientist?
Whats the difference?,Whats the difference?,Im a theoretical physicist.
"We might as well stop, its a stalemate. Youre beating me in tetris, but youve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.","Yeah, thats terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you",It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.
"He cant eat cheesecake, hes lactose intolerant.","So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?","Keebler Elf? Ive got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay, its a stalemate."
What about the cream cheese frosting.,"Okay, he can have carrot cake.","He cant eat cheesecake, hes lactose intolerant."
"For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.","I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybodys until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.","Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?"
"Its actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.","Uh, thats so silly.","No, its no big deal, its just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
"It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if shed also denied him Christmas hed be a little better at it.","What was it called, I hate my son and thats why he cant have cake?","Its actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it."
Hello Penny. Leonard just left.,"Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you cant eat peanuts. They see me coming they go ah, no peanut boy!",Make sure they remember no peanuts.
"What would we talk about? Weve no overlapping areas of interest Im aware of, and you know I dont care for chit-chat.",I know. I want to talk to you.,Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
"Well alright, but I dont see this as a promising endeavour.","Okay, can you just let me in.","What would we talk about? Weve no overlapping areas of interest Im aware of, and you know I dont care for chit-chat."
"I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesnt want a party.","Okay, heres the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.","Well alright, but I dont see this as a promising endeavour."
I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.,"Fine. If I do have a threesome, you cant be part of it. Im just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?","Howard, heres the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over."
"Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.",Anguish?,I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.","Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.","Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation."
In addition I really dont think that Leonard wants a,Nevertheless we are.,"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity."
"You cant do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book its no longer mint.","Okay, heres the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you wont know which, Ill draw a tiny happy face in ink.",In addition I really dont think that Leonard wants a
"Well of course I oh! Yeah, I have an idea, lets throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.","Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?","You cant do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book its no longer mint."
Thats not the secret knock. This is the secret knock.,"Well of course I oh! Yeah, I have an idea, lets throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.","Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?"
The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of ones co-conspirators.,What difference does it make?,Thats not the secret knock. This is the secret knock.
"Possibly, but unverified.",Is that Raj and Howard?,The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of ones co-conspirators.
Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.,Can you just let us in.,"Possibly, but unverified."
Thats because I didnt bring one.,"Uh, Sheldon, I didnt see your present.","Okay, well, he might like that, Ive seen him chilly."
The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.,Dont ask.,Well why not?
"Lets say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, its a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?",Too late.,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
"I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.","Well, Sheldon, youre his friend. Friends give each other presents.",Told you not to ask.
Oh. Fair enough.,Its a non-optional social convention.,Just do it.
"Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I dont drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.",He came with a manual.,Oh. Fair enough.
"Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.","Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.","Yeah, no."
"You mean, like a sweater?","Sheldon, a gift shouldnt be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldnt buy for themselves.","Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner."
Is it the geometry that makes it fun.,"Well, its a fun sweater, its got a bold geometric print.","You mean, like a sweater?"
"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.","Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.",Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
"Something he wouldnt buy for himself. Something fun. Something like oh, an 802.11n wireless router.",Exactly.,"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner."
What do you think.,"Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh.  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, its out of the washer. Ill call you when its in the dryer.","Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.,"Um, that one.",What do you think.
"He doesnt need them, hes already got a 640 connect switch",Sure.,Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
Why?,"Oh, okay then this one.","He doesnt need them, hes already got a 640 connect switch"
"Penny! If Im going to buy Leonard a gift, Im going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.","I dont know, the man on the box looks so happy.",Why?
"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.","Oh, I know Im going to regret this but, what trauma?","Penny! If Im going to buy Leonard a gift, Im going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did."
"Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me wow, this is hard. They got me a motorised dirt bike.",Of course.,"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes."
What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?,No?,"Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me wow, this is hard. They got me a motorised dirt bike."
Really?,All of them.,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
Huh?,Yeah.,Really?
"Yeah, I suppose.","Okay, so were getting this one?",Huh?
I know everything about this stuff.,"Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?","Okay, lets go."
"No, no, no, no, she doesnt want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.","Here, buy this one. Look, its the one were getting, see, happy guy available.","Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse."
It depends on what Bus you have.,"Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?",Thank you.
"Oh, dear lord.",I drive a Chevy Cavalier.,It depends on what Bus you have.
"Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me.  You hold on, Ill be right with you. What computer do you have, and please dont say a white one?","Sheldon, we have to go.","Oh, dear lord."
"Okay, we dont have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.",Thy will be done.,"Ive got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, Ive got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic whos two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat."
"Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.","Excuse me, sir, you dont work here.",Him.
Why?,"Sheldon, we have to go.","Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else."
"Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.",Keep walking.,"Well, for one thing, were late for Leonards birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security."
Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.,Happy birthday anyways.,"Oh, its okay."
Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon.,"No, its Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon.",Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
Thats what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.,Whats this?,Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon.
How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher its your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.,Well its not.,Thats what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
Why?,"You know, Im really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.",How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher its your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
Mai du lui tsa.,Hey!,Once youre fluent youll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.
"My apologies Leonard, Im only as good as my teacher.",You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.,Mai du lui tsa.
I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.,Why are you learning Chinese?,"My apologies Leonard, Im only as good as my teacher."
"Okay, where were we?","Oh, Ill tell you whats going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.",Whats going on?
"Not surprising. Pennys emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesnt want to talk.","Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesnt want to talk.",GO AWAY!
Im not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.,"Im not going to do that, Howard.","Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel."
"Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. Youd also have to be knighted for that to apply.",What about damsel in distress?,Im not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
"Howard, Im going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didnt make my point with those people.","Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.","Im going over to Mikes. Leonard, thank you so much."
"I like tangerine chicken, Im not getting tangerine chicken.","For Gods sake, Sheldon, if you dont like the tangerine chicken, dont order the tangerine chicken.","Howard, Im going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didnt make my point with those people."
"Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.","Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.","She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!"

A second what? Pair of underwear?,"Im sorry. Look, do you have a second.",Aieee ya! Xia si wo le.
Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? Its about Leonard.,A second what? Pair of underwear?
"Yes, I suppose he is.","Well, Raj cant talk to me unless hes drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.",Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
"Not necessarily. Im often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I dont condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.","All Im saying is, you know Leonard the best.","Yes, I suppose he is."
Were not done?,"Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment.","Not necessarily. Im often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

"Ach, why not? Were already through the looking glass anyway.",No.,Were not done?
"Well, he didnt actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.","Okay, so, heres the thing. I guess youre aware that Leonard asked me out.","Ach, why not? Were already through the looking glass anyway."
"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I dont spend much time here and so Ive never really chosen a place to sit.","Oh, thats nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just want to sit down?","Well, he didnt actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia."
"There are a number of options and, Im really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.","Well, choose.","Oh, I wish it were that simple.

"No, no, thats crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.","Alright, why dont you just pick one at random, and then if you dont like it you can sit somewhere else next time.","There are a number of options and, Im really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
"A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.","Okay. Um, heres the thing. So, Ive known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me","No, no, thats crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out."
Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon,"Alright, yeah, I dont really know who they are","A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy."
Leonard isnt the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?,"Yeah, I dont care, I dont care. The point is Leonard isnt the kind of guy I usually go out with.",Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon
"The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!","No. What Im saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.",Leonard isnt the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?
"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time.","But on the other hand, if things dont go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess hes not looking for a fling, hes the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I dont know, like you would say light years.","The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!"
"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, thats a unit of work, not of weight.",Thank you for the clarification.,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time."
Its a common mistake.,"Right, thanks.","Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, thats a unit of work, not of weight."
Okay. I think this will be my seat.,Not the first one Ive made today.,Its a common mistake.
"Well, lets see. We might consider Schrodingers Cat.","Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what Im talking about.",Okay. I think this will be my seat.
"No. Thats Mrs Grossinger. And she doesnt have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip",Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?,"Well, lets see. We might consider Schrodingers Cat."
"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.",Sheldon!,"No. Thats Mrs Grossinger. And she doesnt have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip"
"Well of course you dont get it, I havent made it yet. Youd have to be psychic to get it, and theres no such thing as psychic.","Im sorry, I dont get the point.","Sorry, you diverted me.

"Just like Schrodingers Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that youll find out which it is.","Sheldon, whats the point?","Well of course you dont get it, I havent made it yet. Youd have to be psychic to get it, and theres no such thing as psychic."
"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again.

"I can see that. Unless youre planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.","Sheldon, I think Ive made a mistake.",Two seats right there.
"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, youll have to narrow it down.","No, its about Penny.","I can see that. Unless youre planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
Then dont.,I dont think I can go out with her tonight.,"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, youll have to narrow it down."
Other people might be interested.,Other people would say why not?,Then dont.
I assumed you would.,Im going to talk anyway.,Other people might be interested.
"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.","Now that Im actually about to go out with Penny, Im not excited, Im nauseous.",I assumed you would.
"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.",Right.,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion."
"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.","Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it.","You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on."
"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?",Youre not helping.,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny.

Schrodingers Cat.,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
"You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.","Wow, thats brilliant.",Schrodingers Cat.
Show me your mucus! Your mucus!,"Alright, the cats alive, lets go to dinner.",Good.
This is not a tangerine bicycle.,Blow your own nose and go away.,Show me your mucus! Your mucus!
"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.","Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?","Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?"
"Oh, even I know thats lame.","Well, we sort of decided to wing it.","Oh really, did you make a second date."
"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.","Nice close up, by the way.","Lets go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
"Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.",Thats not a bad sign.,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans."
"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so Id avoid using that for your delicates.",Hi.,Give him time.
"Oh, good Lord. Why dont you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?",Thanks.,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so Id avoid using that for your delicates."
"I would prefer that you not, but I wont go so far as to forbid it.","Sheldon, may I ask you a question?","Oh, good Lord. Why dont you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?"
Well I assume youre not referring to digestive regularity? Because Ive come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.,"Alright, I heard yes, so okay, heres my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.","I would prefer that you not, but I wont go so far as to forbid it."
"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.","No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasnt a braniac?",Well I assume youre not referring to digestive regularity? Because Ive come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
"Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.",How is that not a braniac?,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature."
That depends.,"So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating hell eventually get bored with me.","Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature."
Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?,On what?,That depends.
Do you speak Klingon?,No.,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
Do you know any card tricks?,No.,Do you speak Klingon?
Why would you lie about that?,"Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.",Do you know any card tricks?
You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?,"Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didnt want him to think I was some stupid loser.",Why would you lie about that?
"Yeah, but you were neither.","You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.",You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
Youre asking me to keep a secret?,"Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.","Yeah, but you were neither."
"Well Im sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You cant impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.",Yeah.,Youre asking me to keep a secret?
"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  Its a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.",What?,"Well Im sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping.

Physiologically impossible.,"Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.","Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour.

So youre saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?,"Oh Sheldon, please, look, Im asking you as a friend.",Physiologically impossible.
"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?","Well, yeah.",So youre saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
"I.e, I couldnt become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.","Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?","Well, yeah."

Hi Penny.,Hey.,Hi guys.
"Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.","Great. So you just let me know when you know. So  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?","You know, Im not sure, the manager hasnt posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know."
Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.,What does that mean?,"Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things."
"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.",No I didnt.,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.,Whats going on with you?,"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir."
"Theres no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.",Whats wrong with your face?,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.

There doesnt have to be a reason.,"What do you mean, youre moving out? Why?","Leonard, Im moving out."
"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausens trilemma.

What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock thats been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?",The people from People.,What people?
"In general, yes.",Are you proud of yourself?,"Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends arent giving her this kind of crap."
"Oh, theres my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, werent you, you little subatomic Dickens?","In general, yes.",Are you proud of yourself?
"Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.",Hi Sheldon.,"Oh, theres my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, werent you, you little subatomic Dickens?"
"Apologise, for what?","Well, were going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.","Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons."
I sense youre trying to tell me something.,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we werent very supportive.","Apologise, for what?"
"Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.",You were a colossal ass-hat.,I sense youre trying to tell me something.
"How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a worlds greatest dad coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.","Really, do tell.","Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive."
I had not considered that.,"Okay, lets try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?","How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a worlds greatest dad coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
I often forget other people have limitations. Its so sad.,Come on.,I had not considered that.
But Im not.,"And when we go in there, lets show Raj that were happy for him.","Not really, its what you and I would call condescension."
"Fine, what do you want me to do?","Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but Im bigger than that.",But Im not.
Dr Gablehauser.,Dr Hoffstadter.,Dr Gablehauser.
"Well, you didnt discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.","Im not talking about you, Im talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.","Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body."
"Oh, sorry.",Sheldon!,"Well, you didnt discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17."
"He gets a new office, I cant even get paper towels in the mens room?","Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbines office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.",Done.
"Damn, this is hard.",Sheldon.,"He gets a new office, I cant even get paper towels in the mens room?"
Aaaah!,You can stop smiling now.,"Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys."
"Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.","Its fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  Theyre going to digitally add a supernova, they say its the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.",No.
Have we at this point met our social obligations?,They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.,"Excuse me. Oh, its my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh."
Now?,"Oh, Im sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.",A lackey?
"Theres a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point.","Oh, youre welcome. Of course, I couldnt get you into the VIP section, because, you know, thats for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.","Oh, gee, thanks."
"I can make it, but I wont.",Sheldon?,"Well, uh, no I the no."
A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.,"And you guys arent going? I cant believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and youre not even going to be there to support him?","Well, theres a reception for my magazine article on Saturday."
Now?,Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I cant believe it took you a whole year.,Shame on you guys.
Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?,Lets just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.,"It cant be racist, hes a beloved character on the Simpsons."
Even though the menu description specifies shredded?,Yes.,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
"Brown rice, not white?",Yes.,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.,Yes.,"Brown rice, not white?"
Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?,Yes.,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
Thank you.,Yes.,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
What took you so long?,Youre welcome.,Thank you.
Fine.,Just sit down and eat.,What took you so long?
I want you to check before you accept the order.,"Alright, its shredded, what do you want me to do?",Fine.
Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?,Sorry.,I want you to check before you accept the order.
"Then theres no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.",Hes not going to have intercourse with Penny.,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
"Thats Northwest Texas, Im from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.","Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.","Then theres no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
"No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.",Do the shrimpers feature in your story?,"Thats Northwest Texas, Im from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers."
"Yes, Lucky.",Lucky?,"No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky."
"While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.","Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.","Hes irony impaired, just move on."
"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.","So, not a puppy?","While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
"Yes, half eagle, half lion.",A griffin?,"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin."
"Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.",And mythological.,"Yes, half eagle, half lion."
"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.","Sheldon, not that we dont all enjoy a good lion semen story, whats your point.","Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
"Thats one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, theyre doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, were playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.",You want to breed a new friend?,"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
"Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and Im not insane, my mother had me tested.","That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldnt kill us to meet some new people.","Sheldon, dont take this the wrong way, but, youre insane."
He should share our love of technology.,"And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.","If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back."
"Good morning, Leonard.",Sorry.,Shes feisty. I like that.
"Yeah, were going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good nights sleep. I dont like the way Darth Vader stares at me.",Uh-huh.,"Good morning, Leonard."
"Oh, just because your careers been stagnant for a few years, thats no reason to give up.",Im not going to work.,"Yeah, were going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good nights sleep.

Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?,"Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.","Oh, just because your careers been stagnant for a few years, thats no reason to give up."
Then you can drive. Lets go.,No.,Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
You did.,"Didnt I tell you Id be working nights, and that youd have to make other arrangements.",Then you can drive. Lets go.
I didnt. Lets go.,And?,You did.
But how am I going to get to work?,"Goodnight, Sheldon.",I didnt. Lets go.
I cant take the bus any more. They dont have seatbelts. And they wont let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.,Take the bus.,But how am I going to get to work?

"No, wait. You have to drive me to work.",Thanks for the update,Leonards asleep.
"But I dont drive, and I cant take the bus.","Yeah, uh, I really dont think I do.","No, wait. You have to drive me to work."
Penny. Didnt you recently state that you and I are friends?,"Yeah, honey, youll be fine as long as you dont do that bungee cord thing, okay?","But I dont drive, and I cant take the bus."
Then I hereby invoke what Im given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.,"Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.",Penny. Didnt you recently state that you and I are friends?

"Typically thats an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.",Mm-hmm.,"Oh, good. Im not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on."
"Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.","Its fine, its been on for, like, a month.","Typically thats an indicator. To, you know, check your engine."
"If it were fine, the light wouldnt be on. Thats why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know its not fine.","Sheldon, its fine.","Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
Is there a check the check engine light light?  O-o-o-oh!,"Uh, maybe the lights broken.","If it were fine, the light wouldnt be on. Thats why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know its not fine."
"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces ones reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.",What?,Is there a check the check engine light light?  O-o-o-oh!
Of course not.,Do you have any alcohol?,"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces ones reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
Youre going up Euclid Avenue?,Too bad.,Of course not.
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.,Mm-hmm.,Youre going up Euclid Avenue?
"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if youre not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Heres a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?","Well, good for Leonard.",Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
"The answers tricky. Its Second Street. You see, youd think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?",No.,"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!","Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.","Look, I need to get to the laser lab, youre just going to have to find someone else to take you home."

"Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?",Over what?,We had a difference of opinion.
"Oh, but Im not going home. Its Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store.

Yes?,Look at that sign up there.,"Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions."
No.,Does it say I give a damn?,Yes?
"Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? Theres no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.",Thats because I dont.,No.
"I dont need your help, Penny.","Sheldon, its C, just put down C.",Look at the sign.
"No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.","Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!","I dont need your help, Penny."
"How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.","Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?","No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."

We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.,"Theres no guawantee weve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so lets thwow down. You know, unless youre afwaid.",What do you mean?
Make it so.,"Tomowow, thwee oclock, the kinetics wab.",We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
"We dont have that option, weve accepted the challenge. We cant run away from a fight.","Sheldon, we have to call it off.",I cant watch anymore.
"Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.","Oh, please, weve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.","We dont have that option, weve accepted the challenge. We cant run away from a fight."
You are overlooking the fact that we now know what were up against and we can modify Monte so that hes prepared.,"Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripkes robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.","Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear."
"Have faith, gentlemen. We dont need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?",Not yet.,"Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?"
"No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.","Neat. Good work. Sheldon, weve got to call this off.",Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.
"What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robots massive size and its overwhelming power.","But, Sheldon, we dont have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.","No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now."
"Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.","Thats not overconfidence, thats observation.","What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robots massive size and its overwhelming power."
"Hes right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.","Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.","I just want to make sure that were all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
Never. Id rather see Monte dead than in your hands.,"I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.","Hes right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death."
Do it.,"That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?",Never. Id rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  Thats new.,"Come on, Sheldon, you got this.",Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.
"Dont hurt us, dont hurt us,","Go, go, go, go!","Go, Monte! Go Monte!"
"I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.","Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.","Dont hurt us, dont hurt us,"
"So what do you think, Howard? Its not that bad, right?",Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.,"Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you dont treat them with respect."
"Youre right. Montes gone. Well bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. Ill speak. Leonard, youll play your cello.","Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? Ive seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.","So what do you think, Howard? Its not that bad, right?"
Just a toy robot?,"Sheldon, honey, arent you getting a little carried away? I mean, its just a toy robot.","Youre right. Montes gone. Well bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. Ill speak. Leonard, youll play your cello."
"First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant","Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.","I know, I got it. Sheldon, Im sorry."
It is extracted from the plant,"Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?","Hey, Im thinking of growing a mustache."
Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.,"Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca","Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
"It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldnt do that anymore!",Feel better now?,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
"Hey its true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.",Fo shizzle.,"Thats why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
"Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!",Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.,"Hey its true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
Whatd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?,Yeah?,"Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!"
"Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why dont you take some time to reconsider?","I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.",Whatd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
Well I think were off to a terrific start.,"Yeah, Ill do that.","Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why dont you take some time to reconsider?"
"Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. Im leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chefs salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chefs salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. Im following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.","Yeah, I got the same one. And thats not a bathing suit, its a tan line.",Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesnt bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
First warning.,"Oh come on, really?",I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
Hi.,Hello Sheldon.,First warning.
"Its a questionnaire I devised. Im having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so Im doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.",What is this?,Hi.
"Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.","Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?","Its a questionnaire I devised. Im having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so Im doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
"I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why dont you just go ahead and write that number 1. Im afraid youre on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.","Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?","Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do."
"Only 211. Dont worry, in deference to you, Ive kept them on a high school graduate reading level.",Wait! How many questions are on this thing?,"I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why dont you just go ahead and write that number 1. Im afraid youre on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours."
"You got it, buddy.",Thanks pal.,"Only 211. Dont worry, in deference to you, Ive kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
Well thats certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.,"Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I dont know, pleasant?","You got it, buddy."
"Your questionnaire, very disappointing.",Well thats certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.,"Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I dont know, pleasant?"
You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.,I answered every question Sheldon.,"Your questionnaire, very disappointing."
How could I not?,"Aw, you picked up on that huh?",You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that Id have better luck making friends if I wait til the Cylons take over? Please.","Come on! Theres over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?",How could I not?
"Yes, well its better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.",Hold on. I put some real work into that!,"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that Id have better luck making friends if I wait til the Cylons take over? Please."
What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?,"Its kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.","Yes, well its better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
I dont see how you could.,"Sheldon, Im not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.",What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
What do you mean!?,"What Im trying to say is that, maybe you cant approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.",I dont see how you could.
I did learn how to swim.,"Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?",What do you mean!?
The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.,On the floor.,I did learn how to swim.
"The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isnt going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I dont have to break new ground here, Im sure much of the research already exists.",Then why learn how to swim?,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
Thats insane on the face of it. Come on.,"No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.","The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isnt going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I dont have to break new ground here, Im sure much of the research already exists."
Youre driving me to the mall. Im going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.,Where are we going?,Thats insane on the face of it. Come on.
Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.,Why dont you just lie down on the floor and swim there?,Youre driving me to the mall. Im going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
Family or friend?,Thank you.,Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
"Too bad. If itd been a friend, Im available to fill the void.  Its just as well, she smelled like moth balls.",Family.,Family or friend?
Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?,"Okay, if youre gonna start sniffing people, Im gonna go get a hot pretzel.","Too bad. If itd been a friend, Im available to fill the void.  Its just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.,"Um, yeah but theyre all for little kids.",Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
Oh! I love trains!,"Uh, I guess. Theyre right over there by the wooden train set.",I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
"Oh my! Thats awfully sticky. Alright, lets see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. Its probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too.

Oh I do like monkeys!,Curious George.,Me too! Most people dont see it. What are you reading?
"Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?",Curious George is a monkey.,Oh I do like monkeys!
Im making friends with this little girl. Whats your name?,"Sheldon, what are you doing?",Okay.
"Hi Rebecca, Im your new friend, Sheldon.",Rebecca.,Im making friends with this little girl. Whats your name?
We were really hitting it off.,"No youre not, lets go.","Hi Rebecca, Im your new friend, Sheldon."
Oh good! Youre just in time. I believe Ive isolated the algorithm for making friends.,Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.,Lysine.
"See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.","Hear him out. If hes really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.","Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
Its a terrific book. Ive distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.,"Yes, hes new at the zoo.",Stu the cockatoo?
"Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadnt returned any of my calls because I hadnt offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together I see. Well then perhaps youd have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa I see. No, no, no, wait. Dont hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, Im sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.",Have you thought about putting him in a crate while youre out of the apartment?,Its a terrific book. Ive distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Its interesting. But isnt ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, thats brilliant! Im surprised you saw that.",I can fix it.,"Uh-oh, hes stuck in an infinite loop."
"Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, Ill pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.",Gee. Why cant Sheldon make friends?,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Its interesting. But isnt ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours.

He could talk while you drink."
"Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?","You afwaid of heights, Cooper?","This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
"Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.","Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.","Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
"Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said thats to be expected. Hey, this isnt so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.","Lets go, Cooper.","Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud."
I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.,"Hey, look at you, Cooper. Youre almost halfway to the top.","Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said thats to be expected. Hey, this isnt so bad. A bit like vertical swimming."
Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function thats approaching an asymptote.,"You alwight there, Cooper?",I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?,Are you saying youre stuck?,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function thats approaching an asymptote.

"Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.",Its a little thing but you really do miss it.,"Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and"
D-d-d! Thats where I sit.,He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.,How was rock climbing?
"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. Ive made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.","Sheldon, are you okay?",Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if Im gonna eat Chinese.
"Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, Im going to have to let one of you go.",Whats that?,"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. Ive made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."

"No. You, too, are safe.",Guilty as charged. Im out.,"Dont be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and youre not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays."
"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything youre saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, youre out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?",Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. Im not one of you guys. Im not a scientist. So just,Oh come on. What do I have to do?
"Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.",He had Lysine but changed it.,"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything youre saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, youre out.

"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if theres any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.","Suddenly Im looking pretty good, huh?","Yeah, its not a vewy hot name. Im gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers."
No? But were friends!,No.,"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if theres any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
Im confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?,"Im sowy. No, my fwiend?",No? But were friends!
"Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, youre back in. He likes monkeys.","No, thats wong. Theres an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.",Im confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
The problem appears to be unsolvable.,Hmmm.,He almost made it to the top this time.
"Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.","Weve got to be missing something. Lets start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.",There are too many variables. It would take forever.
"Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.","Why? Theyre state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.","Right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.,"Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add."
"Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow mornings bowel movement occurring at work.",We could eat after the movie.,"Well, its gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I dont see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre."
"Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?",Wow. I dont see how we missed that.,"Hang on, hang on. Theres a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here."
"Oh, Leonard, you know I cant do that.","Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?",Thats how we missed it.
"Theyre right, it was the only option.","Later, dude.",See ya.
Why?,"Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.","Theyre right, it was the only option."
"Well, you didnt specify.",Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.,Why?
"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. Im sorry, I dont understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?",Is Leonard around?,"Well, you didnt specify."

It was the only option. Im sorry, I dont understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
"If you recall, I pointed out the check engine light to you several months ago.",Its no big deal. Im just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.,"Oh, I see. Penny, Im not sure Im comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation."
"You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.",Well the check engine light is fine. Its still blinking away. Its the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.,"If you recall, I pointed out the check engine light to you several months ago."
Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.,"Yes, it occurs to me, too.","You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."

I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.,"Really?

I sincerely hope so.,Are they working on that?,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
Wont it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and youre living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?,"Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I cant. Sheldon honey, I dont want things to be weird between us.",I sincerely hope so.
Of course you will. Its impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.,Ill pay you back as soon as I can.,Wont it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and youre living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?

"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.",Why?,Of course. Thats how you move a conversation forward.
Was that sarcasm?,Great. I hope Im a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.,"Hey, Penny. How was work?"
Was that sarcasm?,No.,Was that sarcasm?
Was that sarca..,Yes.,Was that sarcasm?
"Penny, you appear to have a package here.",Stop it!,Was that sarca..
Did you know the beret is an example of piece of womens fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.,"Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.","Penny, you appear to have a package here."
All right.,"Okay, whatever. Its not like Im running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?","Hes not lying, he does find that fascinating."
"Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasnt sure.",Weird.,"Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?"
No.,Did you guys have an argument?,"Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasnt sure."
"Im at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if theres a blunder I overlooked.","Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.",No.
"Oh, good. Dinners here.","It was fourteen fifty, but its okay.","Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
Okay.,"Yes, dinners here, and Im having some. Im having takeout food.","Oh, good. Dinners here."
"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.","Youre damn right its okay. Ive been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.",Okay.

Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you dont.,I do.,"Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
"All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Pennys steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.",Im not afraid of him.,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you dont.
They did.,"Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didnt Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?","All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Pennys steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us."

Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.,"Guys, there are four of us and one of him.","Yes. Koothrappalis going to wet himself, Im gonna throw up, Sheldons gonna run away, and youre going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?"

I remember him.,"Sheldon, not now.",You dont remember me? How could he not remember me?
Ive got it. He didnt remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.,"No, the problem isnt solved. He just blew us off.",A successful quest. Now lets go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
"Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.",I dont need backup. I have right on my side. And Im wearing cargo shorts under my pants.,What happened to your backup?
"Hello, Penny.",Maybe if youre working on a tuna boat.,Its kind of a fashionable look these days.
Sarcasm?,"Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.","Hello, Penny."
Darn. I cant seem to get the hang of that.,No.,Sarcasm?
"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesnt seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because its his nature.",Bye.,"Nope. I just think hes really changed. Were having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys."
"Thats your badge of honour, your warriors wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.",Pennys hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!,"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesnt seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because its his nature."
"This should be fairly easy to deduce. Hes holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so hes using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.",Cant we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?,Not a clue.
"Hes referring to an activity he has done before. Its unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.","No, I didnt realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess theres no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.","This should be fairly easy to deduce. Hes holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so hes using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."

Its unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.,Ill start again.,Its cold.
That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.,"Oh, I dont know where he wouldve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.",I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.,"Yes, we think so. Weve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.",That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.,"Heres your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?","Well, its all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press."
Aw,"Im sorry, its on my other laptop.","Swell. If youre lucky, maybe shell show you the PowerPoint presentation."
What a remarkable woman.,His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
I envy you your childhood.,"Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.",What a remarkable woman.
"Youre clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and Im betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldnt eat your Brussels sprouts.","I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.",I envy you your childhood.
"You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.","Sheldon, you dont give your mother enough credit. Shes warm, shes loving, she doesnt glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.","Youre clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and Im betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldnt eat your Brussels sprouts."
"Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.","You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.",Why are you doing this?
"Its totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, its location, location, location.","Oh, the middle stall was occupied. Ill have to try again later.",That was fast.
Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one oclock.,"But its one oclock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one oclock.","Theres no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
You went to the comic book store without me.7,"You always say that, but we never do.",Well talk about this later.
I know. Although Ive always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.,Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.,My father used to borrow it.
Id love to see a scan of your brain sometime.,"Common complaint among men. Nothings ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.",I know. Although Ive always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
"Oh, I cant believe that.","Oh, Ill send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.",Id love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
My apologies. Ive been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.,Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.,"Oh, I cant believe that."
Can I make you a cup of tea?,Understandable.,My apologies. Ive been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
I feel very comfortable around you.,"I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, its probably you.",Can I make you a cup of tea?
"Its surprising because I generally dont feel comfortable around, well, anyone.","I feel very comfortable around you, too.",I feel very comfortable around you.
What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?,Nor I.,"Its surprising because I generally dont feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
Id like to do the math.,Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?,What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
"So, what do you think?","Right. Ah! Wheres the lime?  Oh, okay, were sharing.","Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime."
"Normally, Id feel the same way. But based on everything Ive observed about us, I cant help but speculate wed be very good together.",Im very tempted. Im just not sure its appropriate with my sons roommate.,"So, what do you think?"
"I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. Its quite satisfying.",True. Ive had a similar observation. Its certainly something I could never do with my husband.,"Normally, Id feel the same way. But based on everything Ive observed about us, I cant help but speculate wed be very good together."
"You see right through me, dont you?",I see what youre doing. Youre appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.,"I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. Its quite satisfying."
"The Pharmacology Department controls that, and theyre all hopped up on experimental steroids.",But what about the creek bed?,Theres no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.,"Well, thats it then, were doomed.","The Pharmacology Department controls that, and theyre all hopped up on experimental steroids."
And I told you I wanted to see a doctors note.,"I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.",I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earths Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.","No, that shouldnt be a problem, Venus is up during the day. Theyre probably just all staring at the sky.",No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
"Because you chose your mothers veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!",Why dont I run away and you cover me?,"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earths Athens and Sparta? Not important.

Unacceptable. It baffles me why they dont simply let some of you go so that theres money available for my research.,"Yeah, more cutbacks.",Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
"Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.","You know what baffles me, Sheldon?",Unacceptable. It baffles me why they dont simply let some of you go so that theres money available for my research.
I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.,"Yeah, okay, but whats with the back-scratching and the meow!","Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money."
"The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.",Thank you.,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
"No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now Im done.",Are you done?,"The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat."
Is that why you didnt cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?,In the paintball shed! Twice!,You and Leslie?
"My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.","Oh, yeah, sorry about that.",Is that why you didnt cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
"Hello, Penny.",How can I calm down? Im gonna lose my whole shopping cart. Thats three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.,Calm down. Well figure it out.
Youre in my spot.,"Hello, Sheldon.","Hello, Penny."
"No, Im going to the comic book store.",Are you planning on sitting here?,Youre in my spot.
What difference does it make?,Then what difference does it make?,"No, Im going to the comic book store."
"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.",Here we go.,What difference does it make?
Im not unhappy.,Fine.   Happy?,Dont sit in his spot.
Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?,Shh! Act normal.
Koothrappali picked me up.,"Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? Its a little chilly.",Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
They dont talk incessantly for no particular reason.,Isnt that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?,Koothrappali picked me up.
"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Somethings wrong.","Dont you dare, missy.","You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair."
Im not sure. It doesnt feel right.,What do you mean?,"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Somethings wrong."
Why dont I just eat in my desk chair?,Why dont you just eat in your desk chair?,"I dont know what youre talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that."
"That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I dont eat in my desk chair and I dont work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.",Here we go.,Why dont I just eat in my desk chair?
"Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dogs head in its place, would that be problem solved?","You know, theres kind of an obvious solution here.  Nobody cares where youre going to sit. Youre not crazy.",Wackadoodle.
"You claim its going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.","Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but its only for a week. Cant you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didnt really think that through.","If it were your head, it would be."
Did you notice the sign on his counter? Hes not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.,Why not?,"You claim its going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner."
"Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?","Oh, for Gods sake, Sheldon.",Did you notice the sign on his counter? Hes not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?,Why are you crouching there?,Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
"From that key maker, I highly doubt it.","Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.","Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new."
All right.,"Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.","From that key maker, I highly doubt it."
Theres one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.,"There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.",All right.
Nope.,Sit on the damn couch.,Theres one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
More?,"Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.",Its exactly the same

"But. Oh, this changes everything.","Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.","No. No, this isnt right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers."
Whats real? What isnt? How can I know?,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.,"But. Oh, this changes everything."
Leonard?,"Oh, God, I wish I had.","You did make that up, right?"
I still dont like this cushion.,"Yeah, buddy?",Leonard?
"Right, just one thing before we start.","Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then well all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.",Whats the plan?
That was for my cushion.,What the hell?,"What is it, Sheldon?"
"Im sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.","Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.",That was for my cushion.
She cant shoot me. Shes dead.,Screw that.,"Im sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold."
"Well, if were going to descend into anarchy",Hes right. You cant.,She cant shoot me. Shes dead.
"Stop. We cant do this, its not right.","Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.",Where are you going?
"But once you open the box, youve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant weve entered into with the manufacturer.

Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.","Stop. We cant do this, its not right."
There. Were outlaws.,"Okay, then we wont touch the hard drive. Well just erase the first season of Battlestar.","But once you open the box, youve voided the warranty.

"Were not flying, were taking the train.","Yeah, I wish.","Okay, now that Ive been completely insulted, have a good flight."
"Dont say it like that, Leonard, say it like: were taking the train!","Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so were taking the train.","Well, then why are you doing it?"
"Oh, I always enjoy that, but Im a little busy.","Hey, were all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?","Dont say it like that, Leonard, say it like: were taking the train!"

I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.",What are you doing?,"Oh, I always enjoy that, but Im a little busy."

"Unlikely. Thats a television show, Leonard.",Maybe John Connors aboard and shes protecting him from an evil Terminator.,It cant be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
"Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., thats Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

Its brilliant. He needs to read it.,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?,You dont understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.

"Thats preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Dont get me wrong, Im flattered, I just dont see it.",You got it.,C3PO.
"What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?","Leslie Winkle. Youve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.","Thats preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Dont get me wrong, Im flattered, I just dont see it."

I dont like this game.,Are you Spock?,"I believe its my turn, you may begin your questions whenever youre ready."
"I bet hes someone from Babylon 5, were never going to guess.",She dumped me!,"Okay, lets see. Are you from a TV series?"
I dont understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having what appears be an emotional response?,"I dont know. She just said Howard, mommas a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.","What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?"
"You know, Im given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.",I dont want to go anywhere.,"Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?"

"Thank you. Hello, neighbour.","Great, well bring you back a tee-shirt.",Id rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
And how are you doing this fine evening?,"Hello, Sheldon.","Thank you. Hello, neighbour."
Good. Im glad.,Great.,And how are you doing this fine evening?
"Im just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.",Really? Are you drunk?,Good. Im glad.
"Do you know, Im such a good mood, Im actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.","Thats Supermans big ice thing, right?","Im just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude."
"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, its main ingredient is Paneer, a farmers cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.","Mmm, what smells so good?","Do you know, Im such a good mood, Im actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today."

I left them in the bowl.,"So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.",We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.

"Sure, why not? And after the suns down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. Cause todays the day to stop making sense.","Yeah, why not?",Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
"So, how was your day?",Suppose it wouldnt hurt to get an estimate.,Im so lonely and horny I may open this 20 jar of peanuts and end it all.
"No, its the accepted convention. How was your day?","Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really dont have to.","So, how was your day?"
"Im sorry, thats not going to interest me at all, just eat.","Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different","No, its the accepted convention. How was your day?"
"Okay, thats question 20, you have to guess.","Uh, actually, if its not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.","Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
How can one person be a whole movie?,"Oh, God, I dont know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?","Okay, thats question 20, you have to guess."
Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.,"Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?",How can one person be a whole movie?
Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?,What?,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
"No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.","Where did that even come from, did he say we were?",Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
"Hmm, I see.","No, just mail, no benefits.","No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
"Im curious about the whole social construct.

Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.,"I dont think the managers coming tonight so, here.",Esther Rosenblatt.

"Okay, Im sleepy now, get out.","Oh, youre welcome sweetie.",Thank you for letting me stay here.
"Oh, good, youre finally home.","Okay, Im sleepy now, get out.","Oh, youre welcome sweetie."
"Smell that? Thats the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!",What were you doing at Pennys?,"Oh, good, youre finally home."
I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.,Is that supposed to be funny?,"Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go"
"Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.","Hes right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.","Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, Im the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology."

"Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.",No.,"Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?"
Youre not going to answer it?,Oh. Its Stuart.,"Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, thats why he works in a comic book store."
"Youre making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.",He wants to talk about Penny. I dont want to talk about Penny.,Youre not going to answer it?
"We dont know. And if you dont answer the phone, we cant know.",Why would he call me?,"Youre making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
"Answer the phone, Leonard.","Im not answering the phone, Sheldon.","We dont know. And if you dont answer the phone, we cant know."
Arent you going to check your messages?,"No! There, it went to voice mail.","Answer the phone, Leonard."

But the mission is for six months.,Its gonna fail after about ten flushes.,How teeny tiny?
Have you notified NASA?,"Yeah, see, thats the code red. Its kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.",But the mission is for six months.
I agree. Its the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.,"Im trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.","Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive."
"Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.",You mean so it doesnt hit the fan?,"Yeah, ha, its hilarious. Now, heres an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
"For what its worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.",It wasnt bad advice. It just wasnt particularly helpful.,"Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty."
"All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?","For what its worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.",It wasnt bad advice. It just wasnt particularly helpful.
"You dont really believe in that superstition, do you?","Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.",I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuarts date with Penny.
It wont work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.,"Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?",Speaking of what goes around comes around
It wont work. No way to mount it.,What if we reposition the collection tank?,It wont work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
That could work.,"Okay, heres an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?",It wont work. No way to mount it.
Youre overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure youre building.,"Hang on, I think Ive got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.","If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin latte."
"If you knew what you were doing, there wouldnt be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.","Sheldon, I know what Im doing.",Youre overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure youre building.
"Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.",Comic book store.,Where are you going?
Why does Leonard get to go?,"Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.","Me, too."
"I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your masters degree.","Damn right its heavy, its my mothers meat loaf, its been testing toilets for generations.","Wow, thats heavy."
Fascinating.,"Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one.","I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your masters degree."

"Oh, boy.","ISS, Im afraid we cant authorize that.","Houston, wed all like to step outside for a few minutes."
I cant comment without violating our agreement that I dont criticize your work.,What?,"Oh, boy."
Great restraint on my part.,"Then what was oh, boy?",I cant comment without violating our agreement that I dont criticize your work.
Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.,Theres nothing wrong with the science here.,Great restraint on my part.
"You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, youve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now heres a peculiar e-mail.

"Thats 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, Im effectively one of Heisenbergs particles, I know where I am or I know how fast Im going, but I cant know both.

"Of course not. Im a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because its indoors, but if Im able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory.

"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.","Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?",Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
It wasnt. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.,How was it resolved?,"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question."

"All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.","Yes, obviously.","Oh, thats clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
She does have a short attention span.,"Yes, okay, but Im gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesnt miss me that long and she meets someone else?","All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.","So, I cant go.",She does have a short attention span.
"Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, Ive managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!",You really think so?,"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
"All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.",Were out of ice.,What?
It is remarkable.,"Yeah, wow.",Hes right.
What are we having?,Dinners ready!,I say double feature.
Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?,Reconstituted Thai food.,What are we having?
Freeze-dried spicy mustard?,Check.,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
"Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?",Check.,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! Youre in my spot.,"Uh, oh, sorry.","Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
"I dont know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.",It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.,I cant believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you Id call you when I got home, Im not home yet.  Alright, Im home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, Im all but certain theres a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldnt say that. Im entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that Im home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, Im not sassing you in Eskimo talk.","I dont know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.",It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
"Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye.  Daddys home.",Im going to go let Penny know were back.,"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you Id call you when I got home, Im not home yet.  Alright, Im home.

No, Im not sassing you in Eskimo talk."
"I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I wont forget your contributions.","Yeah, it was first come, first served.","Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back."
"Of course, I cant mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.",Thanks.,Great.
Tell me what?,We have to tell him.,"Of course, I cant mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
"You fellows are planning a party for me, arent you?",Damn his Vulcan hearing.,Tell me what?
"If theres going to be a theme, I should let you know that I dont care for luau, toga or under the sea.","Okay, Sheldon, sit down.","You fellows are planning a party for me, arent you?"
"If this is about the night the heat went out, theres nothing to be embarrassed about.","Yeah, well keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.","If theres going to be a theme, I should let you know that I dont care for luau, toga or under the sea."
So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.,And we agreed to never speak of it again.,Its not about that.
"Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.","Thats why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.",I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
You tampered with my experiment?,"He just went colon, capital O.","Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasnt so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
Did Leonard know about this? Leonards my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didnt know.,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.,We had to.
Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.,"Actually, it was his idea.",Did Leonard know about this? Leonards my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didnt know.
Leonard.,"Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, its dont ask.",I couldnt even think of anyone else while you were gone.
Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.,Do not make a sound.,Leonard.
Penny.,"Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.",Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
"Hello, Penny. I realize youre currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?","Oh, this is ridiculous. What?",Penny.
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?,Its great to see you too. Come on in.,"Hello, Penny. I realize youre currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?"
"Whats going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.","Okay, can someone please tell me whats going on here?","Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I dont expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
That seems like a bit of an overreaction.,"Because when he wasnt happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.",Why did you have to make him happy?
"Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and Ive already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed mans understanding of the universe.","No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.",That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
"Youre right, Leonard, its not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal","Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldnt have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, its no big deal.","Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and Ive already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed mans understanding of the universe."
About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didnt even get to go to Comic-Con!,Hey. Do you want to talk?,"Man, I cannot catch a break."
Thats for when Im sick. Sad is not sick.,"Oh, hon Uh   Soft kitty, warm kitty",About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didnt even get to go to Comic-Con!
I dont have a sad song. Im not a child.,Oh. Sorry. I dont know your sad song.,Thats for when Im sick. Sad is not sick.
Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?,"Well, you know, I do understand what youre going through.",I dont have a sad song. Im not a child.
Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?,"Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol slutbag.",Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
"And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?","Well, theyre pretty tasty.",Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!,"Look, Sheldon, I just dont think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what its like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasnt true, like saying Spock didnt care his mom died?","And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.","Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?",I feel bad for the guy.
Its going to take more than Im sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what youve done to me.,Come on. We said we were sorry.,"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated."
You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.,"Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.",Its going to take more than Im sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what youve done to me.
"All right, Ive had enough. Attention, everyone. I m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.",Thats not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.,You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.

There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That mans name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.",Compwetely wecked.,My credibility may have been damaged
"Oh, you think youre so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.","Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einsteins cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so youre still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.","But I would like to remind you that in science, theres no such thing as failure.

Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.,Whatever. Jesus still loves you.,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
Theyre not my friends.,"Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend hes Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?",Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know thats why they hated me.,"All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.",Theyre not my friends.
What are they doing here?,"Oh, good. Ive been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.","Uh, yes, maam."

"Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Dont you think if I were wrong, Id know it?","Sheldon, youre wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.",Totally.
Im not crazy. My mother had me tested.,"Give it up, dude, youre arguing with a crazy person.","Okay, first of all"
I did.,"Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours?","Theres more to life than sex, Raj."
Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.,"Whats there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.",Its not a matter of opportunity. Were getting to know each other. Theres a learning curve.
"Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.","Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?",Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.

I know. As Im sure youre aware,I dont know,What are they talking about?

So what youre seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.",Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.,I know. As Im sure youre aware
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.,"Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?","Okay, yeah, well, Im just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside."
"Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Pennys sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat.","Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonards got one and you dont.","No, youre misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isnt an actual goddess and we dont pray to them, we prey on them."
"Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.",Sounds like a cricket.,Whats that?
"In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.","Oh, give me a frickin break. How could you possibly know that?","Hang on.

That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.,"Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.","No, no, not this time.

"Theres just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You werent happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner.

I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think Im doing?,"How ya doin, buddy?","Dont remind me!  Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go."
What do you want?,"Come on, it wasnt that bad.",I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think Im doing?
It wasnt funny.,"Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.","We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you."
Did you laugh?,You laughed.,Raj.
I refuse to sink to his level.,"I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.",Did you laugh?
I never admit defeat.,Are you really admitting defeat?,"You cant sink. With all that helium in you, youre lucky you dont float away."
"However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.",Good.,I never admit defeat.
"Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.","Thats true. He didnt just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gothams water supply.","Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane."
Its a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals thatd be untraceable in an autopsy.,"No, no.","Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? Hell sit down, itll sound like hes flatulent, even though hes not.","Okay, uh, thats the spirit, but, um, lets dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.",Its a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals thatd be untraceable in an autopsy.
"All right, hows this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.",Wow.,Dont you just hate when this happens?
"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, were going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.",Whats this?,"All right, hows this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
"Yes, exactly.",Foamy vengeance.,"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, were going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripkes lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitors shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.","This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripkes office?","Yes, exactly."
"You flatter me, sir.","Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.","Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripkes lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitors shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
"The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.","Let me guess, motion sensors?","You flatter me, sir."
"It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.","I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.","The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha."
There is no abort.,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!,I believe thats the president of the university.
"I made a boo-boo, all right?","Well, how could you not put in an abort?",There is no abort.
"Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If youd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.",At least they dont know it was you.,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
"Leonard, shes doing it again.","Hey, Leonard, check this out.",Are you kidding? Thats the most romantic thing anyones ever done for me.
No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.,I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.,"Leonard, shes doing it again."
Leonard.,You want me to put it back?,No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
Hello.,"Whats up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.",It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
"Wait, no, thats a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, wed be suffocating.","Sure. The more, the merrier.","I hope its all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner."
"Dont Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.",Sheldon,"Wait, no, thats a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, wed be suffocating."
"Oh, sure. And while were at it, why dont we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?","Oh, come on, its fine. Well just put it all on the table, you know, family style.","Dont Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six."
Perhaps theres hope for you after all.,"Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that hes warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, its directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isnt direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.",He cant sit somewhere else?
My mother was right. Hell is real.,"Oh, great selection, great prices.",Ive been meaning to go over there.
"Yes. Leonards work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, Im uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.",Thats amazing.,"Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, were testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
Howard?,"Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.","Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?,Yeah?,Howard?
Bazinga. I dont care.,What?,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
Thats not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.,"Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.",Bazinga. I dont care.
Just need a little more practice.,"And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether its a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you cant drive.",Thats not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
"Its not about shoes, is it? I dont think I could go through that again.","Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?","What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart."
Then speak.,Its not about shoes.,"Its not about shoes, is it? I dont think I could go through that again."
"All right.  Go away. I agree, its rude, but she asked for privacy.","Um, actually, can we do it in private?",Then speak.
"A little physics? Theres no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.","Thanks, Raj. Okay, so heres the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?","All right.  Go away. I agree, its rude, but she asked for privacy."
Why cant Leonard teach you?,"Yeah, okay, cool. I dont need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.","A little physics? Theres no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
"Cant you surprise him in some other way? For example, Im sure hed be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.",Cause I want to surprise him.,Why cant Leonard teach you?
"Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.","Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.","Cant you surprise him in some other way? For example, Im sure hed be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?",Youre sitting here playing video games all day.,"Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
The one with the frogs.,Sure. I did the one with the frogs.,"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?"
"Im sorry, Penny, I dont think so.","Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.",The one with the frogs.
"Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.","Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, itll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.","Im sorry, Penny, I dont think so."
"Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.","Great! Its a little insulting, but great. Ill be KoKo.","Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics."
"Research journal, entry one. Im about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. Im calling it Project Gorilla.",I believe you.,"I hope not, because you dont want to mess with me. Im crazy."
Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. Ive extended a friendly casual greeting.,"Hey, Sheldon.","Research journal, entry one. Im about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. Im calling it Project Gorilla."
"One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Wheres your notebook?",Ready to get started?,Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. Ive extended a friendly casual greeting.
How are you going to take notes without a notebook?,"Um, I dont have one.","One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Wheres your notebook?"
How else are you gonna study for the tests?,I have to take notes?,How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
Tests. Here. Its college-ruled. I hope thats not too intimidating.,Theres gonna be a test?,How else are you gonna study for the tests?
"Youre welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. Its at this point that youll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.",Thank you.,Tests. Here. Its college-ruled. I hope thats not too intimidating.
"Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. Its a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, youve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky.

This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey were going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.,"Um, does this have anything to do with Leonards work?","Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. Its a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, youve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky.

Cant you hold it?,I have to go to the bathroom.,"Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, its a warm summer evening in ancient Greece Yes, Penny?"
"Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.",Not for twenty six hundred years.,Cant you hold it?
"Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So lets plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?","I didnt say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I dont want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.",Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
"No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Dont write that down!","Uh, we know that Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?","Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion.

"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?",Sorry.,"No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Dont write that down!"
How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?,I dont know.,"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?"
Im sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?,Hey! You dont have to be so mean!,How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
"Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?","No, you just suck at teaching.",Im sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
All right. Its a warm summer evening in ancient Greece,"Oh, God, Sheldon, look Im trying to understand, but youre going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?","Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?,Not that far back!,All right. Its a warm summer evening in ancient Greece
Greece.,I dont know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?,Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?

No.,Squared?,"Theres no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which? MA equals MG?"
No.,Aristotle?,No.
Oh!,Five?,No.
Why are you crying?,Then I dont know.,Oh!
"Thats no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.",Because Im stupid!,Why are you crying?
All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.,"Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?","Thats no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
Its not. Thats why Leonard does it.,"Really? Thats it? Well, that doesnt sound so complicated.",All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
A good question.,"Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?",Its not. Thats why Leonard does it.
"And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?",Thank you.,A good question.
Its a warm summer evening in ancient Greece,"Oh, balls.","And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.","Oh, I always tear up when the Grinchs heart grows three sizes.",Im glad you enjoyed it. Most people arent that interested in what I do.
"No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.","You really didnt like it, Sheldon?","Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la."
"Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.","When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.","No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas.

"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.","Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?","Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.,So I take it you dont want to help us trim the tree.,"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

"Youre kidding, right? Its a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.",What is it?,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
"Wait, excuse me, but its much more Christmassy than anything youve put on the tree.","Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.","Youre kidding, right? Its a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."
"December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.",Here we go.,"Wait, excuse me, but its much more Christmassy than anything youve put on the tree."
"I sense thats not sincere, although I have no idea why.","Merry Newton-mas, everyone.","December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born.

No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.,"No, its fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.","I sense thats not sincere, although I have no idea why."
I understand. You dispute Newtons claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.,"No, he doesnt.",No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
"Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, shell talk some sense into you.","Yeah, you got me. Im a Leibniz man.",I understand. You dispute Newtons claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
"If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother wont approve of you as his mate.","Well, I just, I thought",Why were you keeping this a secret?
"If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that its doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.","You are, its just",Why wouldnt she approve of me? Im adorable.
"Leonard, Im no expert on meditation, but if youre trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.",Um,Why not?
No trouble at all.,It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.,"Leonard, Im no expert on meditation, but if youre trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om."
"My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brains water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.","Yes, dear. Mommys proud. Ive been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.","I drove, Mother. Im driving now."
August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.,"Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?","My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brains water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate."
You did.,"Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?",August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
"Neither do I, but its the social convention.",I dont really like flowers.,You did.
Its what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.,"Well, I would assume its because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.",I just dont understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.,"No. Sheldon, why didnt you tell me?",Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?
"Well, Im not sure about interesting, but","Why? Im not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?",You must be very happy.
Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?,"Not the time, Sheldon.","Well, Im not sure about interesting, but"
"Isnt she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.","Its all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonards not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.",Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
September 22nd.,"Mmm, well, lets see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonards father?",When did this happen?
"She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?",Mitzys dead?,"Oh, yes, thats right. The weekend after Leonards dog died."
Leonard?,"I do, Ill teach you.","Oh, I dont drink."
I made tea.,What is it?,Leonard?
I didnt make tea for you. This is my tea.,I dont want tea.,I made tea.
Its a conversation starter.,Then why are you telling me?,I didnt make tea for you. This is my tea.
"Oh, is it? Were conversing. Checkmate.",Thats a lousy conversation starter.,Its a conversation starter.
What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.,"What do you want, Sheldon?","Oh, is it? Were conversing. Checkmate."
"To comfort you, of course. No, thats not going to work at all, Ill comfort you from over here.

Leonard, what youre experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
"No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what youre feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.",Its not?,Thats not the comforting part.
"Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.","Youre right, I do feel better.","No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what youre feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."

Youre very welcome.,Thank you for taking me to the airport.,"Speaking of warm feelings, come here.  No, Id rather have the busboy."
I dont blame you. You were intoxicated.,"Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope youll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.","Once again, Im driving. Im right here."
I blame Penny.,Thank you.,I dont blame you. You were intoxicated.
Agreed.,I think its best that you not know.,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"
I dont understand. What other kind of women are there?,"Yes, actual women are the best.",Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge theyre our girlfriends.

"It is great, isnt it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.","Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?",How did we get actual women?

"Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says aprs supercollider?","Sheldon, you got a minute?","Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?","Sheldon, Im not taking you to Switzerland.","Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says aprs supercollider?"
What? Thats absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,Penny.,"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?"
But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,"Yes, but itll be Valentines Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.",What? Thats absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Sorry? Ive been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.,"Im sorry, Sheldon.",But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.

"Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.","Oh, my God, Leonard! Thats incredible!","Well, youll ski, Ill fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentines Day."

Do you recognize this?
"He cant kill me, even if I turn.","Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.",You actually put that in an agreement?
"No, that seemed a little farfetched.",Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?,"He cant kill me, even if I turn."
"Ive lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply dont care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.","Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?","No, that seemed a little farfetched."
Id be much further along if Id been allowed to practice.,No.,"Okay, I know I shouldnt ask, but what is?"

"Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.","Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and its Penny, not you!","Yes, that good news."

That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.",Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?,Sweet.
"Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.","Oh, no, you didnt trade the food for magic beans, did you?","Dont panic, this is better."
"Whos Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?",Whos Adam West?,"We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him."

Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.","Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?","So, I was doing some checking on the ring."

Ow! You hit me! Im bleeding!,How am I looking now?,"If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, youd have my great Aunt Idas brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat."
"Its not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only Id had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then Id have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.","So, Sheldon, hows it feel to get beaten up by a girl?",Thats my girl.
You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public mens room.,"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didnt want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. Im sending it back. Wheres the ring?","Okay, just so you know, if were bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
"No, its mine.",Give me that.,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public mens room.
I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.,And it wasnt when we were driving like this?,"You know, theres a point when this becomes idiotic."
"Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why dont you go after Rajs mother?","If youre offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mothers boobies.",Dont you talk about my mothers boobies!
"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything youd like to add?",Why dont we go after your mother?,"Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why dont you go after Rajs mother?"
No! I call no Meemaws.,Youre right. Lets talk about your grandmother.,Thats not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
I dont want to hear this.,Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.,No! I call no Meemaws.
Never.,Then let go of the ring and walk away.,I dont want to hear this.
Stop it!,All right. Ill bet your Meemaw didnt just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.,Never.
I said stop it!,"Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.",Stop it!
Waterfalls!,Were getting to him.,I said stop it!
Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.,What?,Waterfalls!
Subliminal messaging. Im going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.,What are you doing?,Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
"Oh-ho-ho, its working all right. I have to pee.","Its, its not working, dude.",Subliminal messaging. Im going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?","Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two","No, actually, I wouldnt mind going, too."
Excellent choice.,We stand up.,"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
Ive done it! Ive won! The ring is mine! Its mine!  Wheres the ring?,Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.,Three.
I knew it. Give us the precious!,"There wasnt ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? Cause if it is, fine, I dont want anything to do with you. And I dont know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious.","Well, so then we start the game over until theres a winner."
"It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasnt William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?","My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, Id be very nervous around James Cameron.",Whats your point?
"And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, Ill play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?","Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this years Chancellors Award for Science.","It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about.

I won?,"Oh, Im so glad you asked it like that. You.","And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, Ill play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. Its not astonishing, more like inevitable. Im not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, Im going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.",You won.,I won?
"Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.","Hey, you didnt want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you dont get glasses.",No.
"Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  Problem.","Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.","Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please."
They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I cant give a speech.,What?,"Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  Problem."
I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.,"Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.","Well, no, youre mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you cant do is shut up."
Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.,"What, to you, is a large crowd?",I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
Im not accepting the award.,"Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.",Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
"Thank you. Yeah, Ill bear that in mind if Im ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.","Thats no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queens court.",Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
Am I? Let me tell you a story.,"Sheldon, youre being ridiculous.","Thank you. Yeah, Ill bear that in mind if Im ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."
I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.,Wheres 70 children when you need em?,Am I? Let me tell you a story.
"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it oh, dear.",I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.,I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
Dont trample me.,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?","Oh, my God."
"Come on, Mother, you know why I cant accept the award. With all due respect, I dont think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you dont need to start singing it. Yes, Ill buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother.  Hello.",Dont trample me.,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?,"Sit down, we want to talk to you.","Come on, Mother, you know why I cant accept the award. With all due respect, I dont think praying will help.

"Oh, I doubt that. I havent figured out a way, and Im much smarter than all of you.",We think we can help you with your stage fright.,Just sit.
"Oh, Im sorry, that is what I meant.","Yes, but youre not smarter than all of us put together.","Oh, I doubt that. I havent figured out a way, and Im much smarter than all of you."
I do like the X-Men.,"We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.","Okay, your problem is, youre trying to do this all by yourself."
"I dont know. If youre my X-Men, what are your powers?","Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?","Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it."
"Thats not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?","Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.","I dont know. If youre my X-Men, what are your powers?"
What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.,"Thats not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?"
"I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, youre saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.","Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I dont know, some Indian meditation crap.","My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and Ive been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
And I appreciate the pretence.,"My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And thats 24-7, buddy.","I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, youre saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me."
"No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.","So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?",And I appreciate the pretence.
"And yet, you cant speak to women.","Okay, Sheldon. Im going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.","Oh, thats not a good name."
"Okay, but dont punch me.","True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.","And yet, you cant speak to women."
"When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, youll get a surprise, and then shed punch me.",What?,"Okay, but dont punch me."
Thats what my sister used to say.,Im not going to punch you.,"When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, youll get a surprise, and then shed punch me."
Im sorry. Proceed.,Do you want to do this or not?,Thats what my sister used to say.
"Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.",All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?,Im sorry. Proceed.
"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?","Okay, youre in Sheldonopolis.","Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis."
I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.,Whatever you like.,"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?"
Really? This time of year? Its a bit nippy.,Fine. Youre in Sheldon Square.,I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.,"Then, put on a sweater.",Really? This time of year? Its a bit nippy.
"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15 discount.","Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.",Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
"Look, I didnt turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.",You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!,"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15 discount."
"Hang on. Its a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.","All right. Youve paid for a sweater, and youre in Sheldon Square.","Look, I didnt turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children cant run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.",What now?,"Hang on. Its a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?,"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children cant run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected.

Its only one colour.,"Yeah, thats when I buy shoes. Now, lets see what weve got. Ooh! This is nice.",Dont you eventually realize youre just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
Thats a lot of money for only one colour.,"Yeah, so?",Its only one colour.
Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.,Fine. Why dont you pick out what you like.,Thats a lot of money for only one colour.
In the prom department.,Where the hell dyou find that?,"No, youre wrong."
Says the former member of the Corn Queens Court.,Its ridiculous.,In the prom department.
Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.,Please just try this one on.,Says the former member of the Corn Queens Court.
"Thats how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralphs.","So, Sheldon, how you doing?",Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.
Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?,"Im sorry, Ill start again.","Thats how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing?

I was wearing size a million pants.,How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?,"I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
"Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.",Why dont we just talk?,I was wearing size a million pants.
"Really, Leonard? Youre just going to try to recycle Adlers doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralphs.

And how did that make you feel?,"But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music. But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brothers earlier Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock n Roll. I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.","Really, Leonard? Youre just going to try to recycle Adlers doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralphs. And shed let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
Go on.,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clowns aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.,And how did that make you feel?
"So, I hear you saying youre angry with your mother.",It wasnt my fault. I had never seen my brothers project. And my mother couldve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.,Go on.
"Thank you, Leonard.","Damn right, Im angry with my mother. For Gods sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. Thats when the bed-wetting started again.","So, I hear you saying youre angry with your mother."
"If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.",For what?,"Thank you, Leonard."
"Oh, dear.","Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this years Chancellors award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

"I dont feel different, this alcohols defective.","Fine, faint.",Alcohol? I dont drink alcohol.
Im ready.,"First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didnt hear me. If youd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, Id like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.","Here, see if this one works."
"Thanks, shorty,Ill take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology?

"This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer.

Make it so.,Preparing to fire laser at the moon.,"Cool, its gonna be in 3-D?"
I was wrong. Penny can do better.,What species is that?,"Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
He must be very skilled at coitus.,"No, just keep walking.","Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?"

"As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.","All right, you can have a hot chocolate.",I dont drink coffee.
Whats life without whimsy?,Why?,"As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them."
Youre bluffing.,"Sheldon, Ive hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.","Okay, Im out."
Curse you.,Are you willing to risk it?,Youre bluffing.
"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?",Im really starting to think theres a double standard here.,Are you out of your mind?!
Haughty derision it is.,You dont know were wrong yet.,"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"

"Yes, Penny.","Okay, I have a question.",Im guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
Why on Earth would we have sex?,You dont even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?,"Yes, Penny."
"Im quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.","Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?",Why on Earth would we have sex?
"Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?","Oh, God.","Im quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."

I cant date Amy.,Yeah.,You mean dating?
Shes not my girlfriend.,Why not?,I cant date Amy.
Oh. I hadnt considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you dont think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?,"Okay, look, dont think of it as dating a girlfriend.

Wait. You have to drive me.,"Oh, thats great. Have fun.",Ive decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
You know I dont drive.,What?,Wait. You have to drive me.
"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.","Well, go ask Leonard.",You know I dont drive.
"Actually, Im paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, Im uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, Im not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.",Leonard said cockamamie?,"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
Now.,"Okay, fine. Whens the date?","Actually, Im paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, Im uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, Im not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
Hurry. Were going to be late.,Now?,Now.
Im sorry. Do you have other plans?,"Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?",Hurry. Were going to be late.
So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?,"Well, no, not per se, but",Im sorry. Do you have other plans?
Thank you for driving me.,"Ill eat later. Im busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.","Howard, dinners ready!"
I wish you werent wearing flip-flops. Its dangerous to drive in flip-flops.,Youre welcome.,Thank you for driving me.
Sorry. I just dont want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.,Sheldon.,I wish you werent wearing flip-flops. Its dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
"Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.",Can I ask you a question?,Sorry. I just dont want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?,"Yeah. Well, my question is, and Im pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?","Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
"Then, this is my first date.",No.,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
"I have a masters degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.","Okay. Well, then, theres a couple of things you should probably know.","Then, this is my first date."
"If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?","My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.","I have a masters degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know."
Dont bother. Ive wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.,But the light indicates,"Yeah, its okay."
"Oh, no, I wouldnt care for that. Amy?","Guys, how bout some music?",Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
No.,"Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?","No, thank you."
All right. It was hell.,"Well, why dont you tell her?",No.
"Im sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?","I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.",No.
Muggles.,I dont know. I was just trying something.,"Im sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. Its over 14 hours in Southern California.,"Hey, heres another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?","Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch."
Thank you.,Thats an amusing factoid.,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. Its over 14 hours in Southern California.
"Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didnt count.",Is this true?,"No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldons first official date. Discuss."
Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.,"Uh, yeah, I wouldnt say many. A few.","Once a year. Its a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?"
"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that Ive known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15",What? Where did you get 171 men?,Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
Im sorry. 16?,"Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.","Simple extrapolation. In the three years that Ive known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15"
"My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.",14.,Im sorry. 16?
Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.,No.,Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
"Based on the number of awkward encounters Ive had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times shes returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before",Oh.,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
"So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Lets round that up to 31.","Okay, Sheldon, I think youve made your point.","Based on the number of awkward encounters Ive had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times shes returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before"
This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?,"No! No! No. Lets just all finish our dinners, okay?","This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?"
I should think so.,Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?,This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?

"Youve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so Ive provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldnt have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.",What alibi?,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
"The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.","Oh, Im so sure Im going to regret this, but, who was I with?","Youve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so Ive provided you with an iron clad alibi.

"You met her at Pasadenas most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwins, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.","Oh, God.","The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary."
And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.,"Leonard, call me if youre interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.","You met her at Pasadenas most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwins, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
Top of the morning to you. Youve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.,"Leonard, call me if youre interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary."
"Its pretty convincing, huh? And it wasnt even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggies flaming auburn hair.",Top of the morning to you. Youve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.,Where did you get that?,"Its pretty convincing, huh? And it wasnt even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggies flaming auburn hair."
"Well, no-ones going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.",An orang-u-tan?,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priyas preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.","Cmon Raj, how am I supposed to know who shes attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.","Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sisters never been attracted to him."

"Sure you can, youre doing fine, its very believable.",As a matter of fact I.. I I cant I cant I cant do it.,"Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
"Dont listen to him, hes still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.","Look, Im sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.","Sure you can, youre doing fine, its very believable."
"I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?",What were you doing with Priya?,"Dont listen to him, hes still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
"May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.","Excuse me, I think how could you shes my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!",How could you? We had a pact!
I think a more amusing violation of Rajs trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.,Dude! I put that thing on my face!,Was it out of respect that you didnt tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
"Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.","And as long as were talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonards food.",That was all a lie? This years gifts are already wrapped!
For science.,You put moths in my food?,"Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."

"Excuse me. If were changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.",Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.,Where are we going?
"You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.",Nobody cares. Do you know how long its been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?,"Dont be ridiculous, Raj. Youre here legally."
"No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.","Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.","You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."

"Dont tell him that, tell him the mask thing.","Sheldon, its Saturday night, youll be doing laundry.",Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
"And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.",Its Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.,"All right, Dr. Kooth uh, whatever it is, youre up."
"Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and Im not above minimizing your window.","Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think youve made a foolish mistake.","And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites."
Thats it.

But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and Im not above minimizing your window."
Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?,"Im not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?",Thats it. Prepare to be minimized.
"Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.","Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.",Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
Are you trying to scare me? Cause youre succeeding.,"And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.","Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page."
"Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!","Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this years donations might go to, say, the geology department.",Are you trying to scare me? Cause youre succeeding.
No!,"Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.","Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"

"I must confess I dont understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers.

"My stature intimidates her, so shes using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.",What?,"Okay, I see whats happening."
"No, that cant be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is were best friends. And I got your back, Jack.","Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment.

"You know, its a shame, all that work shes doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.","Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.","Im sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?"

Excellent! What are you planning to wear?,"I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.","Youre really a broken toy, arent you?"

"Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!","Good night, Sheldon.","Oh, come on! Why not?"
No. But thank you for asking.,"He still wont shag the old lady, huh?","Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"

"Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.","No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.","Again, read the book we gave you."

"Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.",No.,Did you offer him a hot beverage?
"You heard the man, Leonard. And while youre at it, Im upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didnt you seek refuge under his roof?",Tea does sound nice.,"Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
"Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. Im down in the dumps here.","Wait, wait. What?",Theres no room. His sister is staying with him.
"Dont worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.","Yeah, thats a real pickle. Bye.","I dont know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesnt like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesnt trust Bernadette."

Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because youre welcome to.,"Its completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private.

"Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.","Thats very nice of you, but I made other plans.",Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because youre welcome to.
Hello.,Hey.,"Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon."
"Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a womans father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.","Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you dont get to tell me who I can and cant have a relationship with.",Are you sure? That doesnt sound right.
"Priya, if youre experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.","Oh, yeah, you, too.",Its very nice to meet you.
"Thats remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nations airports.","Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.",All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
"No, no. Its not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.","Oh, yes. Hi, hi. Im sorry. I didnt know you had company. I dont want to impose.","Hi. Penny, right?"
Did you get the part?,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Its real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.","So, Penny, Leonard tells me youre an actress. That must be pretty exciting."
"Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?",I didnt do the audition.,Did you get the part?
Its actually Thai. Youre slipping.,I smell Chinese food.,Okay.
They went to Catalina for the weekend.,Are Leonard and Priya here?,Its actually Thai. Youre slipping.
"At home, forbidding it.",Oh. Wheres Raj?,They went to Catalina for the weekend.
Im given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.,How about Howard?,"At home, forbidding it."
"Actually, its the three of us.","Oh, okay. Well, I guess its just the two of us, huh?",Im given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
Right. Ill make tea.,"Sheldon, you have a guest whos upset.",Not really.
"Buona sera, Luigis Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?","Oh, sweetie, its okay. I dont want tea.",Right. Ill make tea.
"Un momento. Oh, for heavens sake, now youre being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?","Okay, Im out of here.","Buona sera, Luigis Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
"But tonights Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza.

"We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.",Cant we make a one-time exception for tonight?,"But tonights Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan."
"Well, I dont want to go to a party.",Just come with me to Rajs.,"We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic."
"Im sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.","Its not a party. Its the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.","Well, I dont want to go to a party."
Because we dont throw parties.,How come its not a party when we do it here?,"Im sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.","I dont know what to tell you, Sheldon. Im going to see Priya. Everyones over there. You coming or not?",Because we dont throw parties.
Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?,I guess youre right. See you later.,"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition.

But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
I cant do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?,Come with me to Rajs and eat there.,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
"But what if he does? Ill be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheeps stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I dont know why hes serving both.",I really doubt thats what hell serve.,I cant do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
"No, Ill go to your haggis party. But Im telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.","What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?","But what if he does? Ill be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheeps stomach.

"Oh, dear!","No, Ill go to your haggis party. But Im telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.","What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
Rajs television. I just realized were about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.,What?,"Oh, dear!"
"And be a social pariah? Oh, you know thats not my style.",So dont watch TV. Read a book.,Rajs television. I just realized were about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
"The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?",Ugh!,"And be a social pariah? Oh, you know thats not my style."
Is it about me or the dead pixels?,Right.,"The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
"Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.","Oh, sounds great.","Hey, youre just in time. We made Tex-Mex."
"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.","Thats got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sisters mouth?",Hi.
"Oh, what fun. Were like hippies at a love-in.","There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.","Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
"Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, its Harry Potter and 98 of The Sorcerers Stone.",Just sit here.,"Oh, what fun. Were like hippies at a love-in."
"Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.","Okay, weve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.","Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, its Harry Potter and 98 of The Sorcerers Stone."
A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?,"Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?","Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required."
Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?",A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.",Where are all your friends?,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
Excuse me? Isnt this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?,Okay.,"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
"I dont think your hearts in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Rajs sister, were all forced to hang out at his apartment.","Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. Whats troubling you, buddy?",Excuse me? Isnt this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
"Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?","Oh, the horror.","I dont think your hearts in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Rajs sister, were all forced to hang out at his apartment."

"Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didnt look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.","Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Rajs, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.",Wonder what shes exasperated about. Hello?
Dont worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.,"Yeah, its a great time to be alive, isnt it?","Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose."
Cluck-cluck-cluck.,Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.,"Okay, Im not upset about Leonard and Priya."
Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. Im the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.,"Sheldon, look at me. I think its time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.",Cluck-cluck-cluck.
Im setting out snacks.,What you doing?,So needy.
"I didnt say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?",You do realize everyones eating at Rajs again tonight?,Im setting out snacks.
"Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, Ill tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Pennys ex-boyfriend Zack and TVs LeVar Burton.",Youre having people over?,"I didnt say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?"

"Dont make this harder than it is, Leonard.",I am leaving.,Okay. I have guests coming. Im afraid Im going to have to ask you to leave now.
"And good-bye to you, sir. Hell be back.","Good-bye, Sheldon.","Dont make this harder than it is, Leonard."
"Well, it would appear LeVar Burton wont be joining us so lets get started. Um, I thought wed begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why were here. Okay. Im Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If youre not familiar with that publication, theres a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?",Of course Ill be back. I live here!,"And good-bye to you, sir. Hell be back."
"Thats very nice, Stuart. Zack?","Um. Hi. Im Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, Im currently living in. And I guess what Im hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.","Well, it would appear LeVar Burton wont be joining us so lets get started.

"Yes, you must be present to win.",One more question,"Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?,"Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. Theres no one around, so naturally, Im free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.","If youd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldnt have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber."
"Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.",Whats the difference?,Weally? Thats your question?
"Surprisingly, yes.","Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?","Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis."
The water level rose.,"Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice",Can you please get back to the drunk girl? Id like something to think about in the shower.
"Of course it did. Its said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.",No.,The water level rose.
"Forgive me, but I think youll find my story is more interesting.","Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.","Of course it did. Its said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
"Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.",Does yours have wet bweasts in it?,"Forgive me, but I think youll find my story is more interesting."
"When he finished, he shouted Eureka!","So, long story short, I nailed her.","Better. It has a gold crown.

"All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Whos ready to play some vintage video games? And tonights selections include ColecoVisions Smurf Rescue in Gargamels Castle, Ataris Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. Im fun.","No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Dont know why. Just do.","When he finished, he shouted Eureka!"
Im unhappy.,Check.,And Ill take a shower. Well meet back here in fifteen.
No.,Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?,Thats kind of creepy.

I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.,Thank you.
Thank you.,"Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.",I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
Are there beans in it?,Would you like some homemade chili?,Thank you.
"Then its not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but youre from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.",Yes.,Are there beans in it?
"Yes, please. Your girlfriends a little short-tempered.","Sheldon, do you want some or not?","Then its not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but youre from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
"Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?",Cheers.,"Id like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky."
Shes also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.,"Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.","Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
"Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, youre just an engineer, but that doesnt mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone elses Nobel prize acceptance speech.","Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick Ive been working on?",Th-th-th-thats okay. I can infer from context.
Is it any wonder he doesnt have a doctorate?,"Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.",Okay.
Its not cool. Its a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. Howd you do it?,"Yes, it is. Very cool!",Is that your card?
Fine. Give me a second.,A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.,Its not cool. Its a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. Howd you do it?
Its not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.,Seven of clubs! That is amazing!,"Thats your card, right?"
"Well, I dont care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.","Oh, really? So how did I do it?",Its not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
"I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.",I thought you had more important things to think about.,"Well, I dont care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked."
Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?,"Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.","I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards."
This deck is rigged in some fashion.,Oopsy.,"Yeah, I was talking to Raj."
So youre saying this is a regulation deck?,Fine. Get another deck and Ill do the trick with that.,This deck is rigged in some fashion.
Um,"Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?",And was your card the jack of diamonds?
"Oh, oh, please, if I dont know, you dont know. Thats axiomatic.","Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.","You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencils rubber!"
Leonard?,"Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just natures way?",I hope you werent cruel to her.
"I think I figured out Wolowitzs magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.",What?,Leonard?
As you wish.  Did you pick one?,"I am not opening that door, Sheldon.","I think I figured out Wolowitzs magic trick, and I need you to pick a card."

"As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheatons character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.","Oh! Oh, God!",How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
"Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.","I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.",Little bit.

I dont care.,Yes.,Brent Spiner?
"I did, but I think Ive kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.","Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.",I dont care.
"Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.","Im going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.","I did, but I think Ive kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey."

"Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.","Oh, wow. I havent seen one of these in years.  Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?","Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!"

"Frankly, Mom, Im encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.","Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lords forgiveness.",Whats Gunning with God? Im afraid to ask.

"And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you cantmake your mother fry it.","Oh, thats a funny turn, isnt it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you cant force things. You need to figure out if youre in a relationship or if youre just calling it one.

Also, her parents arent happy shes dating someone white."

"Im not going to get my pecan pie, am I?","I didnt get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.","And what do we do it with?  Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you cant find someone, but theres a lock for every key. Back home, theres a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.","Oh, they dont always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups.

"Ive got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. Im taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, Ive worked up a couple of Qs that will stump his sorry A.","Nope. She says if I dont back out shes going to go on a hunger strike.

"No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.","Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isnt making you a priority?","No, Im just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
"Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.",Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.,"No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."

It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."

Sure youre not coming down with a cold?",Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
"Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation.

"Technically, Howards the gear head. Leonards just a dime store laser jockey.","Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.","Jimmy, Im kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
"The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you cant live in fear of this man forever.","Aw, come on, you can figure it out. Youre like the smartest guy Ive ever known.",I dont think something like thats even possible.
"You clearly dont. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is youre a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.","Sheldon, I got this.","The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you cant live in fear of this man forever."
"Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, youre a mess.",Sheldon.,"You clearly dont. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is youre a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
A little bit? The man Super Glued Hersheys Kisses to your nipples.,I think what hes trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.,I dont understand.
This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.,What is that?,Thats funny because those arent the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
You really need to work on your penmanship.,Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.,Whats this word?
"Youre being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.",It wasnt fun for me.,"Oh, man, I, I dont know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun."
I help the weak. Its yet another way Im exactly like Batman.,"That was pretty badass, dude.","Come on, guys."
"Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?",Heres your cocoa.,And helping people.
Heated to precisely 183 degrees?,Yes.,"Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?",Yes.,Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.,You got one for good luck.  Ill get it.,"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
Yes.,No.,I wouldnt be imposing?
Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.,"Sheldon, we cant let him drive.",Yes.
Youd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.,"Not really, no. Its funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now were reversed. Youre the winner.",You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
You know what would be nice?,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.,"How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
"As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies whove tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once hes asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didnt say we should do it.",Whats that?,You know what would be nice?
Leonard.,"I dont think Mother Teresa Oh, that is adorable.","Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
"In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.",Yeah.,Leonard.
Youre soft. This worlds going to chew you up and spit you out.,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.,"In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
"Oh, there it is, tacos.","Morning, Jimmy.",When did I have tacos?
"Im not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.","Its good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.",Thats my French toast.
"The Dark Knight has your back. Hes scared, but he has your back.",I might kill him right now.,"Im not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
"Well said, Boy Wonder.","No, youre done. I want you out of my apartment right now.","Yeah, all right, let me just finish this."
Dont answer that. Its a trick question. I speak from experience.,Or what?,"Well said, Boy Wonder."
"You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.","Im not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh.",Dont answer that. Its a trick question. I speak from experience.
"I dont need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.","Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?","You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully."
"Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.","Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.","Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If youd like to examine it?"
This is how youre going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?,"Im telling you, dude, theres a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.","As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila."
A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. Youve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.,How is this lying?,This is how youre going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
"If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.","Cant you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?",A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. Youve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
"Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.",Dont be so hard on him. Its natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!,"Sheldon, hes just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really dont think theyre gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie."
Its still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.,How is that not amusing?,"Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose."
"And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?","Ooh, look whos out on a date. Pasadenas favourite power couple, Shamy.","Next time, you should open with that."
"All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?",That is so hot.,"Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night."
"Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.",How was your day?,"All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?"
"Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.",Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.,"Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits.

"Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, Im not gonna lie, feels pretty good.","Thats nice. Anyway, Ive been dreaming of this day for a long time.","Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers."

"Well, thats odd. We both washed up when we came in. Its probably a euphemism for urination.",Give me a minute. Im gonna go wash up.,"So, are we ready to order?"
"Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I dont know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.","Sheldon, what is wrong with you?","Well, thats odd. We both washed up when we came in. Its probably a euphemism for urination."
"Oh, I see why youre confused. No, her news sounded important, but what youre forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. Thats all about yucky, squishy things.","Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.","Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I dont know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside."
What if they simply dont excite me?,"Honey, shes upset. Youre her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things shes excited by.","Oh, I see why youre confused. No, her news sounded important, but what youre forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. Thats all about yucky, squishy things."
"Shed see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, its this.","Well, just smile and think about koalas.",What if they simply dont excite me?
Yes.,"Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?","Oh-ho-ho! I havent seen this trick in years. Its called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but theres a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live Dont look in there."
Had a rough night. I thought Id go for a walk and clear my head.,How come youre not doing a mission? Youre just wandering around.,Yes.
"Its after nine oclock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.",Some people go outside and do that.,Had a rough night. I thought Id go for a walk and clear my head.
No. I think Ill just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.,You want to talk about it?,"Its after nine oclock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
"Hard as this may be to believe, its possible that Im not boyfriend material.",You know digital alcohol is never a solution. Whats going on?,No. I think Ill just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.

Ill say.,"No, I cant. Im playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, Im no expert in women.",Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. Im gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
Im sorry. Its the alcohol talking. Go on.,Thats not necessary when someones trying to help you.,Ill say.

"Ooh, a pocket watch.","Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.",I dont think theres anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
"No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.","Okay, I dont think Amy wants a pocket watch.","Ooh, a pocket watch."
"Well, shes very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?","Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?","No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."

"Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon.

Not this time. Then they wouldnt be special. Thanks Penny.,"Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?",Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
"Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.",Awesome!,"Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!"
Oh dear Lord. No!,Ah!,"Oh, thats great. Lets open it up and put him in there."
Theyre mint in box.,"Why, theyre just toys?",Oh dear Lord. No!
Is someone there?,Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?,Please have a seat.  Im thinking double wedding!
Spock?,"Down here, on your desk.",Is someone there?
Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.,I need to speak with you.,Spock?
Was I hit on the head by a coconut.,"It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.",Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
But its mint in box.,"Im not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.",Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
"Well, Im not going to dignify that with a response.","Yes, and to open it would destroy its value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.",But its mint in box.
To be played with.,Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?,"Well, Im not going to dignify that with a response."
"Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, youre right. Ill do it.",Therefore? To not play with it would be?,To be played with.
"Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?  Its only logical.","Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.","Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, youre right. Ill do it."
Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.,"Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You dont want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.",Thats disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.
"What is it now, tiny Spock?","Hello again, Sheldon.",Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
Youre the one who told me to play with it.,I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonards. You should be ashamed of yourself.,"What is it now, tiny Spock?"
"No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.","If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?",Youre the one who told me to play with it.
"Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and hes never going to open it, so he wont know its broken. And I have a toy that isnt broken. Everybodys happy.","Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.","No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave."
I thought where you come from they dont have emotions.,Well I am unhappy.,"Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and hes never going to open it, so he wont know its broken. And I have a toy that isnt broken. Everybodys happy."
"You know what you are? Well, youre a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps its time you beam on out of here.",I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.,I thought where you come from they dont have emotions.
"Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.","Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.","You know what you are? Well, youre a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps its time you beam on out of here."
"Oh, I dont want a broken toy.  Nothing!",Do you hear how homophobic you sound?,"Yes, to other gay people."
Nothing. I said nothing.,What?,"Oh, I dont want a broken toy.  Nothing!"
"Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.",I dunno. I just think its a waste.  Relax. Im just looking at the box.,"Well I told you, you dont, its mint in box."
"My problem is that I dont want you to break Leonards toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.",What is your problem?,"Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands."
Mmmmm!,Yes.,"You know, youre right. I mean, its from you, Im never going to sell it. Im opening it."
"Oh, nice job, man-hands.",What?,Its broken.
"Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, lets all be mad at Stuart.","I didnt break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.","Oh, nice job, man-hands."
"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didnt tell you.",Absolutely.,"You know, I paid a lot for this. Lets take it over there and show him."
I didnt. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.,Why would you open mine?,"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didnt tell you."
I cant because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And thats a lie.,"Well, you should talk to Stuart.",I didnt. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.,What is the truth?,I cant because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And thats a lie.
"Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. Thats a lie.",Mmm.,"Okay, that I believe."
Yes.,"So, is that one mine.","Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. Thats a lie."
"Okay. Leonard, even though I dont have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.","Well, hand it over so I can open it.",Yes.
Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.,"And thats a lie, right?","Okay. Leonard, even though I dont have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it."
"Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanitys understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, its two a.m., get out of my bedroom?","Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. Itll look so nice next to the ones hes already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.","Hm, its no big deal."
"Well, I believe Ive done it. And Im only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.",Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?,"Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanitys understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, its two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
"Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isnt going to make any sense to you.","Thats incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.",Really?
"Yeah, good for you, and dont stop working on it.","Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.","Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isnt going to make any sense to you."
"Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.",Not on your life.,Still going to introduce him?
But I said Im sorry.,"I told you, no.","Please, please, please let me meet Hawking."
And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?,"No, you said, would it help if I said Im sorry?",But I said Im sorry.
"Um, to go to Jewish heaven?","Sheldon, youre a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?",And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
Then to avoid Jewish hell?,Jews dont have heaven.,"Um, to go to Jewish heaven?"
"Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.",Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.,Then to avoid Jewish hell?
Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine youre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out theres another human being.,"Oh, you cant be serious.","Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal."
"Yeah, okay, I can see youre going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine youre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.",Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?,Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine youre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out theres another human being.
"Oh, now theyre so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?",Get out of my lab.,"Yeah, okay, I can see youre going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine youre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
How about dolphins?,Get out.,"Oh, now theyre so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
Oh!,It was great. We talked about movies.,"So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?"
Oh!,I showed him some card tricks.,Oh!
Oh!,He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.,Oh!
"Howard, please, Im begging you.","Something got you down there, bunky?",Oh!
"Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.","Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesnt believe in to end his life quickly.","Raj, youre our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?"
"No, sir, no, I took my dads desk chair, attached a Speak  Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.",Youre kidding.,"Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween."
Its actually 01100111.,"You dont seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.","No, sir, no, I took my dads desk chair, attached a Speak  Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy."
"Im not asking for me, Im asking for Hawking.",No!,Its actually 01100111.
"Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough Ive made, hell reach out to me.","Let me try gansta, hells no.","Im not asking for me, Im asking for Hawking."
"He will, hes really smart.",What if he doesnt?,"Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough Ive made, hell reach out to me."
How do I do that?,Thats an interesting idea. Why dont you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?,"He will, hes really smart."
Walking away.,You walk away.,How do I do that?
"Hey, fellas, Im thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.","Well, dont be too mean.","Yeah, I know, Im just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him."
I wasnt talking to you.,I wouldnt mind a glass.,"Hey, fellas, Im thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
"Yes, yes. What did you decide?","Sheldon, come on back.",Bring him to his bony knees.
"Great, thank you. Oh, thats terrific.",Ill give your paper to Professor Hawking.,"Yes, yes. What did you decide?"
What kinds of things?,"But in exchange, Id like you to do a few things for me.","Great, thank you. Oh, thats terrific."
Of course.,Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?,What kinds of things?
All right. What would you like me to do first?,You should be so lucky.,Of course.
"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maws silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.","Well, I thought Id start you off by polishing my belt buckles.",All right. What would you like me to do first?
Thats a lot of belt buckles.,Thats nice.,"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maws silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maws forks never had that.,"Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, Ill let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what youre seeing there is splash back.",Thats a lot of belt buckles.
"Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.","Sheldon, these look great. Theyre like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. Howd you get them so shiny?","Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?,Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.,"Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
And you want me to return it for you?,"Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.",My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
What are you all staring at? Didnt you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?,"No, no, no, mon petit cherie.",And you want me to return it for you?
Hello.,Hey.,What are you all staring at? Didnt you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
This is not my laundry.,Its not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?,Hello.
Those are Howards.,"Wow, are these Amys? Kind of trashy, good for her.",This is not my laundry.
"Because if I dont, he wont give my paper to Stephen Hawking. Hes a famous physicist.",Ugh. Why are you washing Howards man panties?,Those are Howards.
Thats close enough.,"Yeah, yeah, I know, hes the wheelchair dude who invented time.","Because if I dont, he wont give my paper to Stephen Hawking. Hes a famous physicist."
"Because hes punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You dont think Im condescending, do you?","I dont understand, why doesnt Howard just introduce you to the guy?",Thats close enough.
"Oh, Im sorry, condescending means",Well,"Because hes punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You dont think Im condescending, do you?"
"Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.","I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.","Oh, Im sorry, condescending means"
Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.,"Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.","Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone."
"Well, I cant help it. Thats an involuntary twinkle.","See, there it is, theres that twinkle.",Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.,"What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?","Well, I cant help it. Thats an involuntary twinkle."
I knew it.,"Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.",I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
"What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?",Sheldon! I need your help!,"Oh, damn. Im sorry, I cant make it, but Sheldons going to go with you! And thats the last thing you do to him."
What do you want me to do?,"Its this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. Its like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!","What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?"
Im not sure how to do this.,"Were gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.",What do you want me to do?
"Sleeping bags dont usually sweat this much, but okay.","Its easy, just pretend youre putting away a sleeping bag.",Im not sure how to do this.
"Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.",Now zip me up.,"Sleeping bags dont usually sweat this much, but okay."
"Oh, no, you know, Im not really the holding kind of Oh!","Youre right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?","Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
"I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.","Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.","Wow, thats amazing."
Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?,I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.,"I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
"Oh, for heavens sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.",I dont know.,Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
Okay.,"All right, Sheldon, theres only one thing left I want you to do. Dont worry, its an easy one.","Oh, for heavens sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
Fine. You have very tiny hands.,Give me a compliment.,Okay.
Youre obviously good at what you do.,"No, about my job. I want you to tell me Im good at what I do.",Fine. You have very tiny hands.
"Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. Its just that what you do is not worth doing.","Well, then why are you always ripping on me?",Youre obviously good at what you do.
Now will you give my paper to Hawking?,"Thank you, Sheldon.",Its nicer than anything hes ever said to me. Id take it and run.
"What, why not?","Sorry, I cant.",Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
"All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that Im available at his earliest convenience.",I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.,"What, why not?"
"Professor Hawking, its an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.",Give it a second.,I thought he might be a little more excited.
I want to thank you for taking time to see me.,I know.,"Professor Hawking, its an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
I know.,My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.,I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
"Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.",Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.,I know.
What do you mean wrong?,Thats nice. Too bad its wrong.,"Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
"No, no, th-th-th-that cant be right. I-I dont make arithmetic mistakes.",You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.,What do you mean wrong?
"Oh, no, no, no, of course not. Its just, I was thinking Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.",Are you saying I do?,"No, no, th-th-th-that cant be right. I-I dont make arithmetic mistakes."
"I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine, Ill tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.","Oh, no, no, no, of course not. Its just, I was thinking Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.",Are you saying I do?
Wrong. Leonard?,"Okay, uh, Id pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck Ive always dreamed of having.","I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine, Ill tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it."
"Wrong, and lets keep it clean, shall we?","Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.",Wrong. Leonard?
"Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, youd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.","Also instead of just living in your mothers house, you could actually live inside her body.","Kangaroo, uh, Id be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball."
"All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, Ill just snack on this sunlight.",Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.,"Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, youd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad."
"Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, youre half swan.","Anyway, if its okay with you, we should talk about Howards bachelor party.","No, he didnt."
You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.,"Good for you, Howard. Im proud of you. And still, youre the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.","What can I tell ya, Im not into that stuff any more."
"Boo, wine! But yay, trains. Im in.",Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. Theyve got that wine train.,"Well, its probably not for me."
Its not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.,"Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.","You know, theres nothing wrong helping some womans kid get through their S.A.T.s."
"Indeed. If Im to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! Thats yucky.",Are you drinking whisky?,Its not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
"Im confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.","Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takeis house.","Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard."
Oh. I guess youre just friends with anybody.  Aagh!,"Oh, Im friends with Howard too.","Im confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group."
"And, apparently, Wil Wheatons best friend.",Hear! Hear!,"May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz."
Talk to the hand.,Sheldon,"And, apparently, Wil Wheatons best friend."
"Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howards expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought youd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Lets see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, youre actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And thats a zinger, because youre not. Ive always thought that youd make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming youd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I dont see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I dont!",Does anyone have any words theyd like to say about our man of the evening?,Talk to the hand.
Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howards expense.

And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!,She was my second cousin.,"Im not done, but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him Im addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
"Jeepers, Im drunk.","Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.","Oh, oh, dont get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us."
Here.,"Actually, you did do one of them together.","Its not your fault, its mine. I did all that stuff, not you."
Youre upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.,What is this?,Here.
"Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and its been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.","No, but what is it?",Youre upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
I just threw up the bachelor party.,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.,Im not calling the girl from Comic-con.
Im going to need a larger shirt. This ones a little tight under the arms.,"Thats great, uh, but thats not why I called. Weve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, missions been scrubbed.","Yes, yes, Ive been doing my push-ups. Im still stuck at nine, but thats going all the way down with no one holding me."
"Yes, of course thats why its tight.",Do you think maybe its tight because youre wearing long underwear?,Okay.
Youre kidding. Shouldnt the question be why arent you?,"All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?","Yes, of course thats why its tight."
"Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I dont like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?","No, it should be: why are you?",Youre kidding. Shouldnt the question be why arent you?
Said the hangman offering a noose.,Why dont you slip this on?,"Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I dont like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?"
"Ah, much better.","Make all the jokes you want, but theres only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.","Oh, please. I dont remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
"A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatevers in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, dont I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!",You must be burning up.,"Ah, much better."
Keys! Keys! Keys!,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.,"Uh, wheres he going?"
Amy?,What about  Cookies!,"Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
Its not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.,"Seven oclock, right on time.",Amy?
"I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, thats a hot date.","Well, dinners almost ready.",Its not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?,"Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.","I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, thats a hot date."

How much faster can this thing go?","With our friends moving forward in their relationships, Ive decided that we should make progress in ours as well.",What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
"Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.","I had a feeling youd be reluctant, which is why Im going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.","Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didnt even know each other, and now Im in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?"
"And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope youre not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because theres only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and thats called school.",I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.,"Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away."
"Well, seems whats on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.","Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera.

"If Ive learned anything from British television shows on PBS, its that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.",Given her what?,"Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think its appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?"
"Its a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, youre cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world thats just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.",What?,"If Ive learned anything from British television shows on PBS, its that servants dine downstairs with their own kind."

"No, thats not fair either.","All right, lets keep it simple. How about darts?","That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown."
Darts is a bar game. Youve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.,Why not?,"No, thats not fair either."
"Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, theyre all out.","Yeah, thats when it started.",Darts is a bar game. Youve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.

"Interesting hypothesis. Lets apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.",Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?,"But you know what wasnt a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, its your last night on Earth. Youd think youd get one porn channel."
"Its fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, Ive always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?","Anywhere but the Space Station.

Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuarts party and all eyes turn to see Americas most beloved and glamorous couple.",Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.,I couldnt agree more.
R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.,Yeah?,"Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuarts party and all eyes turn to see Americas most beloved and glamorous couple."

What are you smiling at?,"Hello, boys.","That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, wheres your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"
"A Tardis makes no sense. Its a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you dont get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.","So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummys tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.",There we go.
Yes! This party just became a major rager.,I dont care. Get the Tardis.,Do you have a preference?
Yes.,"Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?","Oh, Howard, Ive got a party to plan. Dont make me pull it out of you."

I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.,"Hey, look whos out after dark, like a big boy.",Are you kidding? Its a perfectly good chicken leg.
"Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.",I thought you had plans with Amy.,I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

Walked right out the door.,Then Amy got mad and left?,"Yes, quite the kerfuffle."
Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.,And you?,Walked right out the door.
Whys that?,"Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.",Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.

"Fine. Its a shame you didnt go to dinner with us, because the buffet youre about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.","Trust me, call her.",Youre just repeating what I said. Its like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
"Youll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that youre mad at me. Tell him youre not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.",What?,"Fine. Its a shame you didnt go to dinner with us, because the buffet youre about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close."

"Precisely, I didnt do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?","Im not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didnt do anything.","Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think theyre angry, theyre really just hungry."
"Wow, Amys mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.","Sheldon, Im your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. Thats it. End of story. Good night.","Keep going, buddy, youre doing great."

Itll warm her twaddle.","The trouble isnt with me, Penny, its with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle."

There have been many studies proving its validity.,"Im sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?"
"How can you sleep? Im not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.","Sheldon, this isnt helping. Why dont you just let me get some rest.","Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
Yes. All over it.,"You, you want to rub something on my chest?","How can you sleep? Im not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest."
"Now youre being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.",Maybe we should start with that.,Yes. All over it.
"And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.","Thats great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.",You can do it.
"No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.",That was great. Rub my chest again.,"And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end."
"Oh, Im hanging in there. Thanks for asking.",Hows the poor thing?,"No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up."
"Uh, Im going to draw you a soothing bath. Wheres your bath thermometer?","Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but theres a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.","Oh, Im hanging in there. Thanks for asking."
Fine. Then Im going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.,I dont have a bath thermometer.,"Uh, Im going to draw you a soothing bath. Wheres your bath thermometer?"
"Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?",All right. Ill tell him.,"I dont mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
"Im surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you werent recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.","Oh, Sheldon, am I glad youre back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think Im going to need another bath.","Oh, look, its a female. You can see all the eggs."
"I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.",Oh?,"Im surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you werent recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab."
"It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.","All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. Its just been so nice having you take care of me.","I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire."
"It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.",I feel terrible I did this.,"It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour."
"In a perfect world, Id lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.",I suppose thats fair. What do you suggest?,"It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
"Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didnt kill a man. You know, its a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.",I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.,"In a perfect world, Id lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit."
I dont want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.,Are you saying you want to spank me?,"Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didnt kill a man. You know, its a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey."
Are you prepared to receive your punishment?,I wouldnt go that far.,Great couple of gals.
Why?,One second. I want to put on some music.,Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
"Very well, then. Get over my knee. Lets begin.",I dont want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.,Why?
Excuse me. Youre not supposed to be enjoying this.,"Oh, my.","Very well, then. Get over my knee. Lets begin."
Maybe I will.,Then maybe you should spank me harder.,Excuse me. Youre not supposed to be enjoying this.
"Yeah, oh, Im sorry. I shouldve mentioned this earlier. Youre not invited.","Oh, great! Ive always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.","Little bit, yeah."
"Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.",Why not?,"Yeah, oh, Im sorry. I shouldve mentioned this earlier. Youre not invited."
"Yeah, like a bunch of savages.",By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?,"Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves."
A Christmas gift? You know I dont enjoy Christmas.,"All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.",Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!
"Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words tis and twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?",Whats wrong with Christmas?,A Christmas gift? You know I dont enjoy Christmas.
"Actually that helps, thank you.",Pirate with a peg leg?,"Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words tis and twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?"
"Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. Theyre my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, thats a saucy twist. That leaders name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.",Would you just look inside?,"Actually that helps, thank you."
"Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.","Its actually ho, ho, ho, but youll get the hang of it. Thought itd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.","Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. Theyre my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting.

I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.,"Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?",Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
Lucky.,"But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?","Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, youre out of the game."
"I know theyre making a rhetorical point, I just dont know what it is.","Hey, guys. I dont mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought youd like to see what youre missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadettes wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And theres Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit Im assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.","Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud."
I open the chest.,"I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go blublublublublublublublu",Great. What do you do?
"Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.","Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.",Walls are getting closer.
"Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.","Seven, six.",What are we supposed to do?
"Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even",Somebody sing the damn song.,"Three, two."
"Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.",The walls are getting slower.,"Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even"
"It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.",How did you know that?,"That was amazing, Sheldon."
"W-W-Wait. Theres still four more verses. You dont sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou knowst it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling?

"Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.","Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesnt, I mean, at all. What?",Think harder.
I think the word youre looking for is bravo.,Done?,"Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum."
Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?,"Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.",I think the word youre looking for is bravo.
"Well its a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.",I dont know. Whats the difference?,Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?,Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.,"Well its a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture."
"Oh, its like Im really there.","You see those, too.",What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
"Yes. What, is there a problem?",What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?,Good story.
Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year round. Ive been known to enjoy this poolside.,"No, its nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.","Yes. What, is there a problem?"
"Oh, dont be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?","Come on, Sheldon.

No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.,"I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell hed been there because the paper would be graded.",What was so bad about them?
"Yeah, Im familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.",It wasnt amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.,No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.,"Now that I know she doesnt like me, Im kind of into her.",What?
Play through the pain.,My carpal tunnels acting up.,The drawbridge is lowering.
"But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.",I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.,"Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Dont ever tell my mother I said that."
"You cant talk, youre paralyzed. I get right up in Santas big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again.

"My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died.

I understand.,"Oh. Ive been wanting to talk to you. Im sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isnt one of them.","Well, then, you shouldnt have jingle bells on your boots."

You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.",What did I do?,Lets not call it a problem. Lets call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.

"Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I dont hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, youre a slave to your desire to reproduce.

Hello.,Come in.,Human Resources Department.
Thank you.,"Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.",Hello.
"So Ive been told. But I cant understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. Theres string cheese in my mini-fridge, and thats for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.",I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.,Thank you.
Like what?,"Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.","So Ive been told.

"Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. Youre a slave.","Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I dont even know what that means, but Im gonna go ahead and tell you you cant say it.",Like what?

"I dont see why Im the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.","Whuh-ah! Woah! You cant talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and Im gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.","Well, y-you, I-Im just saying, you know, at a certain point in a womans menstrual cycle"
"Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasnt racist. Hes also brown.",Hofstadter Wolowitz and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?,"I dont see why Im the one being persecuted here.

"Well, hello.","Im sorry, Im a feminist, I dont notice things like how many breasts a robot has.",Did it have six breasts?

I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized Im deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms."
"It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.","And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if youre menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I dont have to.","Thats it. All of you, in my office now!"
"Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesnt happen in the future.","Thank you, Dr. Cooper.","It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology."
"Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, Im gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, youd better ace it, theyre pretty mad.",Okay.,"Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesnt happen in the future."
"Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we dont need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chickens come home to roost.","Hey, will you steam my uniform next?",Where are we going?
"Thats a wise policy. I once borrowed my sisters makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.","Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesnt share with his girlfriend.","Damn, youve got more makeup than I do. Youve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, Im borrowing this."
"So to answer your question, no, its not better.","Well, its a lot smaller. Its more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.",Is that better?

Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery.

"Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.","Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.","Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, Id rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committees going to be there."
"Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.","Of course it would. Im well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.","Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful."
Okay.,Lets go over our emotional responses one last time.,"Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. Ive got to get tenure. Okay, lets meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like were both going to be living like animals."
Sad.,"Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?",Okay.
Glad.,The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesnt make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?,Sad.
Bad. However,Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?,Glad.
Fine. Bad.,No.,Bad. However
Youre here.,Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.,Fine. Bad.
So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.,"Excuse me. Im here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.",Youre here.
What are you going to do? Take peoples drink orders and get them wrong?,"Im here to support my man, just like you.",Id like to know why Pennys here.
What? Did she do it yet?,Do it.,What are you going to do? Take peoples drink orders and get them wrong?
"Well, thats a fine how-do-you-do. Dont just stand there. Take your breasts out.",She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonards cause.,What? Did she do it yet?
Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?,"You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.",Way to hit em with both barrels.
"Okay, because that was not clear.",Yes.,Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
What? That was ambiguous.,Sheldon!,"Okay, because that was not clear."
Um,"Well, now its biguous. What are you gonna do about it?",What? That was ambiguous.
"Well, yes, of course, he wouldnt like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.",You could talk some smack about his mother.,Um
"I dont know what youre doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Rajs mother for a dollar.","Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?","Well, yes, of course, he wouldnt like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother."
What do you think I should do?,"How about it, Sheldon?",Youre right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
"I dont want any more, but lets go.","Well, youll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether youll make any more friends.",What do you think I should do?
"Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, Im going in is what I said to your mother last night. Dont worry, I didnt really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.","Yeah, screw it. Im going in.",No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
Mrs Davis? I know youre in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.,Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.,"Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, Im going in is what I said to your mother last night. Dont worry, I didnt really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting."
"I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.",What?,Mrs Davis? I know youre in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.
"I dont know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.","Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.","I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure."
"No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.","You didnt bring another gift, did you?","I dont know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude."
"Anyway, thank you.",Good.,"No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate."
"Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?",Youre welcome.  Im gonna pretend that didnt happen.,"Anyway, thank you."
Answer honestly. This is not a trial. Thatll come later.,No.,"Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?"
Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?,"Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.","Absolutely not. Help me out here, I cant afford another demerit."
Im deleting it.,I dont know. Its a fat guy on a Segway. Thats funny everywhere.,Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?
"No, thats the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. Im going to re-watch it before season three starts.","You know, if youre trying to make space on the DVR, why dont you just get rid of some of the stuff youve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.","Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese havent finished watching it yet."
"Well, they cant cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.",There is no season three. They cancelled that show.,"No, thats the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. Im going to re-watch it before season three starts."
Dumplings? Dont you understand whats going on here?,"Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?",They did.
"That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now Ill never know what happened.","As a rule, no.",Dumplings? Dont you understand whats going on here?
"Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, Ill make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, Ill rub pudding on my gums. Im going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.","Well, why dont you make up your own ending?","That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now Ill never know what happened."
No. They cant just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.,"Oh, please, dont do that.","Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, Ill make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, Ill rub pudding on my gums. Im going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for."
"Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them its me, and I dont want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about yall cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?",I thought you grew up on a farm.,Its six thirty in the morning.
I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.,"Im sorry youre upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.","Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them its me, and I dont want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about yall cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?"
"Oh, thats nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I dont care how they end.","Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.",I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
"Yeah, but I just told you, I dont have a problem with closure.","You know, I might be able to help you with this. Theres a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.","Oh, thats nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I dont care how they end."
"Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing.",You sure about that?,"Yeah, but I just told you, I dont have a problem with closure."
I take issue with the word compulsive.,Ive come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.,"Oh. Well, thats like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs."
"tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, lets say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?","All Im saying is, we live in a world where closure isnt always an op",I take issue with the word compulsive.
By playing tic-tac-toe?,Im going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isnt so overwhelming.,"tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, lets say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?"
"Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since Im about to win.  B-But we didnt finish.",Yep. Your turn.,By playing tic-tac-toe?
The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.,Exactly. How does that make you feel?,"Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since Im about to win.  B-But we didnt finish."
"Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.",And thats exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.,The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
You dont know what its like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.,"Come on, you can do this.","Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off."
Yes.,"Thats quite an impressive layout, isnt it?","Oer the land of the free, and the home of the Next."
Lets box it up.,Lets box it up.,Yes.
"Lucky for you, cause I wished you were dead.","Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish cant come true.","Thats enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!"
"Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.","Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.","So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?"
"Well, youre an excellent neuroscientist, youre a wonderful girlfriend, and",Im a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.,"Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
"Doesnt matter, does it?",And?,"Well, youre an excellent neuroscientist, youre a wonderful girlfriend, and"
And a complete sucker.,"Im proud of you, Sheldon.","Doesnt matter, does it?"
"Oh, yeah.",And a complete sucker.,"Im proud of you, Sheldon."
There he is.,"Oh, yeah.",And a complete sucker.
And the home of the brave.,There he is.,"Oh, yeah."
"Dont stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.",And the home of the brave.,There he is.
"I love you, too.","Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that youre in my life.","Dont stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that."
"Leonard, youll never guess who I just found online. Hey!",Got it.,"The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When youre happy with those, you press this button."
"Very mature. Youre lucky Im out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, youll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.","Eh, his giant head did most of the work.",Nice shot.
Yes.,Youre kidding. Hes still alive?,"Very mature. Youre lucky Im out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, youll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton."
Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.,"Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.",He was the host of this great Hey!
"Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. Hes still available for parties and events. We should hire him.","Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.",It was pretty cool.
"Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.",Hire him to do what?,"Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. Hes still available for parties and events. We should hire him."
"Well, Im e-mailing him right now.","It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didnt I?","Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar."
Of course I do.,Do you remember his old theme song?,"Well, Im e-mailing him right now."
"Its happening. Leonard, its happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.",Thank you.,"To be honest, shed do better in the kennel. Ill talk to Bernie. Im sure its fine."
And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you Id find a tactful way to do that.,You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?,Youre kidding.
"As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you cant solve if you use your noggin.",Howd you get him to come to your house?,And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you Id find a tactful way to do that.
"Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.",And he wrote him a cheque.,"As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you cant solve if you use your noggin."
"Leonard, are you in bed?","I feel for ya. Ive got a psychotic mommy, too.","Yes. Also, dont forget to close the toilet or shell drink out of it."
"Me, too.",Yes.,"Leonard, are you in bed?"
I cant sleep.,Great.,"Me, too."
"Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?","Well, I can, so shut up.",I cant sleep.
Im thinking of wearing a tuxedo.,"Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, youre gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.","Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?"
Do you have cufflinks?,Thats not ridiculous. Good night.,Im thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
"Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three oclock in the morning?",No.,Do you have cufflinks?
"Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof Ow! Leonard?","Okay, good night.","Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three oclock in the morning?"
I still cant sleep.,What?,"Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof Ow! Leonard?"
Im getting worried.,"Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.","Yes, you were!."
"Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four oclock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case wed join him in progress.  Its him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.","Relax, Sheldon, hes only a few minutes late.",Im getting worried.
The third floor landing. The poor old guys been walking up the stairs for half an hour. Its really you.,Where is he?,"Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four oclock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case wed join him in progress.  Its him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye."
"Professor Proton, its an honour to meet you.",I agree.,"Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We shouldve told you about the broken elevator."
"Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means were friends.","Just, just call me Arthur.","Professor Proton, its an honour to meet you."
Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying its going to ruin my eyes.,"No. A friend wouldve, wouldve told me about the elevator.","Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means were friends."
I am.,"Actually, hes a genius.","Is, uh, is he dangerous?"
"Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the shows for me. Come on. Ill race ya, Arthur.","Well, I hope I havent, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.",Hello.
"Yes. And if theres time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.","You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a childrens science show?","Thats too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding."
"Yeah, thats great. Did you bring your puppet?","You know, Im a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.","Yes. And if theres time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
"Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? Its nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!","No, no. I, I hate that puppet.","Yeah, thats great. Did you bring your puppet?"
Its gonna get sucked in. Its going to get sucked in.,I think I know.,"Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?"
Yes.,"Okay, I didnt know.",Its gonna get sucked in. Its going to get sucked in.
Potato clock. Do potato clock.,"I, I figured that out.","See, Im not a scientist like them."
"What, well whats wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.","No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think Im done.","Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldnt that solve the worlds energy crisis?"
"Well, how can you say that? Professor Protons the best.","I dont know. I think Im just, I, I just, I just dont want to be Professor Proton any more.",Then what is it?
"Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446","What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, Im, Im an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think Im a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.","Well, how can you say that? Professor Protons the best."
"I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?",What do you two talk about?,"But if you dont mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?"
"Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didnt have any friends growing up.","Ill, Ill give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.","I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?"
"But, um, I did have you. And every day at four oclock, youd come to my house on Channel 68, and wed do science together. If it hadnt been for you, well, who knows what wouldve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I couldve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.","No, I, I get that.","Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didnt have any friends growing up."
"Yeah, its true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.","I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.","But, um, I did have you. And every day at four oclock, youd come to my house on Channel 68, and wed do science together. If it hadnt been for you, well, who knows what wouldve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I couldve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon."
Ill do it.,You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?,"Your vitals are stable, but lets take you in for some tests just to be safe."
"Oh, yeah.","No, thats not a rule. He can go.","Hes not a relative, hes not allowed, right?"
"Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, thisll be the best day ever.","Well, at, at this point, Im just glad someones carrying me down the stairs.",Im sorry things turned out this way.
"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.,Sorrys not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what youve done.
Want me to sing it again?,"Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.","Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
"There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?","No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.",Want me to sing it again?
Name it.,"No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.","There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?"
"Oh, youre not. You look awful.","Well, Im, Im booked to do a childrens party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I dont feel up to it.",Name it.
Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?,"Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe youd fill in for me.","Oh, youre not. You look awful."
"Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.",Yeah.,Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
"But theyll know Im not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?",Or a Korean family in Alhambra.,"Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods."
"So, in a way its like Im your son.",Sounds great.,"But theyll know Im not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?"
Father.,"What, Whatever.","So, in a way its like Im your son."
Dungeons  Dragons.,Its gonna get crazy.,Anything can happen.
"Ive got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.","Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.","Im sorry, why old?"
"Yeah, yeah, well be right there. Leonard?",Ready whenever you guys are.,"Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her."
Im not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.,Yeah?,"Yeah, yeah, well be right there. Leonard?"
"Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. Im upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. Im upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. Im upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. Im saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.","Oh, thats nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.",Im not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
"As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.","See, Howards just as good a dungeon master as I am.","Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero."
"Go on, give him your lunch money.","Well be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappalis bloody corpse, and says,  Well, Im just a tree, but if I were you, Id listen to your ghost friend.","Youre right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. Im dead, Ive got a date with a girl. Bye."
"He does sound effects, too!","Uh, it does.",I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
"Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.","Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.","He does sound effects, too!"
"Ah, thats my girl.",You guys enjoy your evening. Im gonna go before I ruin anybody elses weekend.,"Oh, its not so bad. You lost money, youre filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, thats Vegas, you nailed it."
"It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play DD? Do you have a drug problem?","No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know its not the night you had in mind, but why dont you guys stay and play with us? Itll be fun.","Ah, thats my girl."
"Well, Ive just never played Dungeons  Dragons with girls before.","Whats the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.","It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play DD? Do you have a drug problem?"
Ill leave it up to the dungeon master.,"So, what do you say?","Oh, dont worry, sweetie. No one has."
"Yeah, we, now, Penny, we dont consume alcohol during Dungeons  Dragons. It impairs our judgment.","Okay, who wants a drink?","A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  Youre playing DD. Youre playing DD. This whole apartment is playing DD."
"Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.","Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!","Double potion, please."
I ready my quarter-staff.,I draw my broadsword.,What do you do?
"Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.","Fifteens the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me were playing for money.","Uh, fifteen or higher."
That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.,"Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.","Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres."
Yay!,"The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.",Im sweating out of my head.
"Yeah, uh, wait. Doesnt he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?","But wait., hes not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.",Yay!
The dragons Christopher Walken. Thats perfect.,"Fine.  Youd think, after all these years, Id know not to fly over volcanoes. Im a freaking idiot.","Yeah, uh, wait. Doesnt he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
Wait. Wait. And says?,Its a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.,Here we go. Fifteen?
"Oh, I dont know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.",Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.,Wait. Wait. And says?
Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.,"Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, Im gonna take you on a whole different adventure.","This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master."
"Oh, then Im out.","Sheldon, theyre talking about sex.",Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
You see what happens when you let girls play DD?,I dont like this.,"The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc hes ever seen, and hes overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, cause apparently shes into that. What do you do?"
Ive never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.,What?,You see what happens when you let girls play DD?
Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.,You dont have to come in here and cheer me up.,Ive never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
"Well, I dont think our relationship is a joke. I think a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?, thats a joke. Its a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.",Ill tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.,Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
"Oh, my. Thats an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.","Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?","Well, I dont think our relationship is a joke. I think a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?, thats a joke. Its a good one, too, because a horse has a long face."
And now what?,And now?,"Oh, my. Thats an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone."
I have not ruled it out.,Do you have any interest now?,And now what?
"I know it doesnt seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.",Wow. Talk dirty to me.,I have not ruled it out.
"More? I mean, look at us. Its only been three years, here we are in bed together.","I guess I know that. Its just, part of me wants more.","I know it doesnt seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate."
"Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldnt really be playing the game right if we didnt see that through.",Come on. Lets go back out there.,"More? I mean, look at us. Its only been three years, here we are in bed together."
"I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off.",Okay.,"Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldnt really be playing the game right if we didnt see that through."
What do you do?,Oh.,"I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off."
I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.,I kiss you on the lips.,What do you do?
I erotically caress your  nose.,I remove your armour. What do you do?,I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.
"Were fine, thank you.","Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?",Keep rolling.
"Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.","Id love that, but shes not really comfortable around people.","So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
"Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.",Hows that been working for you?,"Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek."
"Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.",I have a job.,"Leonard, I may have gotten you a job."
"Well, now, but do you think thats a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?","He knows, wow.","Yeah, Ive worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen."
"No one asked you, Uhura.","Hey, dont discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.","Well, now, but do you think thats a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?,"No one asked you, Uhura.","Hey, dont discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity."
Great. Ive been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?,What do you think?,Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
"Well, thats the thing about factoids, theyre interesting.",Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.,Great. Ive been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
"Im not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.",I know what youre doing. You dont want me going on this research trip because youre afraid to be alone.,"Well, thats the thing about factoids, theyre interesting."
"Fine, no more drowning talk. Ill change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?",Sheldon.,"Im not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning."
"Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesnt change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?","Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say thats going to stop me.","Fine, no more drowning talk. Ill change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
"Leonard, youre being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so well have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.","Theres beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really dont need to make a big deal.","Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? Its funnier with the accent."
"Oh, gee, I dont know. My schedules a little busy.","The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.",And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the hecks going on in there.
"Fine, Ill do it.","A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.",Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
"This is ridiculous, were shopping for a party and this store doesnt even have a party section.",We might as well go ahead and eat. Shes not coming back anytime soon.,I think I have to go to the bathroom.
"You know, I have to say, Penny, I dont understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.","Yeah, it does, and here we are.","This is ridiculous, were shopping for a party and this store doesnt even have a party section."
"Yeah, well, youre his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe youre not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each others arms and britches.","Well, Im his girlfriend, of course Im gonna support him.","You know, I have to say, Penny, I dont understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this."
"Its not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawkings theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? Im interested in the big questions.","Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.","Yeah, well, youre his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe youre not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each others arms and britches."
Im not jealous. Im just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.,"Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.","Its not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawkings theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? Im interested in the big questions."
It was you.,"Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesnt take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasnt very good at her job.",Im not jealous. Im just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.,"It wasnt me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair",It was you.
They lie so they dont look petty.,"I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, Im happy for you. Because thats what friends do.",You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
How?,Yeah.,They lie so they dont look petty.
Wow. No wonder you didnt get that toothpaste commercial.,Like this. I am so happy for you.,How?
"Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  Thats, uh, B-flat, for those who dont have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldnt be happier for him.","She is. Shes just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. Shell be here. Just give it a rest, okay?","Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming."
"Well, I mean it. Im really happy for you. And thats how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.","Thank you, Sheldon. That mustve been very hard for you to say.","Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  Thats, uh, B-flat, for those who dont have perfect pitch.

Thank you.,It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.,Cheers.
It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.,"Me, too.","Raj, Im so sorry."
"Penny, were in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. Were breaking the law.","Im gonna miss you, too.",Yep. Im really gonna miss you.
"All right, you have to get out of the car right now. Im not going to jail for you.","Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.","Okay, theres no space in the white zone, so"
"Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.",Would you just relax?,"All right, you have to get out of the car right now. Im not going to jail for you."
"Oh, dear Lord, a police officers glancing in our direction. Weve been made.",Okay.,Im covered.
"Its just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonards face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.","Oh, Leonard.",Calm down. Im getting out. I have something I want to give you.
"Dont worry, Officer. They just love each other. Were not smuggling drugs.","I love you, too.",I love you.
"Hello to you, too. Im sorry, but this is important.","Sheldon, its not a great time, what do you want?",Does he ever shut up?

"So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?",So?,"Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case."
"Youre dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?","Sheldon, I got to go inside. Its getting rough out here.","So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?"
"This isnt a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.",What was what?,"Youre dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?"
No!,"Okay, Im hanging up now. You know theres no such thing as a k","This isnt a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken."
Penny.,No!,"Okay, Im hanging up now. You know theres no such thing as a k"
"Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind youd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.",Whats the matter?,Penny.
"To be honest, I did.","Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?","Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind youd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed."

"No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you dont miss Leonard as much, uh, cause youre being kind of a baby about it.",Good night.,Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
Youre welcome. Good night.,You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.,"No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you dont miss Leonard as much, uh, cause youre being kind of a baby about it."
"Dear Lord, youre an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.","Well, you should be, cause she was looking good.",Im proud of you.
"Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.",Is that true?,"Dear Lord, youre an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way."
"I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.","Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amys out of town, would you like to join us?",Of course. Youre my friend. I want you to be happy.
"Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains","Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.","Aw, I love you, too. If I dont talk to you before you go to sleep, Ill meet you in dreamland."
"Well, now that Ive piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.",No.,"Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains"
You overestimate his significance in my life.,Why dont you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?,"Well, now that Ive piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess."
Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I dont think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?,Mmm.,You overestimate his significance in my life.
"Well, I try.","Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.",Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup?

"If I make this move, but I wont because were having too much fun.","So that means I lose, right? Its over?",My queen can now take your rook from below.
Were all out of alcohol.,"Okay, lets take a break.","If I make this move, but I wont because were having too much fun."
"Well, if youd like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As Ive explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain.

I miss him so much.",Were all out of alcohol.
"Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.",Im calling him.,"Well, if youd like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As Ive explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island."

That youre having to process your emotional pain without vodka?,I cant believe it. All this time Ive been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?,Your husbands weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
Allow me to comfort you. At least youve got your health.,No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.,That youre having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
"Um, uh, in a hundred years, youll both be dead and it wont matter?","Really? That, thats it? Thats comforting?",Allow me to comfort you. At least youve got your health.
"Oh, no, I dont think thats true at all.","No. Come on, youre supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason hes partying is to cover up his pain.","Um, uh, in a hundred years, youll both be dead and it wont matter?"
"Well, perhaps youre obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?",This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because hes off having a good time?,"Oh, no, I dont think thats true at all."
"Actually, I cant. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that Id take care of you.","Okay, that, thats great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.","Well, perhaps youre obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?"
Yes.,He did?,"Actually, I cant. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that Id take care of you."

"Oh, seriously?",Thanks.,"Well, if its any consolation, Im sure Leonards tormented every moment hes away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. Its in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.,"Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, Ill tell you about it.",Is that right?
"Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.",Come on. Its still early. Lets do something.,Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. Its in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.

Ive seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.,"Okay, look, heres something people do not know about me.

"Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo.

"Yes, I am.","Oh, and heres a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food.

"No, its you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.",Is it Penny?,I hear a womans voice.
"Theres kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.","Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.","No, its you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing."

"My point is, were a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.",Whats your point?,"I wasnt speaking about me. I mean, honestly, theres no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
"Well, I should hope so. I dont see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, thats the kind of thing that makes people think youre weird. Poor kid. She just doesnt see it.","I like you, too.","My point is, were a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all."
Cant talk. In the zone.,What are you working on?,Pull.
"Cant listen, zone. Also dont care.","Guys, listen up.","Oh, calm down. If I had it, Id be dead already."
Really dont care.,Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.,"Cant listen, zone. Also dont care."
When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?,Sheldon?,That is so beautiful.
"Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.","Well, for starters, youve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?","Yeah. Hey, how come youve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?"
Zone.,Sheldon?,Thats beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
"Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.","Sheldon, I know youre in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I cant believe Im gonna say this, but you havent spoken in hours and Im starting to get worried. Please say something.",Hell figure it out when he falls off the roof.
"Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And its beautiful. Its not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.","Nope, it was better before.","Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
"Did I? Well, that cant be right. No ones ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain","Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?","Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And its beautiful. Its not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
"Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I dont care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.",Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.,"Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
"Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.","Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.","Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon."
"Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although Im pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.","Sheldon, thats incredible.","Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
"Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but dont worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe Ive always been.","So, what happens next?","Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although Im pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line."
"Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.",Good to know.,"Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but dont worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe Ive always been."
"Lets see, whats next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.","Yeah, Im trying to be sad about that. I cant.","Well, youve probably never had to do this stuff cause youre young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
"And thats why youre not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess whos getting an article written about him in Physics Today? Ill give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.",I dont think the Smithsonians gonna want your marker.,"Lets see, whats next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery."
"Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.","Sheldon, Im so proud of you.","And thats why youre not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess whos getting an article written about him in Physics Today? Ill give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and,Whats next?,"Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
"No. No, no, no, no.",And what?,This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and
Ive made a horrible mistake.,Whats wrong?,"No. No, no, no, no."
"This table, its in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?",What are you talking about?,Ive made a horrible mistake.
"Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.",That Americans cant handle the metric system?,"This table, its in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?"
"Yeah, well, they shouldnt have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didnt know about.",But the Chinese team found the element.,"Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000."
Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.,So you just got lucky?,"Yeah, well, they shouldnt have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didnt know about."
"What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. Im not a genius, Im a fraud.","You and me both, brother. It doesnt matter. The element was found because of you, and thats groundbreaking.",Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
"Oh, great. Now Im worse than a fraud. Im practically a biologist.","You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, were forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.","What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. Im not a genius, Im a fraud."
Theres nothing happy about it. Im being given credit that I dont deserve.,": You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.","Oh, great. Now Im worse than a fraud. Im practically a biologist."
"No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. Ive got to find a way to stop this thing.","Oh, people get things they dont deserve all the time. Look at me with you.",Theres nothing happy about it. Im being given credit that I dont deserve.
"You know, frankly, Id prefer a sex tape.","Buddy, I dont think you can. I mean, once its out there, its out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.","No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. Ive got to find a way to stop this thing."
No.,"You dont know what a sex tape is, do you?","You know, frankly, Id prefer a sex tape."
Stop it. Stop celebrating me.,There he is.,"It will be. I dont call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, Im referring to you."
"And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. Youre fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasnt the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.",Woo!,Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
"Oh, no, they found the element.  No, no, stop it. I dont need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?","Wait, I dont understand. They didnt find the element?","And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. Youre fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasnt the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.,Im getting worried about Bernadette. Im gonna call and check on her.,"Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesnt count."
I know. When will this nightmare end?,"Oh, thats a big deal.",The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
Youre not?,Im not.,"Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. Were really proud of you."
Thats the most romantic thing Ive ever heard.,"Sheldon, Ive been thinking about it, and youre right. You dont deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, Im embarrassed for you.",Youre not?
"Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.","Damn it, everyones better at this than me.",Thats the most romantic thing Ive ever heard.
"I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.","Oh, no.",Poor Bernadette.
She might be contagious. Dont you think Im having a rough enough day?,"Sheldon, get over here.",Howie.
"Is it me, or does she not look so good?","If I didnt have you, life would be blue, Id be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.",Sheldon.
"Shes sick, I knew it. Bye.","Howie, that was amazing. Look, Im shaking.","Oh, we couldnt have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette."
I cant believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.,"Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didnt save them all.",Is that a pregnancy test?
You distract me. Ive been distracted since the moment I met you.,Me? What did I do?,I cant believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
"Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.",Sorry.,You distract me. Ive been distracted since the moment I met you.
Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?,"Oh, Sheldon.","Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do."
Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I cant wait until I get a rash.,Thats because youve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.,Ive never seen him this happy before.
"Hey, isnt that Professor Proton?","Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.",Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I cant wait until I get a rash.
"Look at him, just standing in line like he wasnt moderately famous 30 years ago. Lets go say hello.","Oh, yeah.","Hey, isnt that Professor Proton?"
"Im not going to bother him, Im going to talk to him.","Oh, maybe we shouldnt bother him.","Look at him, just standing in line like he wasnt moderately famous 30 years ago. Lets go say hello."
"Arthur? Arthur, its me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.",He thinks theres a difference.,"Im not going to bother him, Im going to talk to him."
"This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.","Trust me, I, I remember.","Arthur? Arthur, its me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age."
"So, what prescription are you getting filled?","No, shes not.","Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?"
"No. Wait, I want to guess. Dont tell me.",Sheldon.,"So, what prescription are you getting filled?"
"No, no, no. Im really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?","Sheldon, come on.",I wasnt going to tell you.
"But Im hanging out with my friend, and were having fun. Look how happy he is.","Hey, Sheldon, lets go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.","Well, given my age, thats more than just a lucky guess."
Goody. Whats it say?,"Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.",How is that possible?
"Thats strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonards email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I cant believe he picked you over me.","Hes working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if Id take a look at it.",Goody. Whats it say?
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.,"Yeah, its nothing to cry about.",You dont want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasnt done any real science in decades.
And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day hes just another Hollywood phony.,"Its true, youd rust.",Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
"Yeah, they say dont meet your heroes. Dont peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, youll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.",Is it really worth getting upset about?,And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day hes just another Hollywood phony.
Thats even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.,"Come on, hes a retired kids show host.","Yeah, they say dont meet your heroes. Dont peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, youll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
"Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.",Have you ever thought about why Arthur didnt want you to read his paper?,Thats even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
"Thats kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, Ive mastered the big three. Theres the coy smile. Theres the friendly chuckle. Theres the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last ones tricky, Im still working on it.","Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.","Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
What?,"From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you","Thats kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, Ive mastered the big three. Theres the coy smile. Theres the friendly chuckle. Theres the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last ones tricky, Im still working on it."
"No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. Ive heard it my whole life. The words annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say Im annoying.",Doesnt matter.,What?
"Oh, it wont hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say Im annoying. Im annoying. Im annoying. Im annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say Im annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she cant stand it when Im right.",Sheldon.,"No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. Ive heard it my whole life. The words annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say Im annoying."
Arthur. Door knocker. Thats TV money.,When did I have pistachios?,Be right back.
"Im sorry, did I wake you?","Sheldon, what are you doing here?",Arthur. Door knocker. Thats TV money.
"Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isnt on this map of Hollywood stars.","Of course you woke me, its seven thirty.","Im sorry, did I wake you?"
Its been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.,"What do you want, Sheldon?","Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isnt on this map of Hollywood stars."
"Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.",She sounds like a keeper.,Its been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
"No, no, now that weve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.","All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.","Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry."
"Well, then, Ill make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said its promising and hes going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that youre a washed-up has-been. Or dead.","Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.","No, no, now that weve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you."
"So, uh, what do you say?",I should be so lucky.,"Well, then, Ill make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said its promising and hes going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that youre a washed-up has-been. Or dead."
"Its because Im annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say Im annoying.","You know, if its all the same with you, I, I think Ill, Ill stick with Leonard.","So, uh, what do you say?"
"Say it. Arthur, say it. Say Im annoying. Say it. Say it. Im annoying. Say it.",Good night.,"Its because Im annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say Im annoying."
"Well, that really hurt.",Youre annoying.,"Say it. Arthur, say it. Say Im annoying. Say it. Say it. Im annoying. Say it."
"Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that youre both here.","Im sorry, Dr. Jeffries, Im just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, its really interesting.","If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking."
"Because as it just so happens, Im also spending the day with a beloved childrens television science personality. Isnt that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.",Why is it odd?,"Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that youre both here."
"No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now lets go.",He said Id be speaking to a class.,"Mr. Nye, hello. Im sorry he got you involved in this nonsense."
Arthur?,"Theyre gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.",Thank you. It wasnt easy.
Im surprised to see you here.,"Hi, Sheldon.",Arthur?
Ill get Leonard.,"Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.",Im surprised to see you here.
"If youre hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I cant help you. Ive been informed that hes now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.","No, no, no, Im, Im here, Im here to see you.",Ill get Leonard.
Thank you. It would be an honour.,"No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isnt too much trouble, Id like to get your opinion about my, my paper.","If youre hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I cant help you. Ive been informed that hes now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy."
"Actually, I dont need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.","Oh. Uh, great.",Thank you. It would be an honour.
"Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.","And, what did you think?","Actually, I dont need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
"Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.",Mmm. Thank you.,"Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing."
Can I invite you in for tea?,"Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.","Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired."
"Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?","And thats not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.",Wow.
"Oh, wait here. Ill get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nyes house. As long as Im not within 500 feet of it.",He cant help it. He cant. He really cant.,"Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?"
"Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?",That one over there.,What window?
"Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.",Skee-Ball tickets?,"Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?"
"None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.","Ooh, what are you gonna get?","Uh, if I still have them, theyre probably in the junk box."
"Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.","Yup, oh, here you go.","None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?,"Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.","Aw, did she hate you?"
"Well, you barely looked. Let me see.","Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, theyre not in there.",I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
"Leonard, let me look in the box.","No, no, no, I, I looked, and theres, theres, theres no more tickets.","Well, you barely looked. Let me see."
Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? Its a spider.,"Okay, okay. Im gonna show you whats in the box. But just promise not to flip out.","Leonard, let me look in the box."
"That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?","Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But its been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?","No, if it was a spider, Lenny wouldve flipped out."
Okay.,"Im sorry. Ill, Ill take care of it.","That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?"
I believe you.,"I mean it, Im going to.",Okay.
I said I would.,And youre going to stay calm?,I believe you.
"Okay, first, talking to you while youre on the toilet isnt exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. Its, its like, a, an itch in my brain I cant scratch.","So, when you say youre not going to freak out about the DVD, heres what that means. Dont fixate on it. Dont wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while Im on the toilet.","Yeah, its freaking me out. Im gonna go."
You wouldnt make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.,When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?,"Okay, first, talking to you while youre on the toilet isnt exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. Its, its like, a, an itch in my brain I cant scratch."
"How about this? I promise I wont pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. Thats a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.","Well, I dont know how to do that.",You wouldnt make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
You say its itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.,Thats stupid. Why?,"How about this? I promise I wont pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. Thats a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it."
Put it on. Lets share the experience.,"Im telling you, try the hanger.",You say its itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.
"Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.","You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, Im gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.",Put it on. Lets share the experience.
"How those nipples feeling, chief?",Really?,"Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago."
"Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He cant walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.",Is the point that youre an idiot?,Its called proving a point.
Im thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.,"Hey, whatre you working on?","What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows Im a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  Its Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny."
Yeah. Its great youre here. Id love to get an engineers opinion.,Thats a pretty cool idea.,Im thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
"This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?",Sure.,Yeah. Its great youre here. Id love to get an engineers opinion.
"Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.",Or its resolved.,"You know, you could reimburse the video store owners next of kin."
I dont know why that surprises you. Im a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.,"I must say, Sheldon, youre handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.",So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
"The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?",Is there some kind of new coping mechanism youre employing?,I dont know why that surprises you. Im a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
"Theres nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Dont Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.",Im gonna go with sad. So whats the story with you and this DVD?,"The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
"Please. Ha-ha, Oh.",Seriously?,"Theres nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Dont Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but cant figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?,"I love you, Penny.",Theres a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
Theres probably a deep reason. Which Id be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.,"I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?",How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but cant figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
"Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?","Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.",Theres probably a deep reason. Which Id be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
"Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.","Oh, oh, no, no. Its because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasnt a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but Im not Armenian, so it probably wont work. This is over, right?","Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
"You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.","Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.","Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon."
"Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.",Why isnt this bothering you? Isnt your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isnt this making you crazy?,"You know, it might be fun. You love hummus."
"Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.",What?,"Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out."
"I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.",What?,"Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it."
I know. And it wasnt easy. Do you have any idea what its like to wait for years and never know if youre going to finally get satisfaction?,"Sheldon, that was diabolical.","Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!"
"Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldnt do it.","Yes, it is.",The math is all there. Its not real.
"Mmm. You know, Ive been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so Id love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.","Mmm. Im gonna say not. Thats just based on me trying to roll my mom over when shes snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, shes invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.",Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
"Oh, since you put it that way, Id love to go, but that sounds even more awful.","Please? Bernadettes bringing her dad cause her moms out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.","Uh, we were actually gonna do it here."
"Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?",Itd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.,"Oh, since you put it that way, Id love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
"Ugh, fine, Ill go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and its on you.",Sheldon.,Im in.
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitzs house?,"Ugh, fine, Ill go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and its on you.",Sheldon.
Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.,We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.,Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitzs house?
Yes.,Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitzs moms with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?,Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
Hes right.,"Yeah, they are.","No, theyre not."
"Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?",But it didnt seem real.,Theyre real.
Yes. Like were on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.,"No traffic, were sailing.","Oh, well, thats a great idea."
"Yes, Miss Amy.","Sheldon, thats completely inappropriate. You cant keep comparing yourself to a slave.",Yes. Like were on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
"Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonards proposed, hes gotten a resounding no. Yeah, thats just off the top of my head.",I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?,"Well, a goof or not, youre actually married. You need to get this taken care of."
Hah!Penny? Next.,It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?,"Great, well, what do I have to do?"
"It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know",Happy Thanksgiving.,"You know, my moms been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. Cause shes so fat. Ill get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys."
"I dont know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.","Wuh, Penny.","Ugh, I need some air."
They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.,"Im trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?",Sure.
My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.,How the hell do you know that?,They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
"I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.",What do you think they ought to do now?,Come on.
I dont care for your mothers bathroom. Theres not an angle to do ones business without a clown figurine staring at you.,"My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.",Ooh!
1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.,"Yeah, thats why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?",Thats why I sit.
So was my dad. And then he did.,"I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.",1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
No. He died when I was 14.,"So, does your dad still live in Texas?",Thank God.
So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.,Im sorry to hear that.,No. He died when I was 14.
"No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.","Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.",Here you go.
All right.,"Well, youre having one with me.","No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no."
Do you mind? Were having a moment here.,"I never had a beer with my dad, either.",To your dad.
"All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And theres the clown that came out of her. I really didnt want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings Ive had in a long time.","I dont know whats scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.",Did somebody say pie?
Shes so tiny. Its funny when shes mad.,"Hey. Howie says youve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.","Me, too."
"Perhaps youre right. Im sorry for my behaviour. Ive had alcohol, and its caused me to be inappropriate.","All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.",Shes so tiny. Its funny when shes mad.
Aint she great?,Thank you.,Dont worry about it.
"Now, hows about you get us a couple of beers?",Sheldon.,Mmm.
This is a Jewish house. I dont think they have pigskin.,"Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?","Well, I couldnt have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray."
"Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didnt want to. Uh, big fan of the show.","This is Science Friday. Im Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.","Well, Im drunk."
Yes.,"So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.","Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didnt want to. Uh, big fan of the show."
Who? Give me their names. I bet its Wolowitz.,And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.,Yes.
Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?,"Its just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. Its like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.",Who? Give me their names. I bet its Wolowitz.
"Yes, yes, Id be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I dont need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.","Thats interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldnt that be unusual? Because youre a physicist.",Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
"President Seibert, I dont know why youre yelling. Youre the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that ones worth a dollar.","Yes, yes, Id be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry.

And in chemistry, no less. And wouldnt that be unusual? Because youre a physicist."
"Yeah, well, Im not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.","I know you dont like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.","President Seibert, I dont know why youre yelling. Youre the one who made me go on the radio.

"Look, youre gonna be doing this stuff for a while. Youre just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.","How can you not be happy? Youre tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, Im jealous of Sheldon.",Of course youre not. People love trained monkeys.
But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.,"Look, youre gonna be doing this stuff for a while. Youre just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.","How can you not be happy? Youre tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, Im jealous of Sheldon."
"Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because its a hub.","For a whole week, the nerve of some people.",Hes bringing Cinnamon?
Do you have cookies?,"Sheldon, can I come in?","Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because its a hub."
Good. I dont deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?,No.,Do you have cookies?
Why are you here?,"Hey, Sheldon. Its been a while.",Good. I dont deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
"Certainly. Although, right now, Im having a rough time because theres three people in my room, and its starting to feel like a discotheque.","Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?",Why are you here?
"Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.","Yeah, I know a little something about that.","Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldnt relate to that?,"I remember why its been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.","Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad."
"That just happened to me. Next time youre stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.","Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.",How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldnt relate to that?
I do see what youre saying. That helps.,"Im just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crushers shadow. But now, its just one small part of a pretty great life, and its a part that Im happy is there.","Uh, were trying to cheer him up, so"
Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?,Good.,I do see what youre saying. That helps.
"Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.",Okay.,Sure.
You should probably go.,Can I blow the whistle?,"Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch."
"Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, its ten. Ill count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.",Theres also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And its when youre ten.,Thank you.
Im in a great mood.,"Hey, youre in a good mood.","Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call.

"Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.","Well, youre about to be in an even better one. I didnt want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, Ive been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.",Im in a great mood.
Really?,"Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.","Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it."
So no more interviews?,Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.,Really?
I cant believe it.,"No, its all over.",So no more interviews?
You robbed me of my greatest achievement.,"Well, youre welcome.",I cant believe it.
"Im back down to nine friends. Make it eight, Im sick of Wolowitz, too.",What?,You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
"By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.","I, I dont understand. All youve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.","Im back down to nine friends. Make it eight, Im sick of Wolowitz, too."
"Thats what makes their friendship unlikely,","Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters dont even live near each other.","By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.,"Hey, whats with all the yelling?","Thats what makes their friendship unlikely,"
"Thats it, Im down to seven friends.","Oh, thats great. You must be thrilled,",Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
"When I thought the element was real, I didnt want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.","Hes counting hobbits and superheroes, right?","Thats it, Im down to seven friends."
"Dont you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, Im back up to eight.","The, the element never existed. I didnt take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.","When I thought the element was real, I didnt want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world."
"Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.","Actually, I get what hes saying.",Will you tell him hes out of his mind.
"I have no idea what shes talking about, but were ganging up on you so I agree.","Its like if youre dating someone youre not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.","Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy."
"No, no, of course you have to publish. Thats your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.","Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I dont publish it, its just a matter of time before someone else does.","I have no idea what shes talking about, but were ganging up on you so I agree."
Can you believe this guy?,"Fine, Ill publish.","No, no, of course you have to publish. Thats your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice."
I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.,"Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.","So, yes."
Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.,"These things happen all the time, Sheldon.",I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
"No, no, no, thats okay. I can fight my own battles. Isnt that right, Bawwy.","Okay, Barry, thats enough.","Its a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isnt your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving."
"Youre right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.","Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? Thats pwetty hurtful. I, I cant contwol it.","No, no, no, thats okay. I can fight my own battles. Isnt that right, Bawwy."

"Thank you. Ira, if I may, Id like to apologize for my behaviour last week.",Thanks.,"Im Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. Id like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

"Now, isnt there something youd like to say to me?",Its all right.,"Thank you. Ira, if I may, Id like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
I believe I can answer that.,Well,"No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?"
Fine.,He asked me.,I believe I can answer that.
"Youre telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named",As I was saying,Fine.
"Thats right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbours dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldnt build because Santa wouldnt bring him enriched uranium.",Sheldon.,"Youre telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning.

What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?,"You know, Id really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if its okay with you.","Thats right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbours dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldnt build because Santa wouldnt bring him enriched uranium."
"Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.","Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.","Actually, I didnt invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and Im not comfortable with confrontation."
"You know, I dont just say smart things about science. I also yodel.","A little early for alcohol, isnt it?","You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
"Oh, I would, but Im on my way out.","Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?","Oh, I hope its just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury."
Texas.,Where?,"Oh, I would, but Im on my way out."
Yes. My sisters uterus came down with a baby.,Is someone sick?,Right now? Why?
"No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.","Oh, shes pregnant? Thats great. Youre gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.",Yes. My sisters uterus came down with a baby.
"Well, I never told you about my brothers kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my familys genitals?",How come you never said she was pregnant?,"No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper."
Yes. Im filling in for her husband whos recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.,"Well, congrats, and its nice youre gonna be there for your sister.","Well, I never told you about my brothers kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my familys genitals?"

"No, its not. Ive seen things. Lady things.","Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?",The end.
Doesnt matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. Its some kind of dirty magic show.,Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.,"No, its not. Ive seen things. Lady things."

"Actually, much better.","Hows it going, Sheldon?",I was okay with it.
I dont know. I just got back.,"Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?","Actually, much better."

Thats it. The babys here. Its a boy.,"Hows it going, Sheldon?",Ill stop now.

"Yay, Penny.","Oh, yeah",What? Thats great. Guys.
Why is that funny? Thats just unhygienic.,"If youre really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.",I dont see why not.
"I dont think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitzs mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both.

Cant sleep?,Smooth.,"Okay, nice talking to you."
Would you like to talk about it?,No.,Cant sleep?
Why not?,"Penny proposed, and I didnt say yes.",Would you like to talk about it?
Does that mean the relationship is over?,Thats a good question.,Why not?
Why dont you ask her?,I dont know.,Does that mean the relationship is over?
"Well, Im sorry.",Because Im afraid to know the answer.,Why dont you ask her?
"No. Youre my friend, and, Im sorry.",Thats it? Youre not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?,"Well, Im sorry."

"Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.",Which is stronger than ever.,"Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship."
Um.,"But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.","Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was."
I dont need to explain myself to you!,You dont need to explain yourself to him.,Um.
Keep the table. We dont use that space.,Youre sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.,I dont need to explain myself to you!
"No, thanks. Were fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then thats what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how weve always done things. But if those days are gone, theyre gone. It just makes me sad.",So why are you trying to ruin it?,"Yeah, its fun up here."
How about Pennys depressing acting career?,Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?,"Hey, thats my wife. If anyones gonna make her feel gross about sex, its me."
She does. 42 minutes in.,Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.,Because it was crap. Its a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
I have an eidetic memory. I dont know what his problem is.,"While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.",She does. 42 minutes in.
"Am I missing something, or isnt that the part she was born to play?","Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the apes DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.",I have an eidetic memory. I dont know what his problem is.
Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didnt get to tap the juicy vein that is Howards.,I think were gonna go.,"I dont know anything about show business, so if you think its reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, Im sure you know what youre doing."
"Yes, and Hawkeyes in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.","Hey, I work at the same university you do.",Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didnt get to tap the juicy vein that is Howards.
"Well, with that sorted out, Im happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.","No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that youd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now its a fight.",I think were gonna go.
"I wasnt referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.",I didnt do anything. I was just sitting here.,"Well, with that sorted out, Im happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it."
"Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.",That was ten years ago.,Ha-a-a. Still funny.
"In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.",I was there. It was funny.,The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. Thats funny.

"Thats a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.","Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.",Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and youve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?,"Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette cant go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and Ill show you around the space centre.","Thats a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it."

"It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.","Im sorry, is the fact that my lifes falling apart interfering with your board game?","Leonard, would you wrap it up? Were waiting on you."

Like when?,"Im trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.",Why are you getting annoyed?
"Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.","When? How about in the car? Im an astronaut, and you know it. You just dont like admitting it, because youre jealous.",Like when?
Because it made me realize theyll just send anyone up there. Arent you going to let me out?,Thank you.,"Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me."

I take it back. Im scared of turbulence!,"Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.","No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. Im not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are."
Im sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.,"Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.","You know, I think Im just gonna go by myself."

Or what?,"I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.","Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allens finest sofas."

What did you do?,"Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.",I didnt know she did.
"Im sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.","Well, lets just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El.

I am.,"Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?",Hello.

"Because Im trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, whyd I say that?",Why not?,I cant.
"Im not being stupid. Im employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.","Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?","Because Im trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4.

Here come the waterworks.,"I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.","Oh, thats great."
"So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. Youd think after Xbox, thered be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe thats how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.","Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu Im not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.","All right, heres your chance."
"You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands.

"Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.",Included?,"No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included."
See? Thats what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.,Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?,"Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory."
Xbox.,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Whos they?",See? Thats what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.

"Yeah, well, Ive had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.","Oh, I dont know.

"Oh, yeah, well, Ive already given this some thought, and Im willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when shes made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.","Well, well, we might want to live together.",What do you mean?
I dont understand. How could we all live together if Im not there?,Thats very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with not you.,"Oh, yeah, well, Ive already given this some thought, and Im willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period.

Where are you going to go?,"Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.",I dont understand. How could we all live together if Im not there?
Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?,"I dont know. We just started to think about this. Maybe Ill move in with Penny, or maybe she and Ill take this place, and you can move across the hall.",Where are you going to go?
Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?,"No, I did not.",Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
"Well, then, Im all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?",No.,Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
I see. Youre putting your future brides happiness above mine.,"Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.","Well, then, Im all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?"
Wow.,"Well, yeah.",I see. Youre putting your future brides happiness above mine.
How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?,Wow.,"Well, yeah."
"Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.",They just dont appreciate you.,How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
"I have real problems here, Amy. I cant be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.","Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.","Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more."
"Ugh, its like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.","You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, youre always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when youre not there.","I have real problems here, Amy. I cant be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy."
"Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?",You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.,"Ugh, its like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes."
I dont know. Perhaps.,See? Maybe youll love living alone.,"Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?"
"You and oh, sure, and while were at it, why dont we get engaged, too? Why dont we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?","And if it turns out you dont, you and I could live together.",I dont know. Perhaps.
"No. Heres a thought. Youre not moving in, Leonards not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, youre supposed to use the powder.","Sheldon, it was just a thought.","You and oh, sure, and while were at it, why dont we get engaged, too?

No. The syrup tastes better and I dont like it.,It tastes the same.,"No. Heres a thought. Youre not moving in, Leonards not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, youre supposed to use the powder."
No.,Right.,"Amy, get out."
What happened?,"Hey, Sheldon.",No.
And you couldnt put it out?,I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.,What happened?
So when will you reopen?,"I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.",And you couldnt put it out?
"So, tomorrow?","Um, I dont know. Im waiting to hear back from the insurance company.",So when will you reopen?
"Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when Im sad is damp and smells funny.","I dont mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.","So, tomorrow?"
"No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. Im helping you get back on your feet.

Really? Its soaking wet.,Thatll be 2.99.,"No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. Im helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please."
Can you break a twenty?,"Fine, a dollar.",Really? Its soaking wet.
"You know what? I dont always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I dont appreciate it. Im sorry for your loss. But youre not the only one whose day has been a disaster.","No, I only have hundreds.",Can you break a twenty?
You tracked my phone?,Sheldon.,So whats the catch?
"Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.",Yeah.,You tracked my phone?
Dont be melodramatic. Im just getting on a train and leaving forever.,We were worried about you.,"Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles."
My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. Its called living off the land.,Seriously? You dont even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.,Dont be melodramatic. Im just getting on a train and leaving forever.
No. Ive reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.,"Okay, I know youre upset and theres a lot of stuff going on, but its nothing we cant work out. Come on, lets get you home.",My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. Its called living off the land.
It doesnt matter.,And go where?,No. Ive reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And Id sooner die than eat beans out of a can.,So a few things dont go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?,It doesnt matter.
Legoland is not the solution to everything. And its too much of a scene since that movie came out.,"Come on, come home with us and tomorrow Ill, Ill take you to Legoland.",I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And Id sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
"Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and its simply too much. I need to get away and think.",Then what can I do?,Legoland is not the solution to everything. And its too much of a scene since that movie came out.
"Good Lord. Padawans the student, not the teacher.","Hell be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.","I know, but"
I do.,"Sheldon, if you really need to do this, Im not gonna stand in your way.","Seriously, let him go."
I will.,Be safe and call us.,Okay. Good luck.
Yes?,"Bye, buddy. Sheldon?",I will.
Of course you are.,Im gonna miss you.,Yes?
"Excuse me. Is it at all possible that youre knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, youre understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?","Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from",I really think this is gonna be for the best.
"Yeah, well, I understand that Im half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. Ill have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask.

"Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?",I said well past it.,"Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active"
"Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?",Not yet.,"Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?"

"I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.","What do you mean, why did I come? Youre my boyfriend. I havent seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Dont you have anything to say besides why did you come?","Oh, Im fine. Why did you come?"

"Where didnt I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.","So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Whered you go?",Shotgun.
"Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.",How were they?,"Where didnt I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle."
Why would I? Thats where all the cool trains are.,Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?,"Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station."

"Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?","Im mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?",I just thought you were bad at the game.
"Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but thatll work. Please? Thisll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she cant hear. The reason I called you is because I didnt want Amy to know I couldnt make it on my own.",Were in a moving car. What do you expect me to do?

I called Leonard because I failed. And I didnt want you to think less of me.,Just tell her.,Can I stop now?
Yes.,You were worried about that?,I called Leonard because I failed. And I didnt want you to think less of me.
Can I have one more moment with Leonard?,"Sheldon, its okay with me that youre not perfect.",Yes.
Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.,Sure.,Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
I wish Id never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.,"Thats right, sucka.","Yeah, in my house."
That I couldnt do it?,"Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?",But you still accomplished something.
"Thats a good point. You know, Im a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, cause I wasnt in direct sunlight for six weeks.",But you did do it. So what if it didnt all go your way? Thats what makes it an adventure.,Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
"Indeed. I was the worlds smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nations railway system, Ive burst forth as the worlds smartest butterfly.",See? This trip was good for you.,"Thats a good point. You know, Im a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White.

This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.",And you thought they all had a silver lining.,"Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud."
"I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.",I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.,"Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didnt because there were cracker crumbs on it.

"Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldnt be attacked.","Yes, but when theyre hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.","Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."
The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.,"But half-man, half-owl could fly","Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldnt be attacked."
"Im sensing awkwardness, am I right?",I said Ill get to it.,Great. When?

It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.,"Mm, I dont know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teachers pet?",Couldnt hurt.
Guess who?,It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.,"Mm, I dont know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teachers pet?"
"Thats right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?",Dr. Cooper.,Guess who?
Thank you. I assume youd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?,"Yes. Uh, welcome back.","Thats right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?"

"Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?","Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.","Thats the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?"
"But if Im a professor, then Ill have to teach a class.","Currently, youre being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, youll be able to choose whatever field of research youd like.","Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?"
So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?,That is correct.,"But if Im a professor, then Ill have to teach a class."
You people are sick.,Yes.,So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?

What a stupid question.,I dont understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?,"Awful. Theyre allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class."
I cant believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is whats in their diapers.,The kids are gonna love him.,What a stupid question.

"It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. Thats rich.

"I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.","Well, thats not your fault.",No one signed up.
"No, its fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.","Hey, Sheldon, Im sorry.",What?
"Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them theyre wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts.

No.,"Sheldon, Im more than smart enough to take your class.","Ask why not again, Ive got an answer."
How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?,Yes.,No.
"Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?",I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.,How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
"Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?","Id use Feynmans trick, differentiate under the integral sign.","Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?"
No.,"Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so Ill say that. Now do you think Im smart enough?","Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
You take that back.,"Oh, come on. You mightve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.",No.

I told you you werent smart enough to take it.,"Well, I dropped your class, so I hope youre happy.",You violated the sanctity of my mouth.

"Oh. Well, then come or dont. I dont care.",You are aware that a double date doesnt count as two dates.,Aw.
"At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.","Sheldon, Im surprised youd choose to go to a pub.",Whats wrong with the way I run?
"Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.",I then suggested a pub.,"At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon."
"No, its yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.",You dont even like Yorkshire pudding.,"Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding."
"Ignore them, Amy. Theyre just jealous because theyll never have a relationship as good as ours.",Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.,"After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin."
"I wasnt making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.",Isnt this when he says bazooka or something?,"Ignore them, Amy. Theyre just jealous because theyll never have a relationship as good as ours."
"Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.","You dont honestly think that, do you?","I wasnt making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours."
"For starters, we enjoy spending time together.","Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isnt?",You realize this isnt one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
Its called parallel play.,So do we. And Ive seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.,"For starters, we enjoy spending time together."
Not as well as we do.,"Yeah, toddlers do that.",Its called parallel play.
"Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoons over.",So what? Why do you even care?,You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
"If youve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, Id like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.",Whatever. You cant even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.,"Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoons over."
May I have one of your fries?,"Uh, were not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother Im not pregnant.",So when do you guys plan on getting married?
Absolutely not.,Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?,May I have one of your fries?
It has avocado on it. Shes allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?,Some perfect couple. He wont even share his food with her.,Absolutely not.
"Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.",Im not jealous. I just think its silly for you to compare relationships like theyre something that can be quantified.,It has avocado on it. Shes allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
"No, Im not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, Id order a clown wig.","Sheldon, youre just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.",A hundred.
"Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.","Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.","No, Im not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, Id order a clown wig."
"Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. Thats pure Cooper.","They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.","Oh, what did those rascals do now?"
"Its been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.","So, this is accurate?","Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. Thats pure Cooper."
Kind of? It does it perfectly.,"Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.","Its been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
"Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.","No, were sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.","Hey, sorry about that."
"The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, its like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.",I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that were a bad couple.,"Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge."
Or a one. A one is possible.,Because it doesnt matter. I dont care if were a ten or a two.,"Oh, well, cause you know were gonna do bad."
"We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, youre happy.",It would make me so happy if you said things like that.,Leonard.
Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.,"This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.","Look at you, talking sports."
"I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickeys Soundsational Parade.","Sheldon, what did you expect?",Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
Whos the bobblehead of?,"Ill tell you what. If we stay, Ill buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.","I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickeys Soundsational Parade."
"No, as long as it bobbles.",Does it matter?,Whos the bobblehead of?
"Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyers Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.",Cause Im an idiot who didnt think this through.,Why is it going so slow?
He makes a valid point.,"You suck, Wolowitz!","Okay, while were waiting for the ball to arrive, heres some fun facts about Mars."
"Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.",Have you guys heard about this research team thats trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?,He makes a valid point.
"Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldnt hit the Mesozoic spot.",What? Youre afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.,"Oh, I think that sounds wonderful."
Hello.,Hey.,"Hey, guys."
"Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.",Yeah. Im excited to finally meet your girlfriend.,We still on for tomorrow night?
I go to the bathroom like everybody else.,Since when do you read social science?,"Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends."
Hello.,"Hey, guys.","Long story short, they have seven HBOs."
"Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you dont have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.","Uh, yeah, Im a resident at Huntington Hospital.","Hey, I hear youre a dermatologist."
I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?,Yeah. Im sure thatd be fine.,"Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
"I miss Stuarts place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pigs house?","Id say it now, but look at those cheekbones.",Yeah.
"Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, its those dad-gum insurance companies.","You know, he might not reopen. He didnt get a lot of money from the insurance company.","Yes, I am. You know, I cant even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?"
"For starters, they shed and bite.","All I know is, hes got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesnt he just use an angora rabbit?","Why? Because they wont get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?"
"Ill give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.","Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.",That does sound fun.
"So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?",No. Yeah.,"So, it was a hook-up."
"Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?","Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?","You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride."
Yes.,"Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?","Toy stores, puppet shows."
"On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who youre going to lose next.",Great.,"Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh."
No. Youre crazy about me.,"You, okay? Its you. Youre, youre next.","On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who youre going to lose next."
"You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.",Shh. Amys here now.,"Oh, my God. I didnt used to like you."
"And well get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isnt a library, buy it or get out.",Well get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.,"You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store."
"Yes, but as a store owner, Ill finally have a good comeback to, You dont work here, shut up.",You say things like that all the time.,"And well get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isnt a library, buy it or get out."
Im sure she did.,"Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?",Yeah.
"Because if she hadnt, shed still be wading through the list.",Why?,Im sure she did.
If only Penny had said that once in a while.,Will you stay out of this?,"Because if she hadnt, shed still be wading through the list."
"Yeah, hes right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.","Yeah, and Im not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.",Thats true.
"I know that if I had a wife or a fiance, Id ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.",Why are you even part of this conversation? You dont know anything about women.,"Yeah, hes right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon."
"Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.",Hes right.,"I know that if I had a wife or a fiance, Id ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store."
Id like your honest opinion on something.,Thats how much buying a comic book store means to me.,"Oh, baby. That storys made up, isnt it?"
"Now, before I start, I need you to know that Im very excited about this, and anything you say that isnt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.",Of course.,Id like your honest opinion on something.
"Perfect. Now, Im considering investing in Stuarts comic book store.","Im feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.","Now, before I start, I need you to know that Im very excited about this, and anything you say that isnt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind."
No.,"Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?","Perfect. Now, Im considering investing in Stuarts comic book store."
Great. Wait till you hear about our van.,Then I think its a terrific idea.,No.
"It wouldve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.",I know. I was looking forward to it.,Im really disappointed were not gonna have our own comic book store.
"Well, I guess it was too good to be true.",And snacks.,With comfy seats.
"I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.","Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.",We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seusss death.,Thats not what happened.,"I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town."
"Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.",No one wants to hear it.,I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seusss death.
"Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?",Penny is not the reason I didnt pursue that idea.,"Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old."
"Well, dont feel bad. I think weve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.",I think someone owes me an apology.,"And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up."
"Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope youre having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?",You admit Amys a distraction?,"Well, dont feel bad. I think weve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives."
Im not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?,My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.,"Ooh, we could have one of those retreats."
A hotel? Did you see The Shining?,Then well go to a hotel.,Im not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
Did you see The Lake House?,We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.,A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
"Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.",Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.,Did you see The Lake House?
"Well, you didnt suggest a beach house.",Fine. Then well just stay here and do it.,"Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet."
"Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?",You would go to a beach house?,"Well, you didnt suggest a beach house."
"Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.","For your information, Emily is working tonight.","Well, cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed youd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
Thinking caps on.,"Okay, lets focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Lets change the world.","Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit."
Really?,Oh. I never saw that.,"Ooh, this is exciting. Were innovating. I feel like were in the Facebook movie."
"Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.","Oh. Its wonderful, and I swear Im not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.",Really?
Im sorry. Is that a no?,"Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from lets change the world to lets watch TV.",Cool. Ill make the popcorn.
I did not get a clear answer. Im gonna set this down now.,"I, I think I still have it.",Okay. No. Leonards right. Were here to focus. Didnt we used to have a list of all our ideas?
Wait. Im confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?,Also mine.,Robot prostitute.
"You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And Ive long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.","You know, lets just come up with something new.","No, it vibrates. Keep going."
"If we could figure out the scientific basis for Martys hover board, that would have universal application.",How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?,"Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie havent been invented yet."
I think I have the same one.,"Oh, I have an idea.","Well, its, its possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
"Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?","This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasnt until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.","Hold on. Pause. Something doesnt make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in."
Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?,What do you mean?,"Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?"
Thats my boy.,Had will have placed?,Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
"Yeah, but he had will havent placed it!","Okay, so, it wasnt until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. Thats when he altered the timeline.",Thats my boy.
"Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldnt be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isnt the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine",What?,"Yeah, but he had will havent placed it!"
Marty and Doc never had have had brought?,Wait. Is brought right?,"Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldnt be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isnt the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine"
"Oh, Im going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasnt, never had have hasnt.",I dont know. You did it to me.,Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
"Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?",Guys.,"Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies."
I dont think it worked.,"Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.",Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
"Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.",All right.,"No, no, its okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick."
"Well, I wonder if anyones tried that.","Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.","So, Ive been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe theres a way we could use Maglev technology."
"Yeah, hes right. Oh, heres a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?",Im sure Mrs. Floridas walking funny. Can we get back to work?,"Thats nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is."
"Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?",Like behavior modification?,"Yeah, hes right. Oh, heres a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?"
"Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scolds bridle. Its an iron cage thats locked around the head and pierces the tongue.",We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.,Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
"Oh, Ill check Amazon.",If only we had one.,"Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scolds bridle. Its an iron cage thats locked around the head and pierces the tongue."
"Wait, a question, who decides if someones gone off topic?","All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling",And I really cant let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think Ive been cheating on her.
Ow. We didnt vote!,"I think itll be pretty clear. If not, well take a vote. Oh, and also","Wait, a question, who decides if someones gone off topic?"
You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. Thats a tangent and its your fault.,"We didnt have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If were leaning towards quantum coupling Aah! Why?",Ow. We didnt vote!
Ow. That was your fault.,Thank you. And now I owe you one.,"Thats ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent."
I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. Its a common mistake.,Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isnt working.,"Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now Im gonna hear it from Jenny."
"Oh, its used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.",Negative reinforcement is really wrong?,I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. Its a common mistake.
Leonards right. We cant just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.,No.,Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
But we didnt see them bust one ghost.,Its late. Weve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?,"Yeah, sorry for clicking on that."
No.,"So youre, youre saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?",But we didnt see them bust one ghost.
"Oh, yeah, Id have to say its the most exiting time in the history of the field.","Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?","Okay, good."
I started doing it.,Oh. Whats going on?,"Oh, yeah, Id have to say its the most exiting time in the history of the field."
Why not?,"Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?","You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
Perhaps the emotion youre referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.,You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.,Why not?
Are they making fun of us?,"Yeah, itll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.",Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
I miss the old days when I couldnt tell.,Yup.,Are they making fun of us?
"Im always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, Im attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, Im composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when Ive solved the Penrose conjecture, and Im wondering how mermaids have babies.","Hey, Sheldon, you busy?","Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."
Now Ive got room for another thing. What do you want?,Dont they lay eggs on a rock?,"Im always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking.

Yeah? We have to be somewhere.,"Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.","Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next."
"So its settled, were not doing it.","Well, theres no toilets, well have to do our business in a bucket.",Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
Interesting. Youre suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.,"Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.","So its settled, were not doing it."
Very well.,Exactly.,Interesting. Youre suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
"Well, Ill just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.",So where should we do it?,Very well.
"Oh, there, well, look, theres all kinds of videos.","Uh, Sheldon","Well, Ill just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up."
"Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.",No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.,Did you get in?
"Plus, theres almost no chance well see any of our coworkers half naked.",This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.,"Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines."
"All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, Ill contact you. And if anything bad happens, whats the rule?","Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.","Plus, theres almost no chance well see any of our coworkers half naked."
"Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets.

"Uh, lets see. 704? No, wait, its on clock. Uh, the real answer isnt much better. 102 degrees.",How hot is it?,"Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know."
"True. Sheldons Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappalis restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.","Well, thats what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.","Uh, lets see. 704? No, wait, its on clock. Uh, the real answer isnt much better. 102 degrees."
Good. Little claustrophobic.,How you feeling?,Like I would swing with him.
Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.,Lets set up the equipment. Itll help take your mind off of it.,Good. Little claustrophobic.

Thats preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?,"So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I dont have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.","I usually dont like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."

"And since youre green this time, I can be it next time.",Thank you.,"Fine. Now that were not playing, you can be green."

"Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, shes trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are.

Hey, I thought you were staying home.","You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. Its not strange."
"According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety.

Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
"If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?","Im sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.","Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and youve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth."
I dont think youre taking this seriously.,"Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.","If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"
I believe what youre doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.,"Come on, Im just having some fun with you.",I dont think youre taking this seriously.
Ha. Keep dreaming.,"Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.",I believe what youre doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
When are we going to get robot eyes?,"Well, I cant read peoples minds. Actually, thats not true, I can read mens minds, but only cause its usually the one thing.","Im sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, thats how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read peoples minds."
"Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I cant always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if theyre mad at something Ive done or just in a bad mood. It, its incredibly stressful.",Youre all alike.,When are we going to get robot eyes?
"Well, Im not. And if I could read peoples minds, life would be so much simpler.",Really? You always seem so confident.,"Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I cant always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if theyre mad at something Ive done or just in a bad mood. It, its incredibly stressful."
Thank you.,"Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.","Well, Im not. And if I could read peoples minds, life would be so much simpler."
You sure its not too much Bible juice?,"Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.",Thank you.
"So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose theres something satisfying about dying on my birthday.","If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?",Remember that before you post on Yelp.
Yes.,Todays your birthday?,"So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose theres something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
"Well, I dont enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Directors Cut.","Well, thats always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.",Yes.
The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.,"So, why did you finally tell me?","Well, I dont enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Directors Cut."
Thank you.,"Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I wont tell anyone.",The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
Youre making it difficult to love you right now.,That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.,Thank you.
Thats it. Were done with the questions.,"Oh, no. That things gonna end up in my bedroom.",Ma? Im sorry I didnt take you to the airport. I just want you to know that Ill never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
"Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. Were good to go.",All thats left to do is stare into each others eyes for four minutes without talking.,Thats it. Were done with the questions.
Yes.,You ready?,"Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. Were good to go."
Were not supposed to talk during this part.,And begin. This is kind of creepy.,Yes.

Im like a human bowl of tomato soup.","Aw, sweetie, Im comfortable around you, too.","Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car.

"Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.",I meant more like a little brother.,"Of course you are, Im warm and soothing. Im like a human bowl of tomato soup."
What?,Its getting creepy again.,"Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother."
It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.,Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.,What?
"Yeah, and youre still eating our food.",Can you believe its been eight years?,It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
"I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If youre interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.",I cant remember a time you guys werent in my life.,"Yeah, and youre still eating our food."
"No, it wasnt. Uh, now lets tabulate the results of the experiment. I think its safe to say that youre not in love with me and Im not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.",Thats it. That wasnt so bad.,"I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If youre interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food."
"And I, you. And yes, thats how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, Id say we have some hard choices to make.","Well, maybe. But Im still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.","No, it wasnt. Uh, now lets tabulate the results of the experiment. I think its safe to say that youre not in love with me and Im not in love with you.

"Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?",Like what?,"And I, you. And yes, thats how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, Id say we have some hard choices to make."
Thank you for walking me home.,"Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?",Like what?
"Well, this is me. Its been a very interesting evening.",I just want to make sure you get there safe.,Thank you for walking me home.
"Oh, good. Youre back.",Hi.,Hey.
"As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.",Okay.,We have some exciting news.
Do you want to say it?,Okay.,"After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward."
Sarcasm?,This is why Ive been saying we should keep champagne on ice.,Were getting a turtle.
"Okay. That was tricky, cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.",Yes.,Sarcasm?
"No. Its true. It means that we care so much about each other, theres enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.",Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.,Yes.
"After much deliberation, weve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They dont shed fur, they dont make noise.",Why a turtle?,"No. Its true. It means that we care so much about each other, theres enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile."
"Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, thats also why I chose you as a roommate.","For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.","After much deliberation, weve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They dont shed fur, they dont make noise."
"Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.","Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.","Oh, good."
That was a lot of puppies.,Its okay. You made it. Were fine.,"Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord."
"Oh, I dont know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?","Lets forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?",That was a lot of puppies.
"I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. Howd you like to come home with us? Youll be living with me because we dont live in the same house.","Well, hes barely moving. He looks half dead.","Oh, I dont know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?"
Or if they accept Daddys application to live on Mars.,"But thats not your fault. Like you, were taking it ridiculously slow. Youll stay with me when hes at Comic-Con or away for work.","I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. Howd you like to come home with us? Youll be living with me because we dont live in the same house."
"Oh, theres this company thats attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.",What are you talking about?,Or if they accept Daddys application to live on Mars.
Would you have approved?,"You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldnt be bothered to tell me?","Oh, theres this company thats attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian."
"Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isnt that right, Giuseppe?",Of course not.,Would you have approved?
I cant believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.,"Yeah. You get the paint, Ill rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.","Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this."
I was playing Got Your Nose. Thats how you get children to like you.,No one told you to poke the turtles face.,I cant believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
"Ugh, this again. Amy, Ive already had one new hole torn in my body today. I dont need another one.","Im surprised you even care if he likes you, since youre planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.",I was playing Got Your Nose. Thats how you get children to like you.
So youre saying you wouldnt leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?,"Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.","Ugh, this again. Amy, Ive already had one new hole torn in my body today. I dont need another one."
"Huh, thats exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.",I would at least mention it before filling out the application.,So youre saying you wouldnt leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
"First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.","And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.","Huh, thats exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said."
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?,"You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.","First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application."
What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?,No. Forget it.,Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
"Yep, youre mad.",Please dont.,What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
"I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.",Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?,Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
"Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?",Why do you even want to do this?,"I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint."
But I made a video.,Cant you just tell me?,"Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?"
"Im Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and Id like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. Im exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin cant take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals dont trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?",But I made a video.,Cant you just tell me?
Yes. Open it and check.,You mean this weirdly suspicious one?,"Im Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and Id like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. Im exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14.

In fact, animals dont trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
"But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, its my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.",I dont get it. Theres actually peanut brittle in Please go to Mars.,Yes. Open it and check.
"Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.","But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, its my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward.

Why? I really dont understand whats happening here.,I think Im gonna go home.,"God, I love you. I love you so much."
"Amy. Oh, why didnt I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.","You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.",Why? I really dont understand whats happening here.
Do you want me to withdraw my application?,Sure. Unless something better comes along.,"Amy. Oh, why didnt I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too."
"And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because Ive seen people make the long-distance thing work.",What I want is for us to be planning our future together.,Do you want me to withdraw my application?
Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?,Were on the same planet.,"And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because Ive seen people make the long-distance thing work."
"I am. Yeah, if Im going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why dont we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?",Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?,Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
"Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?",Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.,"I am. Yeah, if Im going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why dont we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?"
"You just cant keep it in your space pants, can you?","You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.","Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?"
"They would, wouldnt they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?","Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.","You just cant keep it in your space pants, can you?"
"Good idea. And since youve had such a rough day, Im gonna let you throw the pie in Leonards face.","I guess well have to make a new video together, as a couple.","They would, wouldnt they?

"Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.","I promise. Why, whats in there?",You promise you didnt look in the closet?
"Oh, look, its the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.","Id say Im sorry I asked, except I didnt.","Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places."
I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.,"Oh, let me see.","Oh, look, its the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote."
"Well, that cant be right.","Sheldon, this article doesnt mention Leonard at all.",I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesnt include any of those smelly perfume cards.,It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?,"Well, that cant be right."
Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.,Poor Leonard.,All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesnt include any of those smelly perfume cards.
"Oh, maybe youre right. He is kind of a lump.",He might not be.,Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
"Oh, Id be incensed.",Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonards team?,"Oh, maybe youre right. He is kind of a lump."
Squeaky wheel gets the grease?,So you see what Im getting at?,"Oh, Id be incensed."
Grass is always greener?,No.,Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
"Well, I dont know, were all Groot? Just tell me.",Try again.,Grass is always greener?
But it wasnt my fault. I didnt exclude him. And I didnt write the article.,"Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. Hes going to feel bad.","Well, I dont know, were all Groot? Just tell me."
"Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.",Remember that time you didnt get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?,But it wasnt my fault. I didnt exclude him. And I didnt write the article.
"For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.",Exactly.,"Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard."
Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?,"Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobodys looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.",Is that why you couldnt get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
"Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isnt. And Im okay with that.",Yeah.,Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
"Oh, right. This is a disaster.","Actually, your name is on the electric bill.","Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isnt. And Im okay with that."
"Okay, I have to tell you something, but youre not going to like it.",I dont even know what youre talking about and I agree.,"Oh, right. This is a disaster."

"No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldnt say enough nice things about it.",Did they hate it?,An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
You know how the PennySaver only has my name,So whats the problem?,"No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldnt say enough nice things about it."

"I know. Its not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Lets keep those tight.",Really?,They didnt mention you in the article. Only me.
"It is. Theyre what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldnt read it. Itll only make you feel worse.","Uh, that, thats not necessary.","I know. Its not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Lets keep those tight."
You should know I had nothing to do with that.,Cooper and his team?,"It is. Theyre what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldnt read it. Itll only make you feel worse."
"You know, youre right. Yeah. You know, its like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and hes far richer. And hes a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.","Uh, at least theyre talking about the theory. I mean, thats whats important.",You should know I had nothing to do with that.
"Well, Id give more examples, but, well, everyone in your positions so forgettable.",Thats not helping.,"You know, youre right. Yeah.

Leonard?,Babys listening.,It does have a camera in it.
I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.,What?,Leonard?
I did.,What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?,I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.,Thank you. What did he say?,I did.
"Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said hes been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is cause my name is on it.","You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.",Why did he think youre the lead scientist? It was my idea.
Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?,"If youre trying to make me feel better, its not working.",You know what? I did it. Whats four bucks?
"Oh. Thats just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so Im ready whenever you are.",No.,Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?

"Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why wont Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.","Well, that is an important part.",All he had was an idea.
"Fine. Then Grumpy, whats he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend wont take his side.",But Leonards idea was good.,"Oh, please. I have ideas all day long.

"Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.",All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.,Thats not true. Weve got tomatoes right here.
"Oh, Im aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek","Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.","Oh, so its like The View."
I dont believe it matters what the topic is. Whats crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. Its all about the execution.,"Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.",I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
"Yeah, good for you, Leonard. Thats a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, its your uncle. He says you just got burned.","Oh, thats fine.","Of course youd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. Whats more important, an idea or its execution?"
"Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, itll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.","Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.","No, its okay. Were all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?"

"Yeah, so are you.",Youre being ridiculous.,"Leonard, please. His mother just died."
"Leonard, lots of people couldve had that idea, but very few people couldve worked out the math the way I did.","Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, Id go to my real salon.","Yeah, so are you."

Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.,"Right now, Im just trying to burp without throwing up.",So glad you two are done fighting.
They did.,Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?,Whatd they say?
"Leonard, Ive been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.","Good news, I found more Tums.",Yay.
"Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? Ill have fries with that. Because his education hasnt prepared him for a career in the sciences.","Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.","Leonard, Ive been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley."
"Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.",Are you all set for your trip?,"You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon."
I dont see whats crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.,Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.,PRK?
"And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign.

I cant spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
"We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.",We havent been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.,I dont want to play anymore.
"I suppose it is. In fact, if youd like to celebrate with a little music, Id be okay with that.","No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? Thats pretty cool.","We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging."
"Play that funky music, white boy.",What? This road trip just got crazy.,"I suppose it is. In fact, if youd like to celebrate with a little music, Id be okay with that."
What reference?,Im surprised you know that reference.,"Play that funky music, white boy."
"So theyre requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?",Of course.,"Well, I guess as long as youre keeping an open mind."
And this music were listening to right now is funky as well?,Yes.,"So theyre requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?,Sure.,And this music were listening to right now is funky as well?
"So its like the musical equivalent of Russells Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that dont contain themselves as members contains itself?",It could be.,Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.,Exactly.,"So its like the musical equivalent of Russells Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that dont contain themselves as members contains itself?"
Will our hotel room be ready?,Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.,Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
Arent you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?,I doubt it.,Will our hotel room be ready?
"Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we wont be very far from Skywalker Ranch.","If we do, well just tell him to hit the bricks, see?",Arent you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
Why not?,"Oh, thats true. Its not like we can get in there.","Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we wont be very far from Skywalker Ranch."
"Yodas swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. Thats code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.",I dont think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.,Why not?
"Yes. Oh, Im so excited. And I just cant hide it.","We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.","Yodas swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. Thats code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in."
What are you talking about?,"Im about to lose control, and I think I like it.","Yes. Oh, Im so excited. And I just cant hide it."
There it is. Its just a gate. On a road.,"If you still have that bra, Ill give you a nickel for it.",So its settled. The fate of Doctor Whos TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.
This is so amazing.,Wasnt even that hard to find.,There it is. Its just a gate. On a road.
I want more than a picture. I want to go in.,I know. You want to get a picture?,This is so amazing.
Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?,"Well, so do I, but theyll never let us.",I want more than a picture. I want to go in.
"Theres a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and lets see what happens.","No, but I dont have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.",Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
"Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.","Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? Im a little nervous.","Theres a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and lets see what happens."
"You pushed it, are you out of your mind?",Right.,"Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations."
Youre blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.,"Um, uh, uh, uh, we dont have an appointment, and, and we dont belong here, but we, were, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really dont want to look in.",May I help you?
"All right, weve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.",And thats how its done.,"Hello? This speakers not working, just pull up."
"I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So whats the plan?","Were trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.","All right, weve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
Honesty will never get us in.,"Uh, Im just gonna be honest with the guy.","I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So whats the plan?"
"All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurses office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.","Well, whats your plan?",Honesty will never get us in.
"Oh, you are killing me.","Uh, Im just gonna tell you the truth.",Who are you here to see?
What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.,"Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Cant let you in.","We dont have an appointment. We, were just fans of Mr. Lucass work, and we thought wed take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
"Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.",Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best What are you doing?,"Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I cant let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you."
"I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, its rustic, its lovely. Id take a picture, but people are chasing me. Im gonna make it. Im gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldnt dare use Aaaaaaagh!",Copy.,"Dont move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23."
Do you think theyre gonna call the police?,So did I.,"You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you."
"Oh, I think thats below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who",I dont know. Maybe theyll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.,Do you think theyre gonna call the police?
"So, what are you in for?","Uh-huh, Im normally very nice, but you shut up, too.","Hes right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police."
But why are you here?,"Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.","So, what are you in for?"
"Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.","Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.",But why are you here?
"Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.","No, youre not going anywhere, kissy face. Lets go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.","Uh, what about me?"
Are you still mad at me?,"If this doesnt get him into your bedroom, nothing will.",Keep talking.
"Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.","Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.",Are you still mad at me?
"Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think youre looking at this all wrong.","The glass is empty, Sheldon. Its completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?","Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty."
"Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.","Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.","Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think youre looking at this all wrong."
See?,That part was pretty good.,"Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser."
Ill take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.,You did flop around a lot.,See?
Thats amazing.,"You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and Im pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.",Ill take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
"And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?",I know.,Thats amazing.
"It was. And even though were not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasnt returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.",I guess this could count as an adventure.,"And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?"
"Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.","It was. And even though were not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasnt returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.",I guess this could count as an adventure.
"Well, Ill give you three guesses why Im so irritated.","Im sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?",The guy who invented it says its jif.
"I guess news travels fast. Its true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasnt included.",Something happened different from the way you wanted it.,"Well, Ill give you three guesses why Im so irritated."
Youre just saying that to make me feel better.,"Yeah, I bet you anything its just cause youre a pain in the ass.","Oh, Sheldon, Im sure its not because they dont think youre an elite scientist."
Agreed.,"Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.",Youre just saying that to make me feel better.
Sure. Its not like I was invited to Richard Feynmans house and have anything better to do.,Can you please pass the salt?,"Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings."
"I dont know the future. Do you think theres a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynmans house and everyone in it?",Is this how the rest of the nights going to be?,Sure. Its not like I was invited to Richard Feynmans house and have anything better to do.
"Then buckle up, youre in for a cranky night.","No, Sheldon.","I dont know the future. Do you think theres a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynmans house and everyone in it?"
You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.,"According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, were not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.","Then buckle up, youre in for a cranky night."
"I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as youre concerned, Im smiling. Although, I must admit, Im smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.","Well, it applies to you, too.",You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?,"Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.","Yeah, you tell him, Penny."
"You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but Ive since evolved, and now I think its dumb.",Probably not. Its an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.,Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
"Hey, look at that. Even in your example, youre all by yourself.",Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.,"You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but Ive since evolved, and now I think its dumb."
"I can just picture them all right now at Feynmans house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? Theyre missing out on hilarious jokes like that.","When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.","Hey, look at that. Even in your example, youre all by yourself."
It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldnt let me in. I hated that so much.,"And at the same time, not.","I can just picture them all right now at Feynmans house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? Theyre missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
Isnt that a little juvenile?,"You know, theres nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.",It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldnt let me in. I hated that so much.
Ill get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.,More juvenile than this?,Isnt that a little juvenile?
Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.,"Hows it going, Sheldon?","For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no."
"Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.",Can I come in?,Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
I know. This isnt the printout. This is my real face.,Amazing.,"Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket."
Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.,What are we doing? This is a fort. Lets sit on the floor.,I know. This isnt the printout. This is my real face.
"Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.",You are my brother.,"Cause thats all you need, right?"
Mm-hmm.,"Id say, Knox over Ticonderoga, cause its got the gold.","Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket."
"Wait, no. We havent picked a winner.",And McBlanket over Sumter cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten oclock. Date nights over.,Mm-hmm.
"Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesnt have a secret physics lending library.",We both know this ones gonna win.,"Wait, no. We havent picked a winner."
"Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?","Come on, Ill help you take this down.","Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesnt have a secret physics lending library."
Thats a big step.,"Well, as long as were suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.","Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?"
"Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.",Its a big fort.,Thats a big step.
"G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.",PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.,"Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover."
Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?,You got yourself a sleepover.,"G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers."
"It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know wed be in the living room?",Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?,Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
We built a fort.,Hello? What is this?,Who says this is the only one I hid?
"Well, Leonard, dont you want to see the inside of the fort?","Okay. Well, you kids have fun. Im gonna go to sleep.","Yes, they are."
"Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they cant come in.","Yeah, Im good.","Well, Leonard, dont you want to see the inside of the fort?"
"I want to say no, but its too glorious. Get in here.","Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?","Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they cant come in."
"Hey, would you like to hear some songs Ive rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?","Okay, have a seat on the floor.",Thank you.
"There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o.

"Perhaps youd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.","Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.","There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o.

Thank you. Do either of you know Beyonc? Id love her to get behind it.,"Thats pretty cool, Sheldon.","Perhaps youd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts."
Hello.,Hey.,Hey.
"All right, you cant breathe our air without an inhaler, hes allergic to Earth nuts, but Im the alien.","Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.","Well, theyre looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life."
Excellent.,"Anyway, Im among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.","All right, you cant breathe our air without an inhaler, hes allergic to Earth nuts, but Im the alien."
"Ill tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.",Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?,And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.,"Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.","Ill tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm."
"I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.",Sheldon.,I dont know. How do you want to start?
"I dont recommend it. Youll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if youre looking for Leonard, hes with Koothrappali.","Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.","I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it."
"How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.","Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.","I dont recommend it. Youll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if youre looking for Leonard, hes with Koothrappali."
"Oh, sorry. Thats not on the list.","No, no. Its about my acting career.","How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
"Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.",Well.,"Oh, sorry. Thats not on the list."
"Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.","Okay, look, heres the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, its going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.","Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy."
"Im attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.","Well, why?","Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you."
"No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and Ill start.",Youre really not gonna tell me?,"Im attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people."
"So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.",Theres my big boss man.,All by myself.
Mmm.,"Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.","So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?,"If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?",Mmm.
"All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.",No.,Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
"Well, Penny, whos smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?",Oh. Youre right. Im worried about something that hasnt even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.,"All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
"No, its the wise man. Thats why hes called the wise man. You know how I know that? Im the wise man.","Oh, I guess youre right. Maybe it is the person who asks.","Well, Penny, whos smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?"
"Uh, just out of curiosity, why didnt you ask Leonard for advice about this?",Im sorry. What was I thinking?,"No, its the wise man. Thats why hes called the wise man. You know how I know that? Im the wise man."
"Ah, its just like hes here.","Cause I already know what hell say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldnt do it.","Uh, just out of curiosity, why didnt you ask Leonard for advice about this?"
"Its the eye of the tiger, its the ear of the bat, its the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.","Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.",Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
"You didnt let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.","Hang on. Not that your song isnt terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?","Its the eye of the tiger, its the ear of the bat, its the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
Im sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.,"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?","Look, I know you guys are upset, but weve talked about it, and we think itd be beneficial for you to be part of the project."
"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?",We want you back on the project with us.,Im sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
Certainly.,"It wasnt, so are you in?",I suppose it couldnt have been easy for you to say that.
"Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.","Great. Now that were all on the same page, lets get together tonight and work on it.",Sure.
Tonight works better for me.,"Okay, I think we should do it right now.","Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj."
"Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.","So, Id like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.",Okay.
"Building on building on that, theres a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.","Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.","Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese."
"Bah, you didnt say building on. Youre out.",I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.,"Building on that, Id like to remind you, Im lactose intolerant."
"Youre out, and youre out. I win. Who wants pizza?","Yeah, youre missing the point, Sheldon.",Its not Simon Says.
"Yeah, I never cared for that. Its advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.",The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.,"Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like."
"Oh, dont be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.",Squeeze yourself.,"Yeah, I never cared for that. Its advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are."
"Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.","Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?",You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? Thats ridiculous.
We looked great.,"What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabbas head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.",Its not always.
"Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. Its amazing.",You know what? Youre right. I should have asked you.,"Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didnt even think to ask me and Leonard."
"Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.","Okay, and if were talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.","Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. Its amazing."
"I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabbas head to ice cream with Darth Vader, Im having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when Im in charge. Now, why dont you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?",Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.,"Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience."
"Leonard, whos really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?","Sheldon, youre not in charge. Raj is in charge.","I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabbas head to ice cream with Darth Vader, Im having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when Im in charge. Now, why dont you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?"
"No, the guy in charge is in ch why is everyone so bad at these?","Hes right. If you think about it, were all in charge.","Leonard, whos really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?"
Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You cant miss it.,"I, uh, huh.",Dont forget your wallet.
"If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, youre packed.","Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.","Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?"
Arent you afraid of being blinded?,Nope. Its pretty exciting.,"Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?"
"At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. Its all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.",How would I be blinded?,Arent you afraid of being blinded?
Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.,Ill take my chances.,"At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. Its all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye."
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.,With a beautiful girl on your arm.,"Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist."
All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.,"Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the cameras on, theyre both on the same network. We should be getting an image.",Ooh.
All right.,Maybe we should recalibrate it.,All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
It actually says at least?,"Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.",All right.
Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?,Yeah.,It actually says at least?
You see where Im going with this.,Sheldon.,Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
"All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But theyre still getting at least one angry letter.",Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.,You see where Im going with this.
"Initiating rotation sequence. Dont look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?",Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.,"All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But theyre still getting at least one angry letter."
"Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven. Its a good thing I didnt send that letter.",It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.,"Initiating rotation sequence. Dont look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?"
Yay.,"No red and yellow, no red and yellow.","Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?"
"We did it. Oh, if its this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.",Its green.,Yay.
"Oh, no.","Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.","We did it. Oh, if its this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it."
Wont that void the warranty?,"Oh. All right, playtimes over. Lets open this baby up.","Oh, no."
"You know what they all do, right?","Boy, oh, boy, thats a lot of pieces.",Yeah.
What about this one?,"Yes, of course.","You know what they all do, right?"
Not very.,"Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?",What about this one?
"So, can you get it working?",That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.,Not very.
I thought the zero-gravity toilet didnt work.,Im an MIT-trained engineer. Ive built components for the space station.,"So, can you get it working?"
Hello.,Hey.,"Hey, guys."
"Well, dont worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesnt originate in a Russian mans colon.",I have to return the helicopter. My father What did you do?,Hello.
You cant return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.,"No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.","Relax, itll be fine."
I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.,What?,You cant return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
"Very impressive. You know, when youre done with that, can you look at this? It doesnt make smoke anymore.","Okay, I think Ive narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.",Oh. Done and done.
"Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe its for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.",One toy at a time.,"Very impressive. You know, when youre done with that, can you look at this? It doesnt make smoke anymore."
Wrong. Obesity.,Suicide.,Whats the first one?

"Well, my mothers been there for every honour Ive won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?",Its so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.,"No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, Ill feel a disturbance in the Force."
You act like I didnt get you that mushroom log on Valentines Day.,"Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, theyre a bouquet of severed plant genitals.","Aw, its so nice. Shes gonna love it."

"What did they feed the lions, Mother?","Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.","Oh, its quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
"Listen, Leonards mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while shes here?","The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.","What did they feed the lions, Mother?"
"Of course not. I love you. Im just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.",Are you ashamed of me?,"Listen, Leonards mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while shes here?"
"Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, its so good to see you again.","Hey, look whos here.",Ugh.

"Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.","Thats so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.","Of course I did, but its a mothers job to make sure her childs self-esteem is not dependent on anyones approval."
"Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?","Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, hes terrific.",He did?
"Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.","Calm down, dear. Mary, Im curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?","You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself."
"Ooh, this is a good one.","Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.","Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius."
Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.,"Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didnt think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.","Ooh, this is a good one."
But I wasnt. Cause I didnt have any friends.,"Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.",Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.

You remember my mother.,"Sorry, I forgot.","Hello. Oh, okay."
"Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.","Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.","Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring."
"Oh, sure.",We did not. Thats not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?,"Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits."

Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?,"Yes, and well get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. Youre like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.",Did I misspeak about the ring?
"Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term youre looking for is a double mother suckler.","Yes, you are a super weaner.",Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
"Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.","Yeah, youre right. That is the term Im looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.","Well, now I have to correct you.

It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.,"Why dont we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.","Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself."
"Oh, its all right. Shell forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.",Im terribly sorry that I upset your mother.,"Youre right. Its time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess."
"Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.",I cant help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.,"Oh, its all right. Shell forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell."
"Id feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonards brother and sister are.",But look how well you turned out.,"Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat."
While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.,I suppose.,"Id feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonards brother and sister are."
"Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?",Do you suppose you wouldve flourished more in a reward-based environment?,While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.

"Ironys not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.","Really? Thats the commitment issue youre wrestling with?

We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face."
"Oh, no, not just a season. If Im in, Im in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.",Im gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.,Yeah. Im tapping out. Leonard?
"Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.",I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.,"Oh, no, not just a season. If Im in, Im in for the whole run, even if the quality declines."
"Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.","Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.","Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly."
"If that happens, dont make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.","Okay, see, thats even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.","Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary."
"No, and Im confused. Its been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out shes wrong by now.",Still havent heard from her?,Yeah. I wish Id fought harder for the rest of em.
Too slow?,"Hey, I dont think shes wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.","No, and Im confused. Its been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out shes wrong by now."

Hello.,"Uh, hello.",Thats right. Its called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two arent moving forward in your relationship.

Seriously? Airborne worms?,Fine. I want to release butterflies.,Fine. I want black-tie.
You still didnt pick a date.,Great.,Sounds perfect.
Im sorry Ive upset you. I shouldnt have asked so many questions.,"Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.","You arent scared, are you?"
"Well, look at that, even when Im causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why dont we tackle your penchant for whining and Pennys love of the ol glug-glug?","Yeah, maybe its good you got us talking about this stuff.","No, its okay."

"So youre never getting married? Its his whining, isnt it?",Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? Were committed to each other. Were happy. A ceremony isnt gonna change anything.,"Ah, well, very well. So does this mean youll finally pick a wedding date?"
Its amusing that he doesnt hear it.,"Sheldon, Im not a whiner.","So youre never getting married? Its his whining, isnt it?"
"My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.","Yeah, but well be old and gross together.","Ew, 50? Well be old and gross."

Oh.,"Okay, well, this isnt easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.",Strongly disagree. Go on.
Okay.,I hope you understand.,Oh.
"Leonard, have you gotten married yet?","Aw. Thats exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.","No. No, I want to. Look, weve put this off long enough. Lets do it."
Good. Dont do it.,No. Why?,"Leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
"Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.",Why not?,Good. Dont do it.
Amy has ended our relationship.,What happened now?,"Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep."
Is Penny crying?,She did?,Amy broke up with Sheldon.
"No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.",No.,Is Penny crying?
"Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.","Buddy, Im so sorry. Is there anything I can do?","No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering."
Whatever.,"Sheldon, uh, okay, just because youre going through this with Amy doesnt mean that all women are bad.","Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things."
Why did I just hear Amys name?,"Amy, dont be like that.",Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.

"Why? Is there someone else? Just couldnt wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?",Were not back together.,"Boy, Im glad were going out again."
And whos this guy youre taking?,"If you must know, Im going to Howard and Bernadettes to watch the wedding.","Why? Is there someone else? Just couldnt wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?"

"Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasnt I invited to this?",Im not gonna be alone. Ill be with my friends.,"Oh, youre going to a wedding alone? Thats sad."
We make everyone feel awkward. Thats our thing.,Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.,"Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasnt I invited to this?"
I didnt want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So Ill just stay out here and pretend that I dont have to go to the bathroom.,"For Gods sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?","Hey, its a true story. I dont need the third degree."
I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?,"Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.",Im on it.
"Raj, youre probably wondering why Amy and I arent showing any affection to one another.",Were good.,"No, thank you."
"Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.",Didnt even crack the top ten.,"Raj, youre probably wondering why Amy and I arent showing any affection to one another."
You hear that? Raj is devastated.,Im sure you guys will figure something out.,I said I needed time to think.
"I see whats happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadettes on Amys team, I pick Howard.","Sheldon, shh. The weddings starting.",You hear that? Raj is devastated.
"Fine, I guess Im stuck with Raj.",Im not taking sides.,"I see whats happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadettes on Amys team, I pick Howard."
"Amy, I dont understand, are we broken up or not? Its like you cant make up your mind.","No, we totally won.","Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful."
"Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs youre toting around have a sell-by date.",Its because youre not giving me any space to think.,"Amy, I dont understand, are we broken up or not? Its like you cant make up your mind."
Will someone take me home?,Amy.,"You know what, Sheldon, youve made this really easy. Youre immature, youre selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I dont need any more time to think. Were broken up."
"Hello, Mother.","No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why dont we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. Its not easy. You try it.","Oh, okay. So youre saying this is my fault?"

She broke up with me.,"Oh, whats going on?",I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless youre open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
"No, Ill be okay. But I think that Id like to send the ring back to you.","Oh, Shelly.",She broke up with me.
Its over for me. Im done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.,"Well, lets not be hasty. Are you sure its over for good?","No, Ill be okay. But I think that Id like to send the ring back to you."
Are you going to say its all part of Gods plan?,You want to tell me what happened?,Its over for me. Im done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
"Then no, thank you.",Good chance.,Are you going to say its all part of Gods plan?
Wasnt Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?,"Well, honey, dont send it back yet. Your sisters married, and Im not letting your brother give my grandmothers ring to that whore hes dating.","Then no, thank you."
"Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.","Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.","I thought I was okay, but it turns out Im not."
"Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.",Im not glowing. Im upset.,"Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing."
"Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?","Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.",Im not glowing. Im upset.

"Oh, youre right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low shed be with Leonard.",Thats ridiculous.,"Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but Im on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson."
"Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?",Im with Leonard.,"Oh, youre right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low shed be with Leonard."
Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?,Right? I cant believe Amy actually went through with it.,"Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?"
Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?,I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.,Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
"I see. Well, I think Ill be going.","Okay, look, its not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.",Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?

"Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.",Sure.,"No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?"
Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?,Really?,I dont know. Sounds pretty bad. Pennys back in her apartment all by herself.

"Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.",Of course not.,You couldnt sleep either?
"Glad you asked. As I see it, theres a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.","Please, tell me how I can fix it.",I dont know.
Im currently single.,"You cant be serious. Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, youre gonna do the same with a random guy?","Actually, I think hes onto something."
I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friends marriage.,What is happening?,Thats true. You are.
"Well, hello to you, too.","Sheldon, I dont think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.",U-u-u-uh!

"Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.",Good-bye.,"Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom Im smooshing around like pizza dough."
Hello.,"If you dont mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.","All right, look, Im sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that were going through this, but I dont know what to do."
"Oh, of course. Wouldnt want to intrude. This is yours.","Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?",Hello.
Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amys nose in it.,"Okay, when Im done with him, Im gonna need more information.","Oh, of course. Wouldnt want to intrude. This is yours."
"Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, theres a simple solution.","Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow youre gonna go to work and see this woman?",Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amys nose in it.
Bring Penny to meet Mandy.,"Wake up, wake up, wake up.","Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, theres a simple solution."
"Well, right now, Pennys imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.",What? Why?,Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
And we learned that you dont need an eyeball to do that.,"Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.","Well, right now, Pennys imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch."
Yes. And thats coming from me.,Im not being weird. Am I being weird?,"No, but now that youre being weird about it, maybe I should."
"In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see thats unlikely.","Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.",How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
"Hello. Im Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that Im holding a remote control. Thats because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. Im going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, lets not spend any more time talking about her. Were here to talk about flags. Tonights theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.","Oh, me neither, not until just now.",I never thought about it like that.
"And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I dont think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? Youd think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that its not as young as it used to be. And I dont see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.","Hey, Leonard, when youre done, we came up with a bunch more.",And your wife is worried about me?
"But enough about the Czech Republic. Lets talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didnt. And yet Romania gets dumped. Ill pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?",Im gonna kill him.,"And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I dont think you understand how being broken up works.

Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.,What is this?,"I dont know why youre so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do."
"Yeah, theres Fishermans Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. Were gonna have so much fun.",Thats so great.,Wow.
Is there a problem?,We?,"Yeah, theres Fishermans Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. Were gonna have so much fun."
"You saw through that one, did you?",How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?,"Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee."
She watched it. Im gonna get that girl back.,"I dont know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.","You saw through that one, did you?"
Would you pass the mustard?,I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.,She watched it. Im gonna get that girl back.
Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?,"Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?",Would you pass the mustard?
"Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.",Yeah.,Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
"Well, Id hardly call this kidnapping. Wheres the blindfold? Wheres the duct tape? Wheres the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say Im getting too old for this crud?","Well, you eloped and we didnt get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so theres a van downstairs and were here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.",What are you talking about?
Youre seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?,"Wow, okay.","Yeah, Penny packed you a bag."
"Oh, and how do you think youre going to get me to do that?","Oh, not just him, youre coming, too.",Youre seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
Unhand me. This is ridiculous.,"Oh, and how do you think youre going to get me to do that?","Oh, not just him, youre coming, too."
Its bad enough Im being taken against my will. I dont see why it has to be in some hippies mobile sex dungeon.,And I told you he bit me.,I told you to put tape on his mouth.
It runs on syphilis?,"Well, Sheldon, theres something about this van that youre going to find very interesting.",Its bad enough Im being taken against my will. I dont see why it has to be in some hippies mobile sex dungeon.
No.,"This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.",It runs on syphilis?
"Yeah, and talked about physics with them.",I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.,"Yeah, nothings been changed since he drove it."
"Leonard, dont be fooled. Im from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.","Fun, Ive never been there.",We are going to Me-hi-co.
"Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around cause theres a worm inside.",Whats wrong with Mexico?,"Leonard, dont be fooled. Im from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico."
Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.,"Okay, calm down. Theres a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynmans van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.","Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around cause theres a worm inside."
"Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.","Boy, that was a long night for me.","Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement."
"How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.",We dont have any of those.,"Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes."
Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?,"If there was a hidden compartment, dont you think youd be stuffed in it by now?","How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos."
You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.,You dont need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.,Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
It is extraordinary.,"Sheldon, can you believe that were driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? Its like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasnt cool.",I dont know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
"I usually dont put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynmans butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.","Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.",It is extraordinary.
What was that?,"Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.","I usually dont put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynmans butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."

Leonard?,Its the tyre.,What if its banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piatas for the rest of our lives?
I am getting too old for this crud.,What?,Leonard?
"If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someones shoulders and never coming down.",Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.,When did you learn how to change a tyre?
"Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.","Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.",Theres got to be a smarter way of removing it.
"Everybody hold on. Lets take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether were calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide its leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.","Lets see, a lever, a lever.",Exactly. Ill bet theres something around here that could be a lever.
"Ooh, the Green Lanterns ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.","No, its too broad of a beam. Youd need something more precise, like Supermans heat vision.","If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off."
"Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.","If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?","Ooh, the Green Lanterns ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
"Yes, we could use science. But its your bachelor party. Lighten up.","Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isnt a perfectly reasonable choice, but were scientists.

We do?,We have plenty of food for the animals.,What if that burning food attracts animals?
Thats not very nice.,Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.,We do?
What is that awful smell?,Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion.,Its a bachelor party. Lighten up.
What an innovative solution. Perhaps I dont give your MIT education enough credit.,Its burning salsa. Im hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.,What is that awful smell?
"All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.",Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction.,"Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters."
We blew up Feynmans van.,"If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amys ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.",Thank you.
"What a wonderful day, thank you.",I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.,My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
"Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? Its like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.","Oh, were glad you had fun.","What a wonderful day, thank you."
"Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here Im 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?",I still dont understand why you bought that pill caddie. Youre a young man.,"Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? Its like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven."
Whats wrong with your closet?,"Its just where I need them. You know, she doesnt have a lot of closet space.","Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here Im 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?"

"No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I mightve said yes.","Come on, buddy.",So thats all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
"You know what they dont sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.","Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.","No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I mightve said yes."
Thank you for letting me come speak with you.,"You know what they dont sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.","Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this."
"As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, Im turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.",Of course.,Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
"I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonards mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.",Aw.

"Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonards moving in with Penny. Its difficult not to feel abandoned.",How can I help you?,"Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting."
Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratts all the rage right now. I wonder how hed feel about taking the smaller bedroom.,"Well, why dont you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.","Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonards moving in with Penny. Its difficult not to feel abandoned."

It says here youre a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?,Sure.,I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.

"I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?","In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?",Looks like argons not the only one with an attitude problem.
"Youre healthy. You have a job in the sciences. Ive got to say, if this credit report comes back good, youre the frontrunner.","I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?","In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?"
"But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.","Im not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.","Youre healthy. You have a job in the sciences. Ive got to say, if this credit report comes back good, youre the frontrunner."
"I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. Id say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?",Im sure youll find somebody else.,"But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out.

"No, just because Im living my life like it was 12 years ago doesnt mean Im delusional. And since it is 2003, I dont know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.","Hang on. Wait, you actually think its 2003?","You heard him, no."
"Hello, 2003.","Hey, I know Sheldons quirky, but hes also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.","Im sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life."
"In my present, its in the future. In your present, its been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.","Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?","Hello, 2003."

"No, I do. Eventually youll want more space, and youll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, itll only be a couple of times a month, and then itll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz.

Or Amys wedding, where shes marrying someone better than me.","Okay, you dont know whats gonna happen.","How can you say that? Amys gone, and you two are married now, so its only a matter of time before youre gone, too."

Thats ridiculous.,"Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.","If youre cranky and retaining water, I have a theory."
"True, but Pennys married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.","Why? You never thought youd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe theres someone else out there for you.",Thats ridiculous.
"Theres that prostate doctor, but Im still mad at her. Oh, theres a woman.

It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.,Howd that go?,Im doing all right. I tried fencing today.
"Okay. But dont get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, hes a dead man.","Well, actually, he, he already did.",It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
"Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.",I said no.,"Okay. But dont get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, hes a dead man."
Ive been told its a good way to move on.,I didnt know you were interested in dating.,"Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no."
Thanks. And I taste good too.,"Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, its nice to see you. You look good.",Ive been told its a good way to move on.
"Leonard, Ive got terrible news.",Whats up?,Howie?
"Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. Youre face is pleasingly symmetrical.",Whats going on?,"Leonard, Ive got terrible news."
A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.,Just tell me.,"Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. Youre face is pleasingly symmetrical."
That kind of stinks? Why arent you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.,"Oh, well, that kind of stinks.",A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
Perform the experiment immediately.,What are we going to do?,That kind of stinks? Why arent you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.,"Id love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipments on back order for a month.",Perform the experiment immediately.
Thank you. Arent you sweet.,That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.,A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
Did you know that I almost didnt wear this shirt today?,Lets go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.,Thank you. Arent you sweet.
But you wont need much for that.,"Sowwy, theres a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.","Hey, Barry, were in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
Not a chance.,Yes.,"Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?"
"He said be honest, so I was honest. Didnt your mother tell you? Its the best policy. So, what do you say?",What are you doing?,Not a chance.
He couldve softened the blow.,Hell no.,"He said be honest, so I was honest. Didnt your mother tell you? Its the best policy. So, what do you say?"
"Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.","Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.",Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
Where does he work?,Who is he?,"If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you dont ask too many questions."
How many questions are too many questions?,How does he get the helium?,Where does he work?
Four questions. There answers four.,Maybe hes not for you.,How many questions are too many questions?
Whats he say?,"Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.",First time it happens I will let you know.
"Really? You know I dont like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralphs at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?",Hes got what we need and can meet us tonight.,Whats he say?
Thats right. And what did he do?,The man restocking the cereal shelves.,"Really? You know I dont like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralphs at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?"
Its like it was yesterday.,He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.,Thats right. And what did he do?
Of course I do. I dont want that Swedish team scooping us.,Do you want liquid helium or not?,Its like it was yesterday.
"Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.",Then Im going to tell him were in.,Of course I do. I dont want that Swedish team scooping us.
Was she helping him with his research?,"Were just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so were going to spend it on the helium we need. Its not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.","Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical."
"Well, but where does he get the helium?","Sure. So, are we doing this?",Was she helping him with his research?
"Uh, but this is violating university code.",Remember? Dont ask too many questions?,"Well, but where does he get the helium?"
"Huh. All right, do it. Tell him were in.","A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.","Uh, but this is violating university code."
I cant find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?,Done.,"Huh. All right, do it. Tell him were in."
Arent you just made of sugar.,"Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.",I cant find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
"Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.",That must be him.,"Hang on, Im trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
Im Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.,"Uh, Im Leonard. This is my friend",Whats up?
"Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that youre not gonna take the money and drive away?","Uh, yeah, uh, right here.",Great. You got the cash?
Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.,"What ya doing, Skippy?","Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that youre not gonna take the money and drive away?"
Guess Im not the only one who watches 70s television crime dramas.,"Oh, how do I know youre not gonna drive away without paying me?",Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
"Well, he is. Im a wedding planner who cant find love himself. Its ironic, but the point is we cant trust you. Youre a sketchy character in a parking garage.","Look, you can trust us. Were respected scientists.",Guess Im not the only one who watches 70s television crime dramas.
"Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, wont it?","Yeah, well, from my perspective, thats how you two appear to me.","Well, he is. Im a wedding planner who cant find love himself. Its ironic, but the point is we cant trust you. Youre a sketchy character in a parking garage."
"Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, youre only limited by your imagination.","Ah, no money, no helium. Seems were at a, uh, stalemate.",My friend does make a decent point about the money. I dont feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
"Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.","Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.",I dont think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
"Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or Ill turn you in to the authorities.","Hmm, I dont follow.","Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
"Yeah, exactly. See, youre getting it.",Is that a threat?,"Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or Ill turn you in to the authorities."
Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where Ive won the battle but lost the war?,"Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, Ill report you, then Ill pound your asses into the ground.","Yeah, exactly. See, youre getting it."
I told you we shouldnt go shopping at night.,"Afraid so, Skippy.",Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where Ive won the battle but lost the war?
Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.,Really? Whats the hypothesis?,"No, no, no. Wait, dont go. Just let me explain. Were physicists, and were trying to prove a hypothesis that weve been working on for over a year."
"And Im sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who cant find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.","Okay, but now theres this Swedish team that read our paper and theyre trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.","Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on."
"Did you hear that, Leonard? Theres plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?","Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, theres, uh, plenty we could do about it.",Its actually pretty common in our field. Theres not much you can do about it.
"Right this way, Uncle Harvey.",You may want to leave the room.,"Look, its Stuart."
Im trying not to attract attention.,Will you stop with that already?,"Right this way, Uncle Harvey."
She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?,And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didnt do that?,Im trying not to attract attention.
"Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.",Lets just start the experiment.,She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
"Well, you cant be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I dont have an Uncle Harvey?",Were not getting caught.,"Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."
Uh-oh.,"The dealer doesnt care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.","Well, you cant be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I dont have an Uncle Harvey?"
"Well, did you see this sticker?",What?,Uh-oh.
"Its partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.",What is it?,"Well, did you see this sticker?"
"Yeah, but what if its Property of U.S. Government? Theres a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, were accessories to a federal crime.",Its probably USC or UCLA.,"Its partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U."
"Thats true. Theres the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.",Lets not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.,"Yeah, but what if its Property of U.S. Government? Theres a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, were accessories to a federal crime."
"Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and well be on our way.","Yeah, well, normally I wouldnt, but my daughters having a sleepover, and theres only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.",Thank you for coming back.
"He has glasses and Im a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.","No, nothing. We just changed our mind.","Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?"
Youre taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.,But you aint getting your money back.,Thank you.
I dont understand.,"No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.",You know what? Its fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
"Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. Thats all Ive got on me.",He wants more money.,I dont understand.
"Finally, something breaks our way.",Thats exactly how much it is.,"Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. Thats all Ive got on me."
"Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we wont get gang-noogied in prison.",Damn it.,Three.
"It scared me straight, Leonard.",Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie youve seen?,"Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we wont get gang-noogied in prison."
Thats preposterous.,But you have to add my name to your paper.,"Thank you, Barry."
I dont like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.,Take your time. Ill walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.,Can you give us a minute?
How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?,It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.,I promise this is the last time.
"Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.","They shouldve used among, right?",How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
Absolutely. But dont be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.,"All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?","Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic."
Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoys son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. Its about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.,"You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.",Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
"Well, theyre looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought Id be good for it.",Why is he writing to you?,Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoys son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. Its about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
"Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?","Oh. Hey, high five.","Well, theyre looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought Id be good for it."
"This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. Im sure if theres nudity, it will be tasteful.",Yes. Dont take your shirt off just because the director said so.,"Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?"
"Hello, Amy. Its Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that were broken up, but Im leaving this message because I thought perhaps youd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, Im going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like youre hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that Im no longer in your life.",Never mind.,Is it about how I cant have new wallpaper cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
Hello.,And Im laughing like I did the first time I heard it.,Im the one who thought of Spockumentary.
"Oh, its nice to meet you. I admire your fathers work very much. Its not every day I get to meet someone whose lifes journey began in my heros scrotum.",Nice to meet you.,"Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy."
All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.,"All right, were just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the cameras not here.",Great. Im gonna go pick out paint samples.
"Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.",Lets start with your name and occupation.,And what are you getting him back for?
"The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brothers sphincter-based cuisine.",And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?,"Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech."
"I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, Im not. Youre moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.",What was it about Spock that appealed to you?,"The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brothers sphincter-based cuisine."
I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. Thats her over there.,Do you have any Spock collectibles?,"Yeah, you probably had it coming."
Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.,Can we see the napkin?,"Hi. Look at that. Im in a movie, my shirt stayed on."
When there was no more room in the floor safe.,When did we get a wall safe?,Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
When we got the security camera.,When did we get a floor safe?,When there was no more room in the floor safe.
"Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.",Theres a security camera?,When we got the security camera.
Yeah. You dont have to tell me.,"Oh, my God. Weve done things on that couch.","Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012."
Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoys DNA.,When is your visa up?,"Well, its easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
"No offence, but this is pure 100 Nimoy. Because of your mother, youre only 50. Which isnt bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.","Um, doesnt Adam count as Leonard Nimoys DNA?",Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoys DNA.
Wouldnt you like to know?,"Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?","No offence, but this is pure 100 Nimoy. Because of your mother, youre only 50. Which isnt bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
"All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.",I would.,Wouldnt you like to know?
"Yeah. My 1 18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.",You have a will?,"All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will."
Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.,"Oh, whats that ring box?",Wil wont.
"No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmothers finger and stole it.",You bought her a ring?,What?
"No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.","Sheldon, thats awful.","No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmothers finger and stole it."
No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.,"Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?","No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana."
"No, not at all. No, Im fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.","Oh, man, Im sorry, that must have been devastating for you.",No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
"Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.",Did you find that helpful?,I know. It just
"Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.",What about from when you were a kid?,I knew I could smell em.
"Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.",Did it work?,"Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch."
"Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which Ive spent a lifetime mastering.",That must have been very upsetting for you.,"Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click."
Excuse me?,Oh pfft.,"Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which Ive spent a lifetime mastering."
No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?,Im sorry. Im not here.,Excuse me?
"Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.","Im just saying, you pretend you dont, but you have feelings just like everybody else.",Just like you.
"Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that Ive put this Amy nonsense behind me.","Sweetie, youre yelling.","Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time."
Hello.,Yeah.,I know. I also cant believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?,"Hey, buddy. How you doing?",Hello.
Do you think theyre going to put my outburst in the documentary?,Yeah.,Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
"Well, theres no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor hakiv naish Du stau.",Definitely.,"Oh, yeah."
"Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isnt accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.",Nirsh.,Are you telling the truth?
"Im going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.",What are you gonna do?,"Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isnt accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action."
"Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?",Because she feels. I dont. All I know is logic.,Dr. Dana feels he isnt that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
Those are very wise words.,"Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.","Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off.

"Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.","Oh, I dont want credit for that.","Ah, well, whats this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal."
"Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.",Youre in a good mood.,"Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning."
"I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.",What brought this on?,Oh. Good for you.
"No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.",And you dont want to make the same mistake with the next woman.,"I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
On oatmeal day?,"Hey, I made French toast sticks.","No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again."
"Ooh, thats a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. Youre married, it doesnt matter what you look like.","Ah, I also made oatmeal.",On oatmeal day?
"Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.",Dont take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.,"Ooh, thats a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. Youre married, it doesnt matter what you look like."
"Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that Im looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.",So whats up?,No problem.
"Oh, no, its all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.",You sure youre up for that? She did hurt you.,"Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that Im looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again."
Gentlemen.,"Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.",Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? Youre crazy.

"All right, fine, she doesnt need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.",Isnt that a little unreasonable?,"All Im looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view.

Found one.,"Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.","Yep, Im on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella."
"But, look, an optical transient.","No, you didnt. There are millions of data points there.",Found one.
"It wasnt difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when theyre twin primes, theyre pink and smell like gasoline?","Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?","But, look, an optical transient."
"Oh. I guess Im a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.",No.,"It wasnt difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when theyre twin primes, theyre pink and smell like gasoline?"

It is kind of cute.,You dream different than me.,I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didnt do Uranus any favours.,"Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.",It is kind of cute.
Thats a great idea. Ive got it. Well call it Cooper.,"So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.","Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!"

"All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.",We havent settled on anything yet.,I havent settled on anything yet.
"Its perfect. It appears romantic, but its really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentines Day forever.",That is a great idea.,You know whatd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
"I like it. Yeah, well take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.","So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?","Its perfect. It appears romantic, but its really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentines Day forever."

"I had a hundred and one fever. If thats not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?","Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.","You know how, when youre sick, youre allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other peoples feelings dont matter?"

If thats not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?"

"Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebees.","Well, maybe I dont like you either.",And heres some more honesty. I dont like you very much.
"But why? Other than you two fighting, were having such a good time.",I think I should leave.,"Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebees."
Yes.,You have an engagement ring?,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. Ill catch up with you."

"Oh, I dont think I could do that.","Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?","Well, thank goodness for that."
"Im gonna opt out of that one, too.","Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.","Oh, I dont think I could do that."
"All right, all right, look, l, lets all, lets remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that youve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?","Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I dont need your hand-me-downs.","Im gonna opt out of that one, too."
Thank you. Im gonna go next door and play with Leonard.,Dont speak to him like hes a child.,You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.
Leonard and Penny.,"Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.",Did it?
No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.,Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?,Come in.
"Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So heres the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?",Uh-oh.,No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
"No, I wouldnt.",Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.,"Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I dont want to see that happen again."
Hello.,Just get in here.,"No, I wouldnt."
"Meemaw, look, Im sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.",Go ahead.,Hello.
"Oh, great, now youre gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.","Oh, Sheldon, thank you.","Meemaw, look, Im sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you."
"Yeah, well, that is exactly what Ive been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.",I did.,"Oh, great, now youre gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
Well,I think what Sheldon means to say is weve both grown together. Isnt that right?,"He never disappoints, does he?"
Yes.,Say yes.,Well
Thank you.,"Fine. If you feel so strongly, I wont stand in your way.",Yes.
"I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.",I suppose.,"So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?"

Cause youre not getting anything else."
"You know what, thats not a flag question. Next caller.","I, I think it starts with good communication.","Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?"
"Yeah, you know whats not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, were rooting for you.",You really think so?,"Rajesh, its perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone."
"I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.","No, Sheldons right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.",Your friend is hurting.

Food fight. Ill keep thinking.
"And actually, it was three different men.","Well, I, I wouldnt say right away.","But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didnt you start dating someone right away?"

The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.","Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I dont know if I can do that again.","Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."

It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isnt good for us.","No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, youre not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.",Im sorry for bothering you. Ill hang up now.

I guess well call this a draw.,Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?,"Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"

"Oh, but then wed have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.

This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?,Its true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.,"I dont know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them."
Thats some smart talk from a guy who cant even keep his face in focus. Wheres the bathroom?,The same reason we dont do a lot of fun stuff. You.,This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?

"You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. Theres people cooking in it.",I really do.,You think so?
"Oh, wait, I found something.",Its a good sign.,Im not finding anything either.
"This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.",Damn. What is it?,"Oh, wait, I found something."
"All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.",Can you focus on what were talking about?,"This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?,"Even drunk, hes still smarter than all of us.","All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible."
"Nah, shes a good kid.",Id enjoy that.,And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
Of course hes right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. Thats why Im confident youre gonna be the best dad you can be.,Maybe youre right.,"Im telling you, you got this."
"Youre welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.","Thank you, Sheldon.",Of course hes right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. Thats why Im confident youre gonna be the best dad you can be.
"Wonderful. Im being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.",Hi. How are you doing?,Thank you.
"A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.","So, you gonna get up there later?",Sure.
"Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.",Push it real good.,"I appreciate this, but you really"
Youre kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone elses bedroom?,"Id like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie.  Havin my baby, what a lovely way of sayin how much you love me. Havin my baby, what a lovely way of sayin what youre thinkin of me.","Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring."
Will you guys keep it down?,I think wed make amazing parents.,"Babies? Well, Im not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?"
What is it?,Way to narrow it down to everything.,"So Sheldon, theres something Ive been wanting to talk about but I know its kind of a touchy subject."
"Oh, I suppose thats a discussion we could have.","Well, your birthdays coming up, and youve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.",What is it?
Surprise.,Ill check his room.,Sheldon?
"Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.","Oh, my God.",Surprise.
"Please, look at this porcelain skin. Im like a human sink.","Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?",Im sorry I brought it up.
"Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year wed have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didnt like me.",Can you please just tell me why?,One day. Right.
"Oh, that part wasnt so bad. I didnt like them, either. But then Id inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sisters friends.",Im sorry.,"Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year wed have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didnt like me."
"When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.","Oh, poor thing.","Oh, that part wasnt so bad. I didnt like them, either. But then Id inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sisters friends."
"I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?",You realize none of those things would happen now?,"When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window."
"Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.",Yeah.,"And we live here, so we have no choice."
"Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.","Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?","Oh, yeah. Wont take the bus. He wont pack his own lunch. Wont let you spend the night on his couch."
I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.,"All right, what about music?","Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car."
"Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if theres writing on it, make sure its not all caps. I dont need my dessert yelling at me.",What kind of cake do you like?,No music it is.
Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?,Whats an Affleck?,"Yeah, of course."
But whos gonna tell them theyre doing it wrong?,"Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.",Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
Oh. Thank you.,"Well, Im, Im sure theyll ask you to give a speech, and thats when you just tear em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.",But whos gonna tell them theyre doing it wrong?
But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because thats the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.,"Maybe later Ill, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.",Oh. Thank you.
I am. Oh. Wait.,Oh. Penny says everyones there. Are you ready?,"And I never did thank you for that, dear."
"No, I just, I got a little light-headed.",Are you all right?,I am. Oh. Wait.
"No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.","Oh, do you need a minute?","No, I just, I got a little light-headed."
"Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.","Come on, Sheldon, say something.",Speech! Speech!
Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.,"Happy birthday, Sherman.",Batman finally came to your party.
How do you know Im not using the facilities?,"Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?","Again, no"
"I dont know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.","Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though Ive clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, whats going on?",How do you know Im not using the facilities?
I know that you worked hard to put this together. Im sorry Im ruining it.,"I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. Itll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.","I dont know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much."
I dont think I can go back out there.,"Oh, pl, youre not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.",I know that you worked hard to put this together. Im sorry Im ruining it.
"Based on this pep talk, Id say youre still doing it.","Thats fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.",I dont think I can go back out there.
"Well, everyone will think Im weird.","My point is, there was a time I never wouldve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, Im happy to do it with you.","Based on this pep talk, Id say youre still doing it."
"Hello, everyone. I, Id like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasnt put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.",What are you wooking at me for? Im a saint. But a sinner in the sack.,"Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think hes a little embarrassed, so lets all be extra nice, okay?"
"Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Lets do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.","If I may, I, Id like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know its customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.","Hello, everyone. I, Id like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasnt put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand."
"Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.","Sheldon, I dont think everyone","Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Lets do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me."
"Little generic. Keep thinking. Well circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.","Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, weve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.","Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz."
"Thats how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why hes famous and youre not.","Sheldon, I know that weve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.","Little generic. Keep thinking. Well circle back. Wil Wheaton, go."
And it was Sheldon Cooper who said lets speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.,"And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.","Seriously, Barry, stop."
"Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.","Uh, in the past, I wouldve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But Im not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and its just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.",And it was Sheldon Cooper who said lets speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
"Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.","I cant think of anything to say that hasnt already been said, so, heres to you, Sheldon.","Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, Im also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs"
Thank you.,"Sheldon, weve been together so long, its hard to remember a time you werent in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. Youre more than just my roommate, youre my brother.",What? You gotta be kidding me?
"Thank you. That, that was wonderful.","Happy birthday, buddy.",Thank you.
Professor Hawking.,"Hello, Sheldon.",Weve got someone who couldnt be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
Thank you so much. I cant believe youre,Happy birthday to you.,Professor Hawking.
"Oh, youre singing. Well, Im sorry.",Happy birthday to you.,Thank you so much. I cant believe youre
"You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now theyre just extremely irritating.","Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didnt think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.","I was crushing it, but all right."
Ive never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.,"Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?","Happy birthday to you,"
"Yeah, well, youre an engineer. End of joke, burn.",Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?,Ive never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
Thats great.,"So, Ive reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like weve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.","Well, hes a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending."
Get a load of this guy.,"Thats nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.","Yeah, we did our own search."
Thats outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?,Seventy-five percent?,Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75 of the patent.
I know when Im beat.,Its university policy.,Thats outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
"Well, thats not fair. We should all get plaques.","Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.","Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?"
Couple of questions about the plaque.,Thank you for your time.,"Come on, lets go."
"Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.","We cant. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.","Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"
"To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.","Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.","Either way, I get nothing."
Im fine with that.,"Of course, we can split any profits three ways.",I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
"It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.","Okay, great.",Im fine with that.
But which one of us should be the party who,"Sure, we could write something up.","It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order."
So stipulated.,"You can do it, Sheldon.",But which one of us should be the party who
"Ill say it looks good. Its in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.",This contract looks good to me.,Will do.
You bet I did.,"Sheldon, did you draft the contract?","Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so were forming a partnership to split anything we make equally."
Excuse me. Ive been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didnt need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Dont need one now.,"So, youre just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?",Ooh. Youre gonna make out so hard tonight.
"Hey, Leonard.",Excuse us.,Sure.
"If she doesnt think that we should apply for this patent, shes being patently absurd.",What?,"Hey, Leonard."
"Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.",Good one.,"If she doesnt think that we should apply for this patent, shes being patently absurd."
I wonder what theyre talking about.,I hope everythings okay.,Theyve been out there a while.
Hello.,Hey.,"If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.,"Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and Im a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.",You guys all right?
"Well, I believe Im treating you generously. Thats why Ive stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.","Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. Its, its with how you treat me.",Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
"No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.",Are you saying that his contributions arent as valuable as yours?,"Well, I believe Im treating you generously. Thats why Ive stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own."
"Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.",How would you enforce it?,No. What Im saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he cant make fun of Howard.
"Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadows on my spot.",And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
"Ill add it right now. Oh, baby, its addendum time.",Im on board.,"Howard, what do you think?"
"The, the revisions I made start on page four.",Call you right back.,I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?
Do you still like cilantro?,"Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.","Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad."
Youre tying my hands here.,Yeah.,Do you still like cilantro?
"Oh, Ive always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive Ive been of your contributions.","Thats very generous, Sheldon.",That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.,I appreciate that.,"Oh, Ive always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive Ive been of your contributions."
What? I didnt sign it yet.,Sheldon.,And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
"Uh, can you repeat that? Youre breaking up.",I didnt understand your e-mail.,"As a matter of fact, I do. Im gonna comfort her, because Im a caring and decent friend whos happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."
"Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.",I didnt understand your e-mail.,"Uh, can you repeat that? Youre breaking up."
"So, is that a yes?","Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?","Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working."
"Oh, but I like this computer.","Sheldon, why dont you get a new computer? You know that ones out-of-date.","So, is that a yes?"
"Im sorry, I didnt get that.","The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.","Oh, but I like this computer."
The sound is cutting out. I cant read that. The video is failing.,"The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.","Im sorry, I didnt get that."
What?,Get a new computer.,The sound is cutting out. I cant read that. The video is failing.
What?  Hello?,Get a new computer.,What?

"Well, isnt Man-Man just Man?",But Batman is a man. Youre talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. Thats just Man-Man.,But wouldnt Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
"Oh, I havent asked it yet.",So does that answer your question?,"No, if a man dresses as a bat, thats Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, thats Batman-Man."
"What, why did you get a party sub?","Seriously, that guys dating two women?","I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up."
"Well, were only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies its a party.","People are coming over, it looked fun.","What, why did you get a party sub?"

"Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.",Cause were not in it for the stuff. Were in it for the groupies.,How come scientists dont win free stuff like salespeople do?
"I also say dont contradict me in front of my friends, but that you dont remember.",But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.,"Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."

Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.,You dont know his girlfriend very well.,"Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that."

"What? But hes a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. Hes basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.","No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.","Mary, Im sorry youre in the middle of this."
"Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?",Are you saying that my dads not good enough for your mom?,"What? But hes a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. Hes basically Leonard with a bigger prostate."

I never realized this building was classified.,"You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, Ill have the jury eating out of my hand.","Oh, thats so beautiful."
"The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps thats a good thing.",Wish we werent so far from my parking space.,Maybe thats because its classified.
Why? It clearly doesnt work.,Id like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.,"The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps thats a good thing."
Impressive.,No way.,"Howard Wolowitz, access granted."
It knows.,Access denied.,I didnt even have to take my glasses off
"Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the days thoughts.","Sure, Im still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.",Its pretty late. You think Ive got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
"Its called sleep and its my bedtime. Nighty-night, yall.",What?,"Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the days thoughts."
"I know, I was there.",We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.,"Hey, hey, hey, youre not going anywhere."
How late?,"Well, wake up, were gonna put in a lot of late nights.","I know, I was there."
One oclock? Im not a raccoon.,"Well, I dont know, midnight, one.",How late?
What? You have some coffee.,"If youre tired, have some coffee.",One oclock? Im not a raccoon.
And look how irritable its making you!,I am having coffee.,What? You have some coffee.
Fine.  I dont think I can go much longer.,"Guys, were not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try",And look how irritable its making you!
I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.,"Its been three and a half minutes, wake up.",Fine.  I dont think I can go much longer.
"Ow, it does hurt.","Oh, that is so nice.","Well, we didnt see you last night, were not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together."
"Oh, that was never happening.","Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I dont think thats happening.","So, what are you guys gonna do today?"
I wont be there.,"Oh, Ill have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I dont understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?",You dont think youll be bored?
"Huh, what?","Psst, hey, kid.","You didnt think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am."
"Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.",You look tired. Why dont you have an energy drink? Everyones doing it.,"Huh, what?"
"I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milks delicious watery cousin.","Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.","Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?,"All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.","I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milks delicious watery cousin."
I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.,You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.,Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
"The first ones free? Flash, how do you stay in business?",Here. Its on the house.,I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
"Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, lets science the faeces out of this. Thats The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.","Oh, its complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine",Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
"Oh, Im fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, were not fat enough, or wearing diapers.",Are you okay?,"Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, lets science the faeces out of this.

My head hurts and Im more tired than ever.,"According to the worlds worst cuckoo clock, its two.",Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
"No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.",Why dont you just go home?,My head hurts and Im more tired than ever.
I want another one.,What?,"No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no."
Thats a craving. Thats a sign of chemical dependency.,So?,I want another one.
"No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just cant stop.",You only had one.,Thats a craving. Thats a sign of chemical dependency.
"You want to bet? Oh, great, now Im addicted to gambling.",You cant develop a problem that fast.,"No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just cant stop."
"Im sorry. Yes, of course.","Thats not helpful. Its fun to think about, but its not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We cant do this without you. Can you please pull it together?","Well, this probably wont work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?"
"Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.",Thank you.,"Im sorry. Yes, of course."
You guys stink.,No worries.,"Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
"Uh, youre really going to have caffeine in front of me when Im trying to get my life back on track?",Im gonna get some coffee. You want some?,"Wow, you popular girls are mean."
I do.,"Uh, okay, lets pretend you do have a problem.","Uh, youre really going to have caffeine in front of me when Im trying to get my life back on track?"
"Yeah, but I do.",You dont.,I do.
With what?,"No, you dont. But lets say you do. And dont say you do, because you dont. Now, wouldnt you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?","Yeah, but I do."
I thought I didnt have a problem.,Your problem.,With what?
"Leonard, can I ask you a question?","Happy and well-fed. You see, thats what Im taking from that story.","Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
"Howard, can I ask you a question?",Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
"All right, Ill just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldnt find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum",No.,"Howard, can I ask you a question?"
You dont shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.,"Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, dont have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove em wherever you want, I dont care.","All right, Ill just toss this out to the room.

I cant.,Right. Listen to me. We cant do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.,You dont shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
"No, I cant figure out the math. Ive been racking my brain for days, and Ive got nothing.","Yes, you can.",I cant.
I cant do it. Im not as smart as I think I am. Im so sorry. This is all my fault.,Seriously?,"No, I cant figure out the math. Ive been racking my brain for days, and Ive got nothing."
But what if we cant?,"Its okay, well figure something out.",I cant do it. Im not as smart as I think I am. Im so sorry. This is all my fault.
"He said start with it, not end with it.","Right. Sorry, sir.","Well, you could try starting with sir."
The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.,Weve hit a bit of a snag. Were already behind schedule.,Hmm?
"We, we really appreciate it.","Yes, thank you so much.","Thanks for understanding, sir."
Why are you all smiling like crazy people?,"Mm-hmm. For two of us, its in the right direction.","Oh, my, this is a big step."
Cohabitation with my girlfriend? Thats a great deal to process.,Why are you all smiling like crazy people?,"Mm-hmm. For two of us, its in the right direction."
I dont know. What if living together kills the romance?,What do you think?,"Yeah, and well be right across the hall."
"Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, shes never even seen me unshaven.","Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.",I dont know. What if living together kills the romance?
Dont try luring me in with sexy talk.,"Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isnt it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?",You just shaved yesterday. Youre good for three months.
"If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, thats how you do it.","Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.",Dont try luring me in with sexy talk.
"Not yet. How will I learn if Im comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because Im in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.","So, is that a yes?",Dont be proud of that.
"Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.","Well, where would you go?","Not yet. How will I learn if Im comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because Im in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment."
"Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if Id need to knock every time I came over here.","Wait. Why dont you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?","And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
"Historically, I dont do well with change.",Thats a good question. Maybe just dont come over.,"Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if Id need to knock every time I came over here."
"Youre darn right, you wouldnt. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.","Okay, it wont be that bad. We wouldnt even sit in your spot while youre gone.","Historically, I dont do well with change."
Very well. Im on board.,"Sheldon, what do you think?",Just nod and smile. Hes almost gone.
Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.,Seriously?,Very well. Im on board.
"Well, now, dont be surprised if, like Star Trek, its cancelled in three.",Oh. This is so exciting.,Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
Oh. Thank you.,"You know, Im very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.","Okay, well, thats a problem."
"Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, itd be such a party, wed never get anything done.",Mm.,Oh. Thank you.
"Well, youve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?","That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?","Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys.

"You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.","Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.","Well, youve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?"
How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?,"He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.","Youre gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each others personal space."
You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.,I dont know. I didnt count.,How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
"Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.","Thats me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?",You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
Okay. Talk.,"Well, if youre nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.","Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain."
"Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.","Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.",Okay. Talk.
Youre really okay with that?,"Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why dont we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once were more settled in, we can revisit it.","Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it."
"This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didnt get you all worked up, Id kiss you right now.","Ive never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.",Youre really okay with that?
I know. They probably shouldnt sell those to children.,Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.,"This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didnt get you all worked up, Id kiss you right now."
Enjoy having the place to yourselves.,Thank you.,"Well, heres your key."
Its Pennys bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.,You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.,Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
I guess this is it.,Shall we?,"Now, now, theres no need to make this emotional."
"You, too. Oh, dont forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.",You guys have fun.,I guess this is it.
"Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.","Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.","You, too. Oh, dont forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
"Leonard, please, let me go.","Im on it. 15 years from now, well make guacamole together.","Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
Oh. Bye.,"Come on, Sheldon.","Leonard, please, let me go."
I guess the experiment begins.,"Well, thats it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.",Good night.
Which side of the bed would you prefer?,Yeah.,"Wa-how, we did it."
"No, no, were living together now, everythings equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.",Doesnt matter to me. Your choice.,Which side of the bed would you prefer?
"Well, clearly, its not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.","Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.","No, no, were living together now, everythings equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose."
"Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?","Well, Im not refusing. Im just trying to be considerate.","Well, clearly, its not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
"Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.","Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?","Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
"No, but Im also closer to the entrance in case of attack.",Great. Thats your side.,"Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
"Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?","Okay, Ill take that side.","No, but Im also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
"Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.",Rising rapidly.,"Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
I suppose that works.,Okay. What if we do this?,"Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
Although now Im kind of worried someones hiding behind those drapes.,Great.,I suppose that works.
Be grateful Im still in the room.,"But you didnt listen, and presto change-o, my babys inside you. Ta-da.",Everyone said I could do better.
"Oh, Im just happy I dont know what this memory foam remembers.",Comfy?,Be grateful Im still in the room.
"Well, its funny you should ask, because I was wondering how youd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.","Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.","Oh, Im just happy I dont know what this memory foam remembers."
"Okay, well, I am sorry. Im just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, Im surprised there arent iguanas lying on it.","Sheldon, Ive made more than enough accommodations for you. Were both grown adults, weve been far more intimate than this. If you dont want to snuggle, fine, but were not building a pillow wall.","Well, its funny you should ask, because I was wondering how youd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
"No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, youll never learn.",Call you back.,Hello?
What are you doing down there?,"Oh, oh, oh.","I changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
Who are you calling? Aaargh!,Hang on.,What are you doing down there?
"Good morning. See? I didnt knock, but its fine. I didnt knock, but its fine. I didnt knock, but its fine. So, how is everyone?",Yeah.,"If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
Really? I slept great.,Miserable and exhausted.,"Good morning. See? I didnt knock, but its fine. I didnt knock, but its fine. I didnt knock, but its fine. So, how is everyone?"
How? You had the whole floor to yourself.,"Well, I didnt, and its your fault.",Really? I slept great.
"Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?","Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.",How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
"Wow. I anticipated wed have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.",The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.,"Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.,"Im sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?","Wow. I anticipated wed have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
How dare you?,"What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldnt know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you dont even get that joke, cause you dont even work with confounding variables.",Oh.
"Whoa, whoa! Now youre making fun of my bona fides?","Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.",How dare you?
"Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.",Damn.,Do it.
"For science, maybe you should.","Well, for science, maybe I will.","Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
Fine.,Fine.,"For science, maybe you should."
Great.,Good.,Fine.
Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?,Do you want to go to our place and make out?,Great.
Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?,Ill give you a hint. Were watching Daredevil.,"Okay, Im confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?"
I can if youd just roll over and accept your fate.,"I told you, you cant regulate every aspect of our lives.",Dont.
"Oh, look whos in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.",Shes right. Thats reasonable.,"Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and Im willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
Well Im open to that.,"When you live with someone, theres gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.","Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
I think we should see other people.,"Sheldon, what do you say to that?","Okay. Well, for starters, theres nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
"Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.",What?,I think we should see other people.
"Dont blame me. Blame your pal, biology. Hes the pervert pulling the strings here.",We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?,"Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
"You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.",You know whats weird? How turned on you are right now.,Youre so weird.
Yes.,Just as challenging?,"You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging."
Yes.,As you?,Yes.
"When were sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto",Just as challenging as you?,Yes.
Shes always complaining about people at work.,"Leonard breathes on me, too. Its not a big deal.","When were sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto"
"Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like Im a piece of meat?","Well, so does Leonard. Its kind of annoying, but its not the end of the world.",Shes always complaining about people at work.
I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.,"You know, so does Leonard. Cant I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.","Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like Im a piece of meat?"
Have you noticed its always an A-flat?,"You know, one night, Leonards nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.",I told you raccoons dont say uh-oh.
"If were just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.",Is it? Oh. Its like his sinuses are right here in the car.,Have you noticed its always an A-flat?
"Well, see, why cant Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly shes Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.","Yeah, Ill take you for ice cream.","If were just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
"Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.","Oh, please, youre barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?","Well, see, why cant Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly shes Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
"No. No, if we both like it, Ill spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.","Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. Thats your favourite.",Oh. He can try. Hed just need a good locksmith.
"Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arms probably bigger than the other.",What about the girl behind the counter?,"No. No, if we both like it, Ill spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
You are truly wise.,Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?,"Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arms probably bigger than the other."
"Id say wise beyond your years, but youre getting up there.",Thank you.,You are truly wise.
"Penny, I am going to tell you a story that Ive never told anyone.",All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?,"Id say wise beyond your years, but youre getting up there."
"I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.",All right.,"Penny, I am going to tell you a story that Ive never told anyone."
I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.,Not relating. Go on.,"I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
"My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.","Oh, now Im with ya. Okay.",I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
"I know. Its also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first","Oh, thats awful.","My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman."
"We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.","Well, what happened with your dad?","I know. Its also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first"
"Since Amy and I have been living together, weve been bickering like my parents used to.",You poor thing.,"We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.,And youre afraid youre gonna do something like your dad did?,"Since Amy and I have been living together, weve been bickering like my parents used to."
"Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.","Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now youre at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.",Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
"Im sure youre right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.","Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain youre causing her right now?","Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.,Okay.,"Im sure youre right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well."
Hello.,"Oh, hi. Hi.",Were back.
"I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.",Were doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.,How you guys doing?
"Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, Im willing to take our relationship to the next level.",Im very happy for you.,Do you want him back?
"Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?","Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, Im willing to take our relationship to the next level.",Im very happy for you.
"We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.","You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.","Oh, yeah."
"All right, fine. Lets say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope its not a West Coast party, cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party dont stop.",You know what I meant.,"We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
"Oh, dont be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. Thats called teamwork.",Im sorry I mentioned it.,"All right, fine. Lets say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope its not a West Coast party, cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party dont stop."
"You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.",Whats going on here?,"Yeah, well, if its a dollar, youre in luck."
"Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.","Well, thats so nice. Whos coming?","You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch."
"Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.",You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?,"Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
"Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.",Thats an odd mix of people.,"Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious."
You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.,You never went into that haunted house.,"Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
"Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that Im great at surprises.","Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.",You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.

Im so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.,"Its not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.",I cant imagine you being violent.
Sorry Im moving slowly.,I think I hate all of you nerds.,I think youre both cute.
"Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.","Oh, I dont mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like Im walking with my grandma.",Sorry Im moving slowly.
I cant take this any more.  Bert.,"Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.","Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."
"All right, lets do this, Bert? We need to talk.",Come in.,I cant take this any more.  Bert.
"Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.",What happened to you?,"All right, lets do this, Bert? We need to talk."
"I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, Id somehow be unburdened.","Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyones jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, Ill be out of things to wish for.","Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success."
"No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.",Is it working?,"I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, Id somehow be unburdened."
"We, hang on, youre my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, Im my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, Im good to go.","Well, you know, were both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.","No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever."
You know what? This isnt gonna work.,"Great. Now that were friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?","We, hang on, youre my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, Im my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, Im good to go."
"Yes, thats right. I have Amy. In the past, youve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you dont?","Sheldon, wait. You know, youve got a lot to be happy about. Youre at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.",You know what? This isnt gonna work.
"I didnt punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. Im not even sure he knows I did it.",I cant believe you punched Bert.,"It used to. But now that Im rich and successful, I think I can do better."
Professor Hawking.,"Hello, Sheldon.","Hey, Sheldon, Ive got someone here who might make you feel better."
"Thanks, Leonard, now hes not gonna think Im cool.",I understand youre struggling with professional jealousy.,Professor Hawking.
How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?,Its fine. Ive been on The Simpsons.,"Oh, wow, that doesnt seem fair."
"I cant. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.",How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says youre brilliant?,"Dont waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, youre too brilliant."
"What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?",I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.,"I cant. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in."
"Oh, actually, I would.","If were going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?","A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know thats true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and theyre dumb."
Lets take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.,"Great, whatd you have in mind?","Oh, actually, I would."
"You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.","Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.",Lets take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
"You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.","Look, we cant just throw away Pennys stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.","You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.,"Well, Im sure she misses this one. I mean, its the greatest gift Ive ever given anybody.","You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
"Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.",It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.,It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
"Look, its the same smile she has in the painting.",I cant wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.,"Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
"Yeah, theres hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.","Look, its the same smile she has in the painting.",I cant wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
What happened to them?,"Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.","Yeah, theres hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now."
"You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?","Yes, you do.",I seem to be losing.
"That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.",Why dont you keep it?,"You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?"
"Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?","Yeah, I dont need anything around that I can stab myself with.","That seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
"Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.","Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.","Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?"
"Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartments really shaping up.","Fine, take the plant.","Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?,"Yeah, let him do it.",Howard just did that.
Its one of a kind.,Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.,"Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock."
"Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.",So if it breaks thered be none of it?,Its one of a kind.
Ill be right across the hall. Youll probably be able to hear it.,So you think you should keep it?,"Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do."
Thank you.,"Keep the clock, Sheldon.",Ill be right across the hall. Youll probably be able to hear it.
"Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?",Thank you?,Thank you.
"Well, no, I just didnt think youd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.","Let me guess, you want it.","Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?"
Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.,"You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really dont care.","Well, no, I just didnt think youd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games."
"For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?","Well, you know whats gonna happen, hes just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.",Leonard.
"Its not my fault Im bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.","Sheldon, youre, youre being a little selfish. Why dont you let Leonard keep a few things?","For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?"
"Yeah, take whatever you want.",You know what? There is one thing I would like.,"Its not my fault Im bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten."
But you dont even like flags.,I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.,"Yeah, take whatever you want."
But I designed it.,"Yeah, I like this one.",But you dont even like flags.
But you dont even understand its symbolism.,But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and theyd jack up the price.,But I designed it.
"Come along, Amy. I know when Im not wanted.","Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means Im happy about it.",But you dont even understand its symbolism.
"Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isnt Leonard Hofstadter.","Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.","Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the persons boyfriend, but I kind of feel like Im already doing that."
"If its like your 3-D chess game, then youre out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.","Sheldon, Im warning you, I can play this game, too.","Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isnt Leonard Hofstadter."
"All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.","All right, I tried.","If its like your 3-D chess game, then youre out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned."
Its a good thing youre cute.,Ive got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?,"All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn."
What do you think youre doing?,Hey.,"Do something, Batman."
This is the level youre stooping to.,Separating my delicates.,What do you think youre doing?
"So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see youve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. Theyre very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.","Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I dont know what he told you, but you cant stay here.","Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy."
"My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.","Sheldon, what do you think youre doing?","So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see youve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. Theyre very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around."
"Anyway, Ill leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, hes expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.",Its like the 40s again.,"My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
"Thats true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldnt be a man in your kitchen who cant produce a single form of ID.","All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.","Anyway, Ill leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, hes expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them."
And now you know as much about him as I do.,"Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. Im O-negative.","Thats true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldnt be a man in your kitchen who cant produce a single form of ID."
Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think Im running?,"Sheldon, get out here.",I like the painting. Is that your mom?
Im being awful? Youre the one who went out of your way to hurt me.,We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?,Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think Im running?
Dividing our belongings is difficult.,Because you were being selfish.,Im being awful? Youre the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
"I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.","I think he might be right. Also, who is that?","Well, Im just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, youre in a new phase of your lives and its easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another."
"Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.","So, no ones gonna tell me? Okay.","Were good, thank you."
"In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and Im not just saying that because it touched your genitals.","Well, Id like that, too.","Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
"I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.",You promise?,"In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and Im not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
Amy? Wake up.,"I love you, too. Were good.",Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
Its midnight. Happy birthday.,Whats wrong?,Amy? Wake up.
"This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.","Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.",Its midnight. Happy birthday.
A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so Id be ripped.,Ill put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?,"This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
And its not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.,I love it. Thank you.,A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so Id be ripped.
We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.,Sheldon.,And its not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
I didnt put on my come-hither plaid PJs for nothing.,Is that okay?,We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.
"Yeah. Im afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.","I guess, I guess we should stop.","Come on, were going to the hospital."
Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.,"Sheldon, what took you so long?","Im just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days."
Im starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.,"Well, first deliveries can be slow.","Okay, well, well talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. Its gonna be a while."
"It doesnt matter what I want. Its your birthday, you decide.","Oh, uh, I dont know. Sheldon, you dont want to do that, do you?","Well while were all awake, why dont we go to a diner or something?"
"Thats a bit childish, isnt it?","Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!","Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex."
Grape. I find it the most mild.,"Im sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?","Thats a bit childish, isnt it?"
"Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.","So, where were we?","Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard."
"Oh, dont be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.",Im sorry.,"Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
Very well.,"Well, shall we start over?","Oh, dont be. You were like a foxy tea kettle."
"Im not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now its feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.",Whats wrong?,Very well.
"Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think were doing it, and I dont want to disappoint them.","Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the moods a little different now. We, we dont have to rush.","Im not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now its feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels."
"No, and also, I dont want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, its your birthday. I can soldier through this.",And the mood continues to change.,"Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think were doing it, and I dont want to disappoint them."
Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?,Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.,"No, and also, I dont want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, its your birthday. I can soldier through this."
"Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give",No.,Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?,Its not about trains.,"Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give"
Whos killing the mood now?,Stop talking about trains.,Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
Can I look yet?,Youre gonna have to be quieter than that.,"Maybe if were quiet, hell go away."
Wowza.,"One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought Id let Harry Potter make things hotter.",Can I look yet?
"What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.",I got a Gryffindor robe for you.,Wowza.
"Yes, youre in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.",I did. Am I in trouble?,"What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me."
You know Ive been wanting to go.,"Wait, what just happened?","Yes, youre in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me."
"Oh, youre right. Im sorry.","Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?",You know Ive been wanting to go.
Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.,"I know that. But to be fair, Ive spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And Im being generous.","Well, it is their child."
"Shes right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but Im not going to ruin her birthday. Ill wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.","I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?","And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay."
"But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.",Sheldon and I are living together.,Hmm. You two got married.
"I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.","Well, youre all thinking it, Im the only one who hasnt done anything worthwhile.",Whats your problem?
"Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but dont say.","Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and Im every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.","Raj, if its any consolation, Im no better off than I was ten years ago."
"Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didnt swallow it, but Amy said it counted.",Ive come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.,"No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, Im gonna cross my legs and snap em off."
"Some will be successful, some may be homeless. Its fun to think about.","Oh, look at all the babies.","You hear that, Stuart? Ive got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
"It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.","Well, that was quite a day.","Guys, shes my goddaughter, I think Ill know when I see her. That one."
Hello.,"Well, he didnt throw up on the baby. Thats a win.","Oh. Its Bernadette. She says theyre running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard."
"Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.",Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?,Hi.
"Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Dont you maniacs own a calendar?","Well, youre home now.",It was not a great trip.
"It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.",Did you at least have a good flight down there?,I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
"Well, we were on our way to my mothers house","And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.","So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?"
How did we get in the car?,"Well, we were on our way to my mothers house","And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice."
Do we have to? I really dont want to hear the religious lecture.,"So, while were at your mothers house, it might be a good time to tell her that were living together.","I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
"Theres always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.",Maybe there wont be one.,Do we have to? I really dont want to hear the religious lecture.
"Eh, I dont know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.","Well, she likes me. You know, theres a chance she might be okay with it.","Theres always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it."
Anyway,Mm.,Who knows what he has down there.
"Given that your hands prepared it, isnt that a little self-serving?","Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.",Anyway
Welcome to Texas.,"Oh, thats wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?","Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby."
"Oh, wait, wait, shouldnt we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.","They havent said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.",Welcome to Texas.
"All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, Im going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldons not.","Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.","Oh, wait, wait, shouldnt we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes."
"What? Wh, wheres the judgment? Wh, wheres the fire and brimstone? Wheres the part where you tell us were going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? Were already there.","Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.","All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, Im going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldons not."
And what special circumstances are those?,"Obviously, I would prefer if you werent living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, Im very happy for you.","What? Wh, wheres the judgment? Wh, wheres the fire and brimstone? Wheres the part where you tell us were going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? Were already there."
"What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?","Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.","Oh, boy, I think its about to get bad."
"Well, this is highly insulting.",No. Just for the middle part. Cause at the end I assumed thered be nurses.,"What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?"
"Im the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldnt power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.","Sheldon, dont overreact.","Well, this is highly insulting."
"Well, I was in my room, I couldnt hear what they were saying.",What?,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.,"Sheldon, what, what are you doing?","Oh, heck no."
"Yeah. And I dont understand why youre taking her side. By being my girlfriend, shes saying youre a weirdo, too.","Were ignoring the fins, okay.","You startin to see why I didnt go in there? Sheldon, if youre trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head aint changing my mind."
And?,I dont think thats what shes saying.,"Yeah. And I dont understand why youre taking her side. By being my girlfriend, shes saying youre a weirdo, too."
Can you believe my mother thinks were both strange?,Thats exactly what she was saying.,And?
"Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.","Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.",Absolutely not.
"Youre right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonards mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton","You know, Im sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because youre not alone.","Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
"I was going chronologically. Youre right between Koothrappalis father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.",What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?,"Youre right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonards mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton"
I knew we shouldve never mentioned us living together in the first place.,"Well, lets try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.","I was going chronologically. Youre right between Koothrappalis father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy."
"Disagree. Weve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if youd only listened to me.",She was gonna find out eventually.,I knew we shouldve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
Why would you do that?,"Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.","Disagree. Weve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if youd only listened to me."
You managed the situation?,"This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.",Why would you do that?
"So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks Im incapable of running my own life.",Thats right.,You managed the situation?
I have gotten much better at that.,"Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, youre the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, thats a weak spot for you.","So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks Im incapable of running my own life."
What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.,Have you? How am I feeling right now?,I have gotten much better at that.
How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?,"You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.",What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
"Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.",Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?,How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
Yeah. Here. Ill catch you up.,"Oh, its no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.",Sorry were late.
How did we get in the car?,Yeah. Here. Ill catch you up.,"Oh, its no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas."
I was acting odd intentionally.,"On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.","Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
"Well, theres really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.  And here we are.",Okay. Then what happened?,Really? So you can control it?
I dont understand whats wrong with socks.,I dont understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.,Its like I was excited for a present and got socks.
"So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?","By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.",I hope it kills us both.
"Hey, hows life with your baby?",Sure.,"So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?"
To this day Ive never touched Stuart.,Really? Youre never gonna touch their baby?,"Hey, hows life with your baby?"
"Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?","Oh, dont take it so personally, maybe your babys just a jerk.",Everyones a better mom than me.
What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?,Sheldon.,"Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?"
"It says here that up to 80 of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that theyre doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.","Shh, I dont hate you.",Now you hate me too.
"Thank you, Internet. Im telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.","Thank you, Sheldon, Im feeling better now.","It says here that up to 80 of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that theyre doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job."
Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wifes genitals and he gets time off.,"Not me, paternity leave.",Be there bright and early.
"Leonard, ive been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?","Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.",Oh.
Im trying to take more of an interest in other peoples lives.,Why?,"Leonard, ive been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?"
"Thats small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?",Thats nice. I wear a size eight and a half.,Im trying to take more of an interest in other peoples lives.
Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.,Are you gonna laugh at the answer?,"Thats small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?"
"Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection youll come home with. My moneys on fungal. Theyre still having girls night across the hall.","If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and shes taking me.",Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
"At our age, why dont we call it mans night?","So, hang out with me and well have boys night.","Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection youll come home with. My moneys on fungal. Theyre still having girls night across the hall."
"If you do that, ill win in eight moves. Ill win in five moves. Ill win in one move.","Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, thats why I bought the rug.",Did that do anything?
"Oh, Penny, Im trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls night?",Hey.,Hey.
Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?,"Oh, it was fine.","Oh, Penny, Im trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls night?"
Anything to drink?,"Uh, chips.",Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
"Well, Im just playing tennis against the drapes here.",Some wine.,Anything to drink?
"Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.",What? Where is this coming from?,Fine. Lately I kind of feel like youve been taking me for granted.
"Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.","Fine, go ahead.","Okay, you know what? Maybe Ill take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?,Ill call you when we get to the hotel.,Mm-hmm.
You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.,"Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.",Thanks. Are you ready?
Bye.,"Go ahead, its fine.",You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
Bye.,Bye.,Lets go.
"Yeah, Ill miss you too.",Ill miss you.,Bye.
"Well, if x equals the amount that youll miss me, then Ill miss you x plus one.",Ill miss you more.,"Yeah, Ill miss you too."
"Here. Youre sad, so I made you tea.",Thank you.,"If you miss me x plus one, Ill miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second"
And its just the way you like it.,Thanks.,"Here. Youre sad, so I made you tea."
Yes.,Earl grey?,And its just the way you like it.
Yes.,Honey?,Yes.
"Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.",Unsweetened almond,Yes.
"Well, what can we do to cheer you up?","Sorry, thank you.","Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it."
"You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?",I really dont know.,"Well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
"Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isnt the only relationship youre phoning in.","I dont want to play a game, Sheldon.","You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?"
"Hmm. Yeah, youre right. Its like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now Im just like, eh.","Its not that Id stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.","Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isnt the only relationship youre phoning in."
Would you like to play a driving game I invented?,"Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.","Its a tradition of my people.  If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
"Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?",Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?,Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
"Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I dont see why your divorce should be any different.",I dont want to wait two days for us to work this out.,"Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?"
"Hello, Amy. Its nice to see you.","Okay. I dont get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.","Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself."
And thats how you make effort look effortless.,"Nice to see you, too.","Hello, Amy. Its nice to see you."
"You know what? If youd like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, Im at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.",Im trying to figure it out.,I dont understand what you want.
"Very well. Hey, later well check out the minibar, Ill show you how Godzilla gets drunk.","Sheldon, why dont we give them some privacy?","You know what? If youd like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, Im at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing."
Theres a cucumber in my water.,"Bigger problems, I felt something pop.","Hold on, I dont think she was impressed."
"Do they know its there? I mean, should I tell somebody?",Uh-huh.,Theres a cucumber in my water.
"Interesting. The worlds most boring liquid and the worlds most boring vegetable, but you put em together and bleugh.",Its there on purpose. Its refreshing.,"Do they know its there? I mean, should I tell somebody?"
"Oh good, youre here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmass?",Hey.,Hey.
"I get to write a contract? I say, lets get this party of the first part started.",What do you say?,Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
"If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.",Its in our agreement. I have to laugh.,Do you really think thats funny?
"I did this for free, let me get a little something.",Does it really need to say that?,"Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs."
"Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that youre accepting Leonard in as is condition.","Me, too.",I think this all looks good.
Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.,I remember signing our first relationship agreement.,"Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that youre accepting Leonard in as is condition."
"Thats not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?","I dont know, she didnt even give me a reason.",I thought things were going well. What happened?
Doesnt like games. Thats one.,Can we not play this game?,"Thats not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?"
"Of course youre fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made.","Thats okay, Im fine.","Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup."
"So now you think youre better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women dont like you.","Im not a virgin, Sheldon.","Of course youre fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
What? He said he was fine.,Youre not being very nice.,"So now you think youre better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women dont like you."
"Oh, thats a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said.",Sometimes people say things they dont mean.,What? He said he was fine.
"Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive.","Hey, boys. Hows it going?","Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smokes gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey."
Yeah.,"So, normal.","Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive."
"We were discussing Rajs recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.","Sheldon, what did you do?",Yeah.
"Dont fall for it. Hell get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly youre the bad guy.","Its okay, Im fine.","We were discussing Rajs recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him."
Then why didnt you say that?,"Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didnt want to talk about it any more.","Dont fall for it. Hell get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly youre the bad guy."
"Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.",Because thats not what people do.,Then why didnt you say that?
"Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what its like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.","No. No, you dont, you really dont. I actually cant say dont enough.","Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
Thank you.,Im sure its extremely frustrating.,"Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what its like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
"Okay, now youre just showing off.",And also a little sad.,Thank you.
A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.,What do you think?,"You if its at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype."
"It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them.",Wouldnt that be nice.,A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.
You could make it a train room.,I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.,"Now that Sheldons across the hall, have you decided what youre doing with his old room?"
"I know, and Amy says I cant have a train room.",I dont like trains. You like trains.,You could make it a train room.
Wonderful. Although Im not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.,"Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. Theyre sending a prototype for you to beta test.","I know, and Amy says I cant have a train room."
"Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha.","Yeah, I was joking.","No, Raj, thats a terrible idea."
"Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, theyll know that Ive been rooting for them the whole time.",Its amazing a machine can do that.,This things pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.
You are happy?,"Okay, Im looking at the first picture.","Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things youre feeling, like, what have I done with my life?"
"Aw. Somebodys ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right.",Yes. Im looking at puppi,You are happy?
Sad.,Okay. What does it say Im feeling?,Try another one.
"Oh, that makes sense, cause shes gone and you miss her.",Yes. Im looking at a picture of my grandma.,Sad.
"And youre worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says youre mad. Make up your mind.",Yes.,"Oh, that makes sense, cause shes gone and you miss her."
"Hey, Leonard, if youre happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.","He didnt know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.","Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"
Surprisingly well.,Hows it working out?,"Hey, Leonard, if youre happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector."
"No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Arent you sweet?","Thats great, Im happy for you.",Surprisingly well.
"Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.","No, its my brothers. Im trying to help him get a job out here.",Whats that? Are you working on your resume?
"What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. Its this red frowny guy on my phone.","No, it doesnt.","Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry."
Yes.,No.,What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?
Its like youre twins.,I said no.,Yes.
"Well, hey. Now shes angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters.",Hes my brother. I didnt think I needed your permission.,Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didnt bother to ask me first.
Hes still mad.,Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.,Like you talked to me about your gaming room?
You first.,Stop enjoying their fight.,Hes still mad.
"Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.","It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?",Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
You are lucky that this feelings machine doesnt have feelings.,Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.,You gave me a bill at the end of every month.
Gladly. Can we storm out?,"Come on, Sheldon, lets go.",You are lucky that this feelings machine doesnt have feelings.
Fine. Ill just give them the finger.,I think it loses its impact if were chatting about it.,Gladly. Can we storm out?
Not really.,"Sheldon, dinners ready. I made beef loaf, because I know youre uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?","Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed."
"I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it.",Whats going on?,Not really.
"Its more than that. Its me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other peoples emotions, but that machine just made it so real.",Im sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.,"I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it."
"I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly Im not.","Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I cant see without my glasses. And right now youre just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.","Its more than that. Its me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other peoples emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
"Yeah, but thats shooting fish in a barrel. Youre kind of a sad sack. Im sorry, I shouldnt have said that. Im just upset.","Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.","I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly Im not."
"I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird.","No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And Im proud of you, for reasons Im sure have something to do with my father. And if you dont like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are.","Yeah, but thats shooting fish in a barrel. Youre kind of a sad sack. Im sorry, I shouldnt have said that. Im just upset."
Yes?,"Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.","Honestly, Im surprised you two didnt wind up together."
"Oh, its fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasnt home, you borrowed a suitcase.",We owe you an apology.,Yes?
"Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order.",That was six years ago. Im talking about tonight.,"Oh, its fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasnt home, you borrowed a suitcase."
"Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that youve resolved your conflict.","And, sorry about the suitcase.","Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
"Uh, guys, it sounds like youre getting angry again.","Oh, Im gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal.",So youre gonna throw me under the bus?
Yes. I dont need an emotion machine. I am one.,Thats because we are.,"Uh, guys, it sounds like youre getting angry again."
"I did. You know, Im not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad.","So, did you wind up sending that machine back?","Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, dont tell me, I want to be surprised."
"Hey, uh, Bernadette, lets test this theory. What do you think Im feeling right now?",We cant. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.,"So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up."
"Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.",Those are just the things I say out loud.,"Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
"Im looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.",Whats wrong?,"Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
"Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? Ill tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but thats just poodle politics.",Yeah. It doesnt need to be smaller.,"Thats great, but the Air Force approved the specs. Were good to go."
"Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.",Can we please stop talking about poodles?,"Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? Ill tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but thats just poodle politics."
I dont want to go home.,"Sheldon, we dont need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home.","Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do."
Then what?,"Fine, go for a little walk.",I dont want to go home.
"Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as thats not a urinary tract infection, thats a personal best.","You cant kill him, hell just respawn at the last save point.","We can just lock the door, you dont have to kill him."
Really?,"Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.","Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as thats not a urinary tract infection, thats a personal best."
"Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesnt happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again.","Yeah. Go ahead, open it.",Really?
"Youll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.","Hey, youre home early.",Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.
No idea. All I know is Im gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.,Wow. He finally used it. Whatd you do?,"Youll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive."
"Oh, no. Its not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.","Well, Im really happy for you.",No idea. All I know is Im gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
You.,I give up.,"Oh, no. Its not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
"Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is theres no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is its not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, theyll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.",No. I really give up.,You.
"Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. Theres forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? Youre missing",Can I pee now?,"Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is theres no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is its not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, theyll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldnt hear you. Im welding this locomotive engine. And if you didnt knock, how about some manners?","I dont know, but if he yells Its alive, we run.","Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?"
"I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldnt, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.",Howd you even get that up the stairs?,"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldnt hear you. Im welding this locomotive engine. And if you didnt knock, how about some manners?"
"Interesting. Well, so I was right.","Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we cant do it without you.","I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldnt, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
"Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I dont think I can go back to theory. Im an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.",Open a window. Its about to get smug in here.,"Interesting. Well, so I was right."
Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I wont look foolish.,"Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.","Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I dont think I can go back to theory. Im an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are."
"Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo.","Come on, you know youre not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?",Hes worried about looking foolish. Thats a heapin helping of irony right there.
"Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and Im okay with it.",No.,Thats right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasnt even that hard.
"No, thanks. Im busy trying to fix this fuel pump.",Arent you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?,"Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and Im okay with it."
"Oh. Well, I guess its fixed.",Its a manifold.,"No, thanks. Im busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
Thats wrong.,Just look at the board.,"Oh. Well, I guess its fixed."
"Well, first of all, you cant use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.","Oh, no, what should we have done differently?",Thats wrong.
"Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads.",Told ya. Can you fix it for us?,"Well, first of all, you cant use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. Im already king of the train store.,"And with all these new skills, youd be able to fix any model train. Youd be the king of the train store.","And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
"Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. Im like the crankshaft of this team.","So, what do you say?",Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. Im already king of the train store.
"Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. Im gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.",Thats a turbo.,"Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. Im like the crankshaft of this team."
I apologize that its so warm in here.,"Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. Im gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.",Thats a turbo.
Ive worked up a bit of a sweat.,It is warm in here.,I apologize that its so warm in here.
May I borrow your water?,"Me, too.",Ive worked up a bit of a sweat.
The lights green.,May I borrow your water?,"Me, too."
GPS says well be at the railway in three hours.,Sorry.,The lights green.
Theres no way.,You can do this.,"Go. Come on, Raj."
"Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.",Were betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.,"Aw, look at you watching sports."
Kind of busy right now.,"Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.","Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says Ill lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
Hes not gonna make it.,How ya doing?,Oh. Immature.
"You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.","Yes, he is.",Hes not gonna make it.
Its slowing down.,"Ha, youre interested. Youre out ten bucks.","Yeah, see, whats happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?"
Hes not gonna make it.,"Dig deep, like when we bet you couldnt fit into Howards pants.",Its slowing down.
"Oh, I wont. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didnt see that.",The food heres supposed to be great. Dont fill up on chips.,Youre also too sensitive. Women dont want that either.
Why?,"Oh, look. Its Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi.","Oh, I wont. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didnt see that."
I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.,Because thats what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.,Why?
"If the judge couldnt explain it to me, I dont see how you will.","Sheldon, theres a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.",I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Hello.,"Hi, Bert.","If the judge couldnt explain it to me, I dont see how you will."
"Well, have a lovely evening.",Yeah. Their slogan is were all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind.,Thats a real thing?
"If you think thats more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, youre crazy.","Thanks. You, too.","Well, have a lovely evening."
"MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?","Yeah. Shoes, Im a seven-and-a-half, boots, Im an eight.","Thank you, Penny."
"Bert, I insist that you join us.",Im so sorry.,"Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, its time to cut bait."
Not at all. Amy?,You really wouldnt mind?,"Bert, I insist that you join us."
"Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.","Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.",Thanks. Ill go grab a chair.
You want me to look at him and listen to him?,So the part where he got stood up didnt clue you in?,"Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
"Actually, we met online.",All right. How did you guys meet?,"Okay, literally any other topic."
"Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again.",Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.,"Actually, we met online."
"No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.",Were you aware of this?,"Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does."
Why arent you talking to me?,"No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.",Were you aware of this?
"Oh. Well, now Im sorry I asked.",Because Im mad at you.,Why arent you talking to me?
What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.,"Sheldon, its humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.","Oh. Well, now Im sorry I asked."
"Is it safe to assume youre not speaking to me again? If youre not answering because youre not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works.",Thats why theyre doing it.,What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.
"Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together.",Im going to bed.,Im spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs 300.
"Im not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the mans supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, youre clearly more sofa-sized.",So?,"Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together."
This isnt fair. Youve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.,Im not sleeping on the couch because you dont know whats private and whats not.,"Im not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the mans supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, youre clearly more sofa-sized."
"That lady has a name. I dont know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom.","Thats different. Shes a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches.",This isnt fair. Youve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
Amy?,Yeah.,"Okay, only if youre sure. Whew."
"Not exactly the welcome wagon, but Ill take it.",Yeah?,Amy?
"Im mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Dont Google that unless you want to see pictures of peoples genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as Im saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.",What is this?,"Not exactly the welcome wagon, but Ill take it."
"No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.",Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?,"Im mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Dont Google that unless you want to see pictures of peoples genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as Im saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here."
"Im sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.","Well, I do appreciate you working on this.","No, I was just excited to list him as a friend."
Thats reserved for thoughts I dont share with anyone.,Whats that little dot in the middle?,"Im sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink."
Of course.,Interesting. You really have secrets you dont tell me?,Thats reserved for thoughts I dont share with anyone.
"No, theyre private.",Can I hear one?,Of course.
A little.,Why? Are they naughty?,"No, theyre private."
Fine. Two years ago I got my drivers license.,Please?,A little.
I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.,What? Why didnt you say anything?,Fine. Two years ago I got my drivers license.
"No, you didnt. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.","So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didnt have to?",I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.
"Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. Were scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other peoples lives.","Uh, I gave her an Imodium. Thats tomorrows problem.",Oh. Hows the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
"Thank you, Bert. Youre a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.",Hes right. And Im sorry for the part I played in this.,"Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. Were scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other peoples lives."
"Oh. Oh, Im sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.  That better?",That doesnt paint me in the best light.,"Thank you, Bert. Youre a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
"All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other peoples business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.",Not really.,"Oh. Oh, Im sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.  That better?"
"Well, last night Amy was angry with me because Id been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.",What brought that on?,"All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other peoples business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert."
Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.,Thats understandable.,"Well, last night Amy was angry with me because Id been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
"Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?",How bad is it?,Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.
Im not wearing this visor to play womens golf.,Are you serious?,"Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
"Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping.","Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?",Were helping Raj figure out his finances.
He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.,"Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.","Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?,I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.,I thought your dad paid your cards.
"No, absolutely not. You cant afford to hire someone wholl forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.",Like a business manager?,Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
He sounds like a sociopath.,What if theres someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?,"No, absolutely not. You cant afford to hire someone wholl forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it."
Youre talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.,"We dont know, his mother never had him tested.",He sounds like a sociopath.
"Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You cant buy one.","Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, Im putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you dont authorize.","Wait, wait, whos gonna break it to the penguin?"
Shes gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.,"No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldons job.",You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?
Shes gonna hate the panels.,And hate all the crowds at the panels.,Shes gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
"You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.","I cant believe Pennys gonna get to go, and Im not.",That I would do to her.
"You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.",Panels. Just wanted to be included.,"You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
"Your father may have spoiled you, but I wont. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.","Okay, youre right, I got myself into this, but Ive never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.",See? Miserable.
Im gonna go as Dumbledore.,"Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you cant afford it, Howards gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.","Well, so? So you think Bernadettes just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?"
Thats probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.,"I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go.","Dont worry, we wont be doing much sleeping anyway. Its like an all-night party. Theres trivia contests and Dungeons  Dragons. As we like to say, its off the chain mail."
"If I may speak for Comic-Con, we dont want that either.",Now were going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I dont want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.,"Okay, good, cause thats what I want, too."
"No, but its honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.",Is that nice?,"If I may speak for Comic-Con, we dont want that either."
"Im always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When theres hair growing out of it, thats a mole.","Uh, its more complicated than that.","No, but its honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
"I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, Id like to think she meant it.",Do you think shes as honest with you?,"Im always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When theres hair growing out of it, thats a mole."
Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.,Penny says theyre ready to go.,"Yeah, thats working out great for me."
"I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?","Sheldon, women can wear make up, its not lying.",Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.
He doesnt really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. Hes just doing it to make her happy.,"Wait, wait, wait, whats Leonard lying about?","I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
"So theyre both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? Thats hilarious. I cant wait to tell them.",Really? Because she doesnt actually want to go. Shes just doing it to make him happy.,He doesnt really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. Hes just doing it to make her happy.
Why?,"No, youre not gonna tell them anything. Youre gonna stay out of it.","So theyre both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? Thats hilarious. I cant wait to tell them."
"Well, if you havent noticed, Ive been between them for the last ten years.",Because its between them.,Why?
Hello.,Hi.,Hey.
Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.,I dont have a problem with your driving.,"No, its fine, I know you dont like the way I drive."
This is an interesting way to stay out of it.,Because you dont want her to go to Comic-Con.,Why would I be upset?
"Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, thats why she doesnt want to go. You set em up, I knock em down, good job.","Well, I just dont think youre gonna have a good time.","Wait, you dont want me to go?"
"Not entirely, the fight over whos going to drive is still",Okay.,"All right, problem solved."
"Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.","Thank you, but it doesnt look like Im going to Comic-Con this year.","Hey, if youre still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket."
Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?,Keep it. Consider it a gift.,I would.
"When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.",Whats the difference?,Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?
"Im a big boy, and if I missed one, Id throw a big-boy tantrum.","Ive been plenty of times. If I miss one, its fine. Im a big boy.",So youre not going to Comic-Con?
"Nuts to that, Im going to Comic-Con.",Sounds like everyones staying home. What do you say?,Im gonna go check on dinner.
Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.,By yourself?,"Nuts to that, Im going to Comic-Con."
"Thats very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.",Ill go with you.,Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.
Theres my pretty girlfriend.,"Thats very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.",Ill go with you.
What? Cant a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?,Im not going with you to Comic-Con.,Theres my pretty girlfriend.
"I know our apartments small, but I think we can make room.","Oh, were smarter than that.",You want to let him live here?
Wow. Im starting to think you didnt mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.,"For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.","Lets hope he thinks so, too."
"Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, its unclear whether its yours or mine.",Hi.,Hey.
Roofing.,Whats it for?,"Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, its unclear whether its yours or mine."
"Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, Im given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.","Yeah, its yours.",Roofing.
What about his dog?,"Yeah, for a little while.","Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, Im given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room."
I suppose thats acceptable.,"Shell be in her crate, its not a big deal.",What about his dog?
"If real dogs gave me buttons, Id like them, too. Well, I think its very nice that youre helping out our friend.","Well, Sheldons getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.",I suppose thats acceptable.
And what is that supposed to mean?,And I think its nice that youre taking whatever medication Amys clearly giving you.,"If real dogs gave me buttons, Id like them, too. Well, I think its very nice that youre helping out our friend."
"If youre implying that Id have some problem with him moving into my room, youre wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and Im glad that hes making changes to improve it.",Mm-hmm.,Just when I thought you couldnt get any hotter.
"I mean, its unfair; people just assume Im going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.",Dont listen to them. Whats weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.,Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.
"Oh, Im outraged.","But you are, arent you?","I mean, its unfair; people just assume Im going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room."
"Well, thats been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who arent me.",Talk to me. Tell me whats going on.,"Oh, Im outraged."
Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.,"There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.","Well, thats been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who arent me."
"I realize its irrational, but with Raj moving in there, Im feeling a bit replaced.",And there is the love of which I speak.,Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.
"Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?","Well, this isnt an easy time for him. Hes losing his apartment, hes in debt, hes probably humiliated.","I realize its irrational, but with Raj moving in there, Im feeling a bit replaced."
All set.,You ready to go?,I dont know. Yours looks like he has worms.
A housewarming gift for Raj.,Whats that?,All set.
"Its nothing like that. I just, I thought about Rajs situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello.","Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, cause that was a lousy anniversary present.",A housewarming gift for Raj.
"Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj.",Perfect timing. Foods ready.,Hi.
"Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and Im sure you will, too.","Thank you, Sheldon. Its a blank notebook.",No. I already asked.
"Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. Youre losing your apartment, youre in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated.",This means a lot.,He also never had sex in that room. Thats something else to look forward to.
"Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amys words.",Sheldon.,"Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. Youre losing your apartment, youre in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
"I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.",Sheldon.,"Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amys words."
Can you believe this guy?,"Youre right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. Youre such a jerk.","I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez."
I thought that was gonna break the other way.,Yes.,Can you believe this guy?
Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope youre happy.,"Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place.",I thought that was gonna break the other way.
How come he can say it and I cant?,What do I have to be happy about? My lifes a wreck.,Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope youre happy.
"Honestly, Ive been better. Do you have time? Leonard says youre very busy these days.","Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?",Just keep walking.
"Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and its brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.","Oh, I just say that because he prattles. Whats going on?","Honestly, Ive been better. Do you have time? Leonard says youre very busy these days."
"Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?","Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?","Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and its brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
I have.,"Very well, but, uh, if you dont mind, Id still like to pause for effect. Now, youve recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?","Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
I hadnt thought about that.,"Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, youre forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.",I have.
"I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, youre good.",Interesting. Theyve found a need to take yet another room mate. Seems theyre avoiding some harsh realities themselves.,This isnt about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.
"Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?",Thatll do it.,Do you actually pay for that haircut?
"Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend shes stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.","Sheldon, shes fine.","Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
"No, I cant take all the credit. I spoke with Leonards mother, and she made me feel better.",Thank you. I appreciate that.,"Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend shes stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you."
"Beverly pointed out that Im experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.","I dont know who you talked to, but that wasnt my mother.","No, I cant take all the credit. I spoke with Leonards mother, and she made me feel better."
"Yes, youre fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now its Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, Im sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while theyre fighting, theyll take you to McDonalds.",What are you talking about? Were fine.,"Beverly pointed out that Im experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship."
I cant sleep.,You okay?,Never shouldve had all these kids so close together.
Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.,Whats wrong?,I cant sleep.
Yes. I dont care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.,Is that bothering you?,Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
What if shes correct? Doesnt that say something troubling about us?,"I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.",Yes. I dont care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.
That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?,I dont know. I just think youre the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.,What if shes correct? Doesnt that say something troubling about us?
"Penny would be the entree. Then Leonards basically a cheese course. And because I love you, youre dessert.",Better than I feel in their steam shower? I dont think so.,Wouldnt you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
"Amy, quick, lock the door.","Just one second. Help, Cinnamons loose in the building.",Dont you want to get dressed first?
"You know what? Im proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, were the only couple of our social group who doesnt need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party.","Hey, thats no way to talk about your baby.",Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.,"Well, shes done.","Okay, and tree pose."
"Oh, the project is classified. I cant tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the  Wow, I wonder what theyre redacting.",Thats great. How so?,Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.
"Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.",Why dont you ask me what Im working on?,"Oh, the project is classified. I cant tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the  Wow, I wonder what theyre redacting."
So youre attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.,Im doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.,"Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts."
"Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.","Yes, Im trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place.",So youre attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
"Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.","You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something.","Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
"Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?","Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it.","Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
"Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so Ill wait.",He does raise an interesting point.,"The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didnt get any food."
"Well, dont get me wrong. Neurobiologys nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, were going for a drive.",Its nice to see you taking an interest in Amys work.,"Im sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?"
"I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.","You know, I like harp lessons, but Im thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?",I went to your office Christmas party?
It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.,"Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?","I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation."
"Yeah, and this one wont stain my teeth purple.","Sheldon, this is really interesting.",It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.,"You know, weve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?","Yeah, and this one wont stain my teeth purple."
"All right, lets start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.","Well, that would make me feel better.",That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
Is it?,Thats a ridiculous rule.,"All right, lets start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
I believe Ive made some progress on our ground rules.,"Or we could do something well all enjoy, like play a board game.","Ooh, yes. Fun."
"Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,","Oh, good. What are they?",I believe Ive made some progress on our ground rules.
"Oh, of course. Ill get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper.",Can I see that?,"Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,"
"Id write that down, but I cant now, can I?","Sheldon, if were gonna have ground rules, Ill tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules.","Oh, of course. Ill get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper."
"Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same things gonna happen.","Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.","Oh, its just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isnt that right, Halley?"
Fire away.,Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?,"Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same things gonna happen."
"Thats smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0.","Number one, were on the same team, were not in competition.",Fire away.
"Aw, someone drew a penis in it.","Number two, disagreements can happen politely. Theres no need to call an idea stupid.","Thats smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0."
"Im sorry, go ahead.",Are you listening?,"Aw, someone drew a penis in it."
"Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, were talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.","Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.","Im sorry, go ahead."
"Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be.","Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?","Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, were talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me."
"Yes, this is remarkable.",Wow. Look at that.,"Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be."
"By the way, your name can go first.","So were agreed, its complete garbage.","Yes, this is remarkable."
"Yeah, the math is so inelegant. Im not even sure it makes sense.",I dont know where we went wrong.,You sure you dont fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.
Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.,"Well, dont give up. Maybe we can fix it.","Yeah, the math is so inelegant. Im not even sure it makes sense."
"All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races.","I can hear your face talking, so were even.",Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.
"No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, thats me. Never mind, its fine.","Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, Ill blow it. Better?","All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races."
"Hold on. I see whats wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.","You know, youre exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea.","No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, thats me. Never mind, its fine."
"Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, wed be in good shape.",That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.,"Hold on. I see whats wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
"Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean Im sensitive.","I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didnt say anything cause youre so sensitive.","Oh, then maybe you shouldnt talk to her."
That is a daring and insightful solution.,"Hey, I wonder what kind of success wed have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.","Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean Im sensitive."
What if the fighting is the reason were making progress?,Were finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.,That is a daring and insightful solution.
"Well, if thats the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.",I suppose its conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.,What if the fighting is the reason were making progress?
"It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.","How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero.","Well, if thats the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
Science it is.,Theres only one clear choice.,"It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
"Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, Im not the sharpest dresser.","No, you bonehead.",Science it is.
Can you read them back?,"I dont know, you pretty much covered it.",Im sorry. What did you want to say?
"Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, youre going down, punk.","Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition.",Can you read them back?
I love that one.,"Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face.","Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, youre going down, punk."
Hello.,"Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, dont answer. Id love to.","Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?"
Because I am.,Why did you tell Leonard youre working on the gyroscope tomorrow?,Hello.
"I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.",Uh-oh. Someones got two dates to the nerd prom.,But you said you were working with me.
"Well, Im not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.","Im sorry, what is this plan you have?","I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom."
"Soon. See, I couldve said in the near future, but I didnt say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already.",When does that start?,"Well, Im not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
"Gentlemen, Ive got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?","Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldons a genius? But I didnt.","Soon. See, I couldve said in the near future, but I didnt say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
"These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever Im thirsty I have access to water. When Im hungry, I have lentil soup.","Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?","Gentlemen, Ive got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?"
Run down the pros and cons of each for me.,"Anyway, Sheldon, were at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter.",Its getting harder to pretend.
"Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.","Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, itll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.",Run down the pros and cons of each for me.
"Ah, Im back, you got me for eight minutes.",You can just feel the time being saved.,"Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
"The coefficient isnt lambda, its lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?","Sheldon, this is silly. You cant expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.","Ah, Im back, you got me for eight minutes."
Its five and a half.,Seven.,Four.
BRB. Thats short for be right back. Im saving so much time.,"Son of a bitch, its five and a half.",Its five and a half.
The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.,BRB. Thats short for be right back. Im saving so much time.,"Son of a bitch, its five and a half."
"You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? Thatll never work. Spoiler, works.","Incredible. Sheldon, I didnt expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.",The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
"Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way.","I got to admit, we didnt think youd be able to do two things at once.","You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? Thatll never work. Spoiler, works."
"Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.","Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?",Your secret is safe with me.
"Well, we have had some fun, havent we?","You know, there was a time I would say whats a soup sack? But Im glad were past that.  You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didnt mean Thor? And then you would say Touch, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say","Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack."
"Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasnt stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.","Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me youve had a busy day.","Well, we have had some fun, havent we?"
Of course not. Im too busy to be sick.,Are you getting sick?,"Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasnt stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
Im fine.,"Well, youre pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldnt be pushing yourself so hard.",Of course not. Im too busy to be sick.
That didnt happen.,"All right. Well, well just pretend that you didnt catch a cold watching Frozen.",Im fine.

"I am fine. Here, eat your toast.  Sorry.","Sheldon, youre sick, go back to bed.","Why dont you think shes fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street Id say, damn, that girls fine."
"Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. Its nothing a little cold medicine and tea cant fix.","Its okay, now I dont need butter.","I am fine. Here, eat your toast.  Sorry."
What I need is to get to work.,You need sleep.,"Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. Its nothing a little cold medicine and tea cant fix."

"Wheres my notebook? My notebooks gone. Oh, no.",Its right here.,"Wait, wait. Wheres my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag."
Whats the big deal? Its full of classified information about the air force project.,"Okay, its just a notebook, whats the big deal?","Wheres my notebook? My notebooks gone. Oh, no."
Thats it. Im in breach of my security clearance. Im going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. Ill be forced to be some large mans tutor.,"Well, its not across the hall.","Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."
Im trying.,You really cant remember anything?,"But, boy, it is funny to think about."
Why?,"Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.",Im trying.
What does it say?,"Hang on, I can see every place you went.","I dont even run there, I drive."
Where?,"Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.",What does it say?
"I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe.","Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?",Where?
Its hard to say.,Does this place look familiar?,Im not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
Its getting clearer.,Sheldon!,"Hey, Sheldons back."
"Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.",You gonna buy another round for the house?,Its getting clearer.

"Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we dont literally mean these flags. Thats just where we have dinner.","Its fun with flags, behind the flags, a retrospective. Flags.",Thats equally effective.
"So lets hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds.","Now, Im sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.","Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we dont literally mean these flags. Thats just where we have dinner."
Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.,Could have played that on my harp.,"So lets hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds."
"Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations",I honestly dont remember.,Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.
"Oh, and do you remember what you said?","Oh, wait. I remember.","Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations"
And thats exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.,Yes. Please find someone who cares.,"Oh, and do you remember what you said?"
"And now were going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments.",Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.,And thats exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.
"Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?","Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. Its Bert.","And dont get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying.  Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags."
"Bert, youre tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.",Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.,And what does that have to do with flags?
Wheres Howard?,"You leave her with me, and Im not any of those things.",Theyre highly-trained educators with background checks. Theyre even required to be current on all vaccinations.
"Oh, lets take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. Ill go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I dont know where I am.",He took the day off.,Wheres Howard?
"Oh, hello.","Hey, guys.",Yeah.
"Ah-ah-ah, hes a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.",Hey. Want to join us?,"Oh, hello."
"Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.","So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.","Oh, quick, sit."
Hold on. We dont know anything about this woman.,"Hey, were all having dinner tonight. Why dont the two of you join us?","Well, Im very happy for you."
Is she a geologist?,What do you want to know?,Hold on. We dont know anything about this woman.
"Oh great, see you at seven.",No.,Is she a geologist?
Shes younger and far more attractive than he is. Theyre copying you two.,Hey.,Hi.
"Bert, Rebecca. Id like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.","Actually, Im not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist.",So is this your first time dating a scientist? Cause Im thinking of starting a support group.
See? It was fine. I didnt need a time-out.,Dont worry about it. Its fine.,"Bert, Rebecca. Id like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.,It wasnt a time-out. Lets get some food.,See? It was fine. I didnt need a time-out.
"Whatd you do, delete your photo?","I didnt either, until I revamped my profile.",Thats nice. I havent had much success meeting people online.
Fine.,Go.,"Whatd you do, delete your photo?"
"Aw, man.",And dont you slam that door.,Fine.
"Id say shes copying you again, but Im getting tired of sitting in the hall.","I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didnt really work out.","So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?,"She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.","Im sorry, Bert, but arent you worried shes only with you for your money?"
Whos ready to laugh?,"Shes not gonna see us all day, and she doesnt even care.",Thats good.
"Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears",O-o-o-o-oh.,Whos ready to laugh?
"Thats a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.",Im gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.,I think it shows a lot of character.
"Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet.",What are you looking at?,"Hang on, Halley, were busting you out of there."
Hes not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.,"No, I miss her. I dont know why I listened to you.","Oh. You know, good for you."
You and Leonard dont have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.,"Look, sweetie, relationships arent about money, okay? Its about respect and having things in common and yes, Sheldon?","No, you didnt. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who werent right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now Im alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
"Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, youre at the top of the list. Unless its Raj, in which case, well probably get a person of colour.",You dont have to go. Youre welcome to hang with us.,Sorry again for barging in.
So hes using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?,I feel bad for Bert.,"You guys are nice, but Im just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back."
"Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.","Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?",All that and hes shorter than me.
Hello. Im Dr. Sheldon Cooper.,"Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go.",Any time.
"Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together.",And Im Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.,Hello. Im Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
"Ooh, we already have our first call.",Fun with Flags: Behind the Behind the Flags: A Retrospective Retrospective.,"So welcome to tonights episode,"
"Okay, one second.","Sheldon, get over here and help.",We cant get through.
Im trying to shoot.,"Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?","Okay, one second."

"Well, I dont like it.",Kids are always better at video games.,What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.
"No, but its not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.","Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.","Well, I dont like it."
"I guess I just need to face it, Im no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder whats for lunch.","Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.","Oh, so our love is not real?"
Yay.,Hot dogs.,"I guess I just need to face it, Im no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder whats for lunch."
Ive been thinking about our recent humiliation.,"Cool, Ill check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me.","Uh, yeah, sure, Ill check with Leonard."
At the hands of those teenagers.,Youre gonna have to be more specific.,Ive been thinking about our recent humiliation.
Boy teenagers.,More.,At the hands of those teenagers.
"I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging.","Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.",Boy teenagers.
"The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.","Now, this is rare. I dont know which one of you I want to stop talking first.","You know whos a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?"
"Well, its not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.","How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?","Boy, it is neck and neck right now."
Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha.,"If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.","I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk."
Hey.,Hey.,I didnt ask.
Raj is teaching me to make croissants.,What smells so good?,Hey.
"Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, its like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.",Is this part of your super-aging?,Raj is teaching me to make croissants.
"Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what cant I do?","Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. Its light, its flaky, its buttery. You dont need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.","Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, its like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control."
"For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.","Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.","Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what cant I do?"
Youre just using food to mask the fear that youre fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.,"You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.","For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you."
"It really doesnt matter, as long as its challenging.","All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?","Yeah, right? Its funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but thats my favourite."
"Howard, Im trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.","Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.","It really doesnt matter, as long as its challenging."
"Okay, I think I got that.","And its hard, isnt it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?","Yes, Im juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
"Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting jugglers elbow?","No, its if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.",Is it Im going to die alone?
Are you sure? Cause Im feeling a twinge.,No.,"Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting jugglers elbow?"
"Amy, look, Im on a unicycle!","Of course I dont want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isnt very smart. You dont have to stop, just slow down, Ill jump out.",You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.
I hurt myself juggling.,How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?,"Amy, look, Im on a unicycle!"
"Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.",Where did you get it?,I hurt myself juggling.
"What, are you crazy? Im on a unicycle.",Have you tried letting go of the rope?,"Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever."
"Wait, I need help getting down.","All right, well, have fun.","What, are you crazy? Im on a unicycle."
"Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.","Well, what do you want me to do?","Wait, I need help getting down."
Im returning this stuff to Howard.,What are you doing?,"Oh, no, shes gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
"Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.","Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didnt want it, wed give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?",Im returning this stuff to Howard.
"Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, Id wear cargo pants.","You said juggling was dumb, too.","Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
Are you calling me a quitter?,"Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?","Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, Id wear cargo pants."
This conversation is over.,"Well, if you honestly",Are you calling me a quitter?
Thank you.,I made you tea.,"Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like Im being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying."
"Its okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me.",Im sorry I called you a quitter.,Thank you.
This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.,What are you reading?,"Its okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me."
So Im running out of time.,So?,This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.
"Oh, you have to say that, youre sweet on me.","Thats ridiculous, youre a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.",So Im running out of time.
"Hey, I thought you were sweet on me.","Well, if youre really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.","Oh, you have to say that, youre sweet on me."
Youre so cute. Im gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.,"Okay, fine, lets say you never win a Nobel Prize. Lets say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what youve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldnt that be a life well-lived?","Hey, I thought you were sweet on me."
"Thank you. No bendy straw, some party.","And for the worlds tallest second grader, apple juice.",Thank you.
To success without Raj.,Without me.,"Yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
"Yeah, Ill definitely live long enough. Vitamin C.","Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.",So what happens next?
"I hope his character doesnt make it into the movie, hes kind of a bummer.",Without me.,"First thing tomorrow morning, were back at it."
Who else has access to this room?,Where is everything?,What the hell?
This is disconcerting.,"Its a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us.",Who else has access to this room?
Where did you move it?,"You guys completed phase one, well take it from here.",But why would you do that?
"Wait, so youre just going to take all the work weve done for the last year and toss us aside?",I cant tell you that.,Are you implementing phase two?
"If thats sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.","Im sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is peoples feelings.",This is all very upsetting.
"You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. Its too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. Theyre erasing our lives.",I cant believe the Air Force would treat us like that.,How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?
"Its okay, everythings here.","She might disappear, but shes definitely not cleaning anything.","Although, if anyones gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, itd be Penny."
"I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out hes the other kind.",They wouldnt say.,Youre kidding. Why would they do that?
Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?,"Sheldon, Im so sorry.","I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out hes the other kind."

"Well, I thought that, too, but Ive come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.","Oh. Thats sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own.","Youre so kind. You know, I dont know how I ever got by without you."
"No, to wake up every morning and know youre there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?","Sheldon, youre, youre being silly.","Well, I thought that, too, but Ive come to realize, I am completely dependent on you."
"Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that.","You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new.","No, to wake up every morning and know youre there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?"
Im confused. Youre always saying that you want to spend more time with me.,"Oh, I dont know, I mean, lets say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of breads still three bucks.","Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that."

"No, but that list was sounding a little thin.",Do you really care about that last one?,"Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall."
So trick her.,"Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that youre a loving and supportive boyfriend.","No, but that list was sounding a little thin."

Im sorry you had to go through that.,"Its so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you werent there to correct my grammar.","I miss you, too."
You know you just split an infinitive.,"In fact, thats when I started to really miss you.",Im sorry you had to go through that.

"Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, Shes back at Caltech for her postdoc.",He doesnt; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.,"Oh, why does he need a ladder?"

Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.,Not til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory.,"So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
"And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.",Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.,"Nowitzki. I googled her, shes pretty cute."
"Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?",Sounds like a big night.,"And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
"Oh, not at all. Ive had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch",So youre keeping busy? Youre not lonely?,"Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
"Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.",Whos he?,"Oh, not at all. Ive had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch"
"Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. Shes always been a huge fan of my work, and now shes doing research at Caltech.","Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?","Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman."

"Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki.",The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.,Thank you.
We just went swimming.,Hi.,"Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki."
"I was scared, but I told myself its just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub.",And you actually got in a pool?,We just went swimming.

"Yes, we skyped this morning and Im sure Ill check in with her before I go to sleep.","So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?",Can I just squeeze in here?
That is true. She keeps asking how long Amys going to be gone.,Sheldon talks about her all the time. I cant wait to meet her.,"Yes, we skyped this morning and Im sure Ill check in with her before I go to sleep."
"Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?","Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?",That is true. She keeps asking how long Amys going to be gone.
She was part of the American team at CERN.,I think you made that very clear.,"No, my work doesnt leave me a lot of time for relationships."
"Do you know, Ive corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?",I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.,She was part of the American team at CERN.

Here you go.,"You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.",You think you should call Amy?

"I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? Shes right here.",I was missing you again.,"Oh, hello, Amy."

"I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Dont you agree?",Its not important.,What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?

"Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says Im tired and have to go to bed.",No. I havent played the race card yet.,You done trying to make yourself feel better?

"Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I dont think thats whats happening.","Lets forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe","Although, Amys already taken me out of my package and played with me."
I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my rsum to include swimming as a special skill.,All right. What do you think is happening?,"Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I dont think thats whats happening."
"Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.","Hey, did you eat yet?","Dont look at me like that, I tried."
